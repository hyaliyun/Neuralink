(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states.

Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce.

Check your description of plan benefits for information on behavioral health services or coverage for mental health. When in doubt, ask the human resources representative of your insurance company directly. And, ask the therapist if they accept your insurance before making your first appointment. Otherwise you may have to pay out of pocket when you could be seeing a therapist in your insurer's network. When you meet, remember to take care of payment, scheduling, and insurance questions at the start of the session. This way you will be able to end the session sharing, without the disturbance of logistical issues like calendar checking and payment. Know that if you see a therapist in a private practice, they may provide you with a receipt that you will submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. You might be responsible for the entire cost of the visit up front, and then be reimbursed through your insurance company. Therapists come from many different backgrounds, and have different forms of education, specialization, certification, and licensing. \\"Psychotherapist\\" is a general term, rather than a specific job title or indication of education, training or licensure. The following are red flags, indicating that the therapist may not be properly qualified: No information provided about your rights as a client, confidentiality, office policies, and fees (all of which would allow you to fairly consent to your therapy) No license issued by the state or jurisdiction in which they practice. A degree from a non-accredited institution. Unresolved complaints filed with their licensing board. The more information your therapist has about you, the better they will be able to do their job. Helpful documents might include reports from previous psychological tests or recent hospital discharge summaries. If you are a student, you may also want to bring recent grades or other recent markers of progress. This will be helpful during your intake interview, when the therapist may ask you to fill out forms about your current and past physical and emotional health. By streamlining this part of your visit, you and your therapist will have more opportunity to get to know each other on a person-to-person level. If you are already taking any medications for mental or physical health, or if you have recently stopped a medication, you will want to come prepared with the following information: Name of the drug(s) Your dosage Side effects you are experiencing Contact information of the providing doctor(s) When meeting for the first time, you may have lots of different questions and concerns. In order to address everything you want to know, write some notes reminding you to gather all the information you need. Bringing these to your first session will help you feel less confused and more at ease. Notes might include the following questions for your therapist: What therapeutic approach do you use? How will we define our goals? Will you expect me to complete assignments to do between sessions? How frequently will we meet? Will our work together be short-term or long-term? Are you willing to collaborate with my other health care providers to treat me more effectively? Because therapy is meant to provide you with a safe space to work on yourself, time must be managed wisely. Once you are in the session it's the therapist's job to keep track of time, allowing you to focus on answering questions and adjusting to the feel of therapy. But, it's up to you to get yourself to that point. Be aware that some private therapists charge for missed appointments, and these fees are not covered by insurance.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Who is causing more marine pollution? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Answer:","completion":"Considering the information provided and the hint about the primary sources and consequences of marine pollution, it can be concluded that Hilda is causing more marine pollution. The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river, which is next to Hilda's farm. Hilda has been regularly dumping excess fertilizer into this river since her childhood, a practice that eventually leads to an influx of potentially hazardous chemicals entering the ocean. Excessive nutrients from fertilizers can lead to an overgrowth of algae in the water, resulting in oxygen depletion and creating dead zones that are detrimental to aquatic life. In contrast, the Dundrin Ocean is connected to several rivers, which are mostly located in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. This suggests that the human impact on these rivers and, consequently, on the ocean is relatively minimal. Luke, who owns the only farm near the Dundrin Ocean, does not dispose of any garbage in the ocean or nearby rivers. Instead, he stores excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of it properly. By doing so, Luke ensures that he does not contribute to marine pollution in the Dundrin Ocean. In conclusion, Hilda's longstanding practice of dumping excess fertilizer into the river connected to the Malegese Ocean results in a higher level of marine pollution. Luke's responsible approach to waste management and commitment to storing or properly disposing of excess fertilizer significantly reduces his impact on the Dundrin Ocean's environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. In this task, you are given an input list. A list contains several comma-separated items written within brackets. You need to return the position of all the alphabetical elements in the given list in order. Assume the position of the 1st element to be 1. Return -1 if no alphabetical element is in the list. Q: ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'] A:","completion":"The task requires us to locate the positions of the alphabetical elements in a given list. The list consists of an assortment of values, separated by commas and enclosed by brackets. Guidelines for the task: 1. We are looking specifically for alphabetical elements, meaning letters of the alphabet. 2. We have to note their positions in the list. For this task, the position count starts at one for the first item. 3. If no alphabetical elements are located, we should return -1. 4. Lastly, we should preserve the order of the found positions. Applying these guidelines to find the answer: Given list is ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'] Step 1: Assess each element in the list in turn, starting with the first element. Step 2: Check if the current element is an alphabetical character. You can use the isalpha() function for this, which returns True if all the characters in the text are letters. Step 3: If the current element is an alphabetical character, note its position in the list. Remember that index counting starts from 1 in this task, so you need to add one to the actual index. Step 4: Move on to the next element and repeat steps 2 and 3 until all elements in the list have been processed. Step 5: If you find at least one alphabetical character, return the list of positions. If not, return -1. For the given list ['j', 'w', '6679', '3781', 'H', 'D'], the first character 'j' is an alphabetical character and it's at position 1, 'w' is at position 2, 'H' is at position 5, and 'D' is at position 6.

Background: Raymond William Stacy Burr was born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. His father, William Johnston Burr (1889-1985), was a hardware salesman; his mother, Minerva Annette (nee Smith, 1892-1974), was a pianist and music teacher who was born in Chicago, Illinois. Burr's ancestry included Lebanese, Irish, English, Scottish, and German. When Burr was six, his parents divorced. Context: Burr was a well-known philanthropist. He gave enormous sums of money, including his salaries from the Perry Mason movies, to charity. He was also known for sharing his wealth with friends. He sponsored 26 foster children through the Foster Parents' Plan or Save The Children, many with the greatest medical needs. He also gave money and some of his Perry Mason scripts to the McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California. Burr was an early supporter of the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Sanibel, Florida, raising funds and chairing its first capital campaign. He also donated a large collection of Fijian cowries and cones from his island in Fiji. In 1993, Sonoma State University awarded Burr an honorary doctorate. He supported medical and education institutions in Denver, and in 1993, the University of Colorado awarded him an honorary doctorate for his acting work. Burr also founded and financed the American Fijian Foundation that funded academic research, including efforts to develop a dictionary of the language. Burr made repeated trips on behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffinland, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, \\"My only position on the war is that I wish it were over.\\" In October 1967, NBC aired Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. \\"The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing\\", wrote the Chicago Tribune; the Los Angeles Times called Burr's questions \\"intelligent and elicited some interesting replies\\". Burr had a reputation in Hollywood as a thoughtful, generous man years before much of his more-visible philanthropic work. In 1960, Ray Collins, who portrayed Lt. Arthur Tragg on the original Perry Mason series, and who was by that time often ill and unable to remember all the lines he was supposed to speak, stated, \\"There is nothing but kindness from our star, Ray Burr. Part of his life is dedicated to us, and that's no bull. If there's anything the matter with any of us, he comes around before anyone else and does what he can to help.

Choices: - problems - crying - inspiration - trauma - nightmares The rationale to choose \\"inspiration\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"Remembering past successes is likely to cause inspiration. The rationale for choosing \\"inspiration\\" as the answer is based on the following points: 1. Positive reinforcement: Remembering past successes often serves as a form of positive reinforcement, reminding individuals of their capabilities and achievements. This positive reinforcement can motivate and inspire people to continue pursuing their goals, take on new challenges, and believe in their abilities to overcome obstacles and achieve success. 2. Confidence booster: Reflecting on past accomplishments can boost confidence, as it helps individuals to realize their potential and feel more competent. This increased confidence, in turn, can inspire them to take on greater challenges and strive for better results in the future. 3. Learning from experience: By recalling past successes, individuals can analyze their previous strategies and actions that contributed to these particular achievements. This analysis can provide valuable insight into which approaches worked and which ones didn't, allowing individuals to refine their strategies moving forward. As a result, these individuals may feel inspired to apply the lessons they have learned in future endeavors. 4. Maintaining motivation: Remembering past successes can help individuals to maintain motivation in the face of challenges, setbacks, or failures. By focusing on past achievements, people can remind themselves of their worth and capabilities, leading them to feel inspired to persevere through difficult situations and continue striving for success. 5. Emotional wellness: Recalling past successes can not only provide inspiration, but also contribute to emotional well-being. By focusing on positive memories and experiences, individuals can foster feelings of pride, happiness, and gratitude, which can promote mental health and resilience. In summary, remembering past successes is likely to cause inspiration, as it reinforces positive beliefs about one's abilities, boosts confidence, aids in learning from past experiences, and helps maintain motivation and emotional wellness. The other choices (problems, crying, trauma, and nightmares) don't fit the context as well, as they are more likely to be triggered by negative experiences rather than successes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a special box that helps you to keep track of where your ships are, and where your friends' ships might be hiding. 2. Make sure all the ship pieces are there: Before we can start playing, we need to check that everyone has all their ship pieces. There are different kinds of ships like big ones, small ones, and some in between. Each player must have the same number of ship pieces to make it a fair game. 3. It's time to secretly arrange your ships: Now comes the exciting part! Each player gets to put their ship pieces on their own battleship box, but you must do it in secret so that the other players can't see.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

Answer:","completion":"While \\"get yelled at\\" could be a possible outcome for Alex in this scenario, it is important to consider various factors and potential consequences that Alex may face due to the imbalanced relationship with Ash. To provide a more detailed and elaborate answer, we must consider different aspects, including emotional, social, and psychological effects. 1. Emotional Consequences: Alex might experience emotional distress and become resentful due to Ash's exploitation. This emotional turmoil may manifest as feelings of inadequacy, rejection, or helplessness, particularly if Alex valued their relationship with Ash. Moreover, state of continuous giving without receiving might lead to disappointment, sadness, and lowered self-esteem. 2. Social Effects: Unbalanced relationships could lead to a negative reputation for both parties involved. Other people may perceive Ash as manipulative, selfish, or untrustworthy, while Alex might be seen as naive, over-accommodating, or a pushover. This perception could affect both of their social interactions and may potentially harm their relationship with other mutual friends. 3. Psychological Impact: In the long run, this continuous exploitation might lead to Alex developing negative coping mechanisms, such as a lack of trust or agoraphobic tendencies, to avoid being taken advantage of by others. Additionally, Alex could experience heightened anxiety, depression, or feelings of emptiness as a result of being exploited by someone they considered a friend. 4. Alternative Actions: Instead of just \\"getting yelled at,\\" Alex could choose to take various courses of action. They may decide to confront Ash about the imbalance in their relationship, set boundaries to protect themselves from further exploitation, or even end the relationship as a whole. If Alex decides to maintain their friendship with Ash, they might want to engage in open and honest communication, ensuring that both parties understand the implications of their actions and work towards establishing a more balanced relationship. In conclusion, while \\"getting yelled at\\" could be a potential outcome for Alex regarding their situation with Ash, it is essential to consider various other emotional, social, and psychological consequences that may arise. Additionally, how Alex chooses to address this issue might significantly impact the outcome of the situation. Thus, it is crucial to look at the entire context and possible actions when determining the consequences Alex may face."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(I) Erin was scared of rodents.; (II) Rachel was scared of rodents.;","completion":"Erin liked holding the hamster more than Rachel did because Rachel was scared of rodents. While both Erin and Rachel were close friends who enjoyed trying out new experiences together, their preference for handling small animals like hamsters varied greatly. Erin, an adventurous and curious individual, always found herself drawn to animals and loved understanding their unique characteristics. She enjoyed observing how they interacted with their surroundings and watching their quirky movements. Over time, Erin grew extremely fond of rodents, especially hamsters, considering them to be fascinating creatures. She cherished the moments she spent holding the hamster, feeling a strong connection to the tiny animal that seemed to trust her. Erin's experience with hamsters transcended the general fondness though; she was knowledgeable about these small animals and was well-versed in their dietary needs and living conditions. She could distinguish between the many different species of hamsters and even gauge their emotional state through a keen observation of their behavior. On the other hand, Rachel was terrified of rodents, including hamsters. Rachel's fear of rodents stemmed from a negative childhood experience. As a young girl, she encountered a family of rats in her home, leaving her with a lasting impression of disgust and alarm. Despite being aware that hamsters were not harmful in any way, Rachel could not shake off her aversion to rodents in general. The mere sight of Erin holding the hamster made Rachel feel anxious and uncomfortable. Rachel's fear of rodents put her in a difficult position, knowing that Erin was genuinely passionate about hamsters and their well-being. Their friendship, however, was strong enough for Rachel to face her fear and provide moral support to Erin whenever needed. Rachel respected Erin's enthusiasm and made an effort to learn about hamsters and understand them better. As time went by, her feelings of uneasiness around Erin's hamster began to diminish marginally, although she still preferred not to hold them herself. Despite their differing feelings on rodents, Erin and Rachel continued to enjoy their friendship while pursuing their unique interests. Erin's love and fascination for hamsters never faded, and she continued to learn more about these animals, hoping to one day have her own pet hamster. Rachel, on the other hand, started taking gentle steps toward overcoming her fear of rodents, realizing that her friendship with Erin was more important than the discomfort she experienced around hamsters. In conclusion, Erin liked holding the hamster more than Rachel did because Rachel was scared of rodents. Their distinct attitudes toward hamsters did not impact their friendship negatively but rather taught them to respect and understand each other's preferences. This experience allowed them both to grow as individuals and build an even stronger bond between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noye's Fludde and have been pen pals since then. Their relationship having become romantic over the course of their correspondence, they have made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, and Suzy brings her binoculars, six books, her kitten, and her brother's battery-powered record player.

We can do this by following these steps: 1.

Calculate the combined result of the constants on the right-hand side. -618*b = 2937*b - 10665 3. Eliminate the 'b' term on the right-hand side by adding 618*b to both sides. -618*b + 618*b = 2937*b - 10665 + 618*b 4. Calculate the combined b terms. 0 = 3555*b - 10665 5.

Can we infer the following?

Although it's inferred that an order was given on September 12th, the text doesn't provide explicit details about what that order entailed or who the recipient(s) of this order were. The speaker does mention their apparent expectation to review an 'accumulated list of questions that were objected to' during their break. And considering the fact that reporters appeared for depositions, we might infer that the speaker has some supervisory role; likely in a legal setting, given the use of terminology such as 'depositions' and 'rule on those questions'. However, while this suggests some level of authority and responsibility, we can't definitely infer that the speaker provided clear orders to their subordinates on September 12th. This conclusion would be presumption rather than a direct inference, as the text doesn't directly attribute any instructions or directives to be issued by the speaker to subordinates on that specified date. The flow of information within the text suggests that the speaker expected a certain course of action based on previous communication, but it doesn't provide explicit evidence to conclude that an order was given to subordinate personnel. It would be more accurate to infer that some kind of directive or expectation was communicated, and the speaker assumed a particular outcome, but the specifics of that communication remain unclear based on the details given. The uncertainty underlines the importance of clear and direct communication in a professional setting, especially when dealing with procedural matters such as objections and rulings. Misinterpretation or miscommunication can lead to confusion and unmet expectations, as seemingly indicated by the speaker's surprise and disapproval of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight. Answer this question please: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step. 1.

Article: In eighth grade, I decided to try out for my school musical. I only made it through the first verse before the drama teacher stopped me. It goes without saying that my Christmas song didn't get me any role. Am I embarrassed? NO. Not just because it was ten years ago, but also because it's such a great story to share. Why? I think the main reason is that admitting mistakes makes you easier to relate to. Interestingly enough, science confirms _ . Researchers have conducted many studies and have concluded that when someone makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way, they are found to be more likeable. In other words, if you're able to do well and then you mess up, it shows your human side. This allows others to connect and relate to you, which in turn makes them like you more. Growing up, I was type of student who had to get straight A's and the type of athlete who always had to perform at the top of the game. The problem was that my standards were so ridiculously high that I was never happy. It was only when I learned to let go and forgive myself for my mistakes that I truly felt relaxed. When one of your close friends or family members makes a mistake, are you quick to forgive and forget? Sadly, many of us often express more sympathy for others than ourselves. With each mistake coming a lesson, you will be better equipped to handle life's challenges going forward. More importantly, if you are always worried about looking silly, you will never be able to get improved. Even if you make a fool of yourself, it isn't the end of the world.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who was the last president that was not a democrat or republican?","completion":"The last President of the United States who was not affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican party was Millard Fillmore, the 13th President, who served from 1850 to 1853. Fillmore was a member of the Whig Party when he assumed office following the death of President Zachary Taylor. The Whig Party was one of the dominant political forces in American politics from the early 1830s to the mid-1850s. The party was formed in opposition to the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. In particular, the Whigs supported the supremacy of Congress over the Executive Branch and favored a program of modernization and economic protectionism. Fillmore, originally a lawyer from New York, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1833 to 1843 and was a strong opponent of Andrew Jackson. In 1848, he was elected as Vice President under Zachary Taylor, the 12th President, who was also a member of the Whig Party. However, Taylor died in office on July 9, 1850, and Fillmore assumed the presidency. During his presidency, Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850 in an attempt to avoid a potential civil war between the North and the South over the issue of slavery. The Compromise was a package of five separate bills passed by U.S. Congress that defused a political confrontation between slave and free states. However, the compromise was fragile and was one of the contributing factors to the eventual Civil War. After his presidency ended in 1853, Fillmore still continued his political career and in 1856, he was nominated for the Presidency by the Know-Nothing Party, more officially known as the American Party, but he did not win the election. So, to sum up, the last U.S. President who was not a Democrat or a Republican was Millard Fillmore. His presidency marked the end of an era as the Whigs fell into disarray and ultimately dissolved in the late 1850s due to divisions over slavery. The Republican Party would be formed in 1854 from the remnants of the Whig Party and others who opposed slavery, leading to the two-party system we know today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If your friend or partner is often reaching out to talk, he probably misses you when you're not around. Everyone has different styles around communication, but frequent phone calls and messages are a good sign of investment in a relationship. When someone misses you, he will sound engaged and eager when you do speak. If your friend sounds distracted when you're catching up after a long time, it may be a sign that he didn't miss you. If you feel anxious or insecure when your partner is away, it's better to be honest about it. Asking, “Did you miss me?” or “Do you still love me?” is unlikely to address your real feelings. If your partner says, “Yes,” you might not believe her, while if she says, “No,” you'll feel even worse. Instead, ask directly for the reassurance that you need. For example, you could say: “I've had a terrible day and I'm feeling pretty lonely and insecure tonight. Can you indulge me with some extra support and tell me that you love me and miss me?” If your friend or partner shares images or links that made her think of you, it means just that: she's thinking of you. When you are not together, you are still in your friend's mind. Presents are another way of demonstrating caring and engagement. Even if you don't always love the thing a friend or partner got you, recognize that this, too, is evidence that she was thinking about you when you were not together. If he is eager to tell you about the details of his boring conference or flight connections, recognize that it's probably because he wants to keep talking to you. Sharing mundane details is a way of maintaining connection across distance and shows that he misses you when you are apart. If you are far apart, it may be harder to read the signs of affection in your partner's body. If you can talk by video, look for a tilted head and sustained eye-contact. Over the phone, a softer or higher tone of voice conveys intimacy. Pair bonding between couples means that separation can cause increased stress and anxiety. If she is especially worried or unsettled while you are apart, it may be that she is missing you.

First, we add up all the numbers on the right side of the equation. So, -31*z - 172 - 27 - 235 all together equals -31*z - 434. So our equation becomes: 0 = -31*z - 434. Then, to find 'z', we need to move all the stuff that's not 'z' to the other side of the equation. To do that, we add 434 to both sides, like taking 434 cookies from one side and putting them on the other. This gives us: 434 = -31*z. But we still have that '-31' glued to our 'z'. Since it's multiplication (think of it like -31 groups of z), we do the opposite to get rid of it, which is division. So, we divide both sides by -31 like splitting the cookies into 31 equal groups. That gives us: z = 434 / -31. And finally, when we do that math, we find that z = -14. For a little extra fun, imagine if you had 14 pieces of candy and then you lost all of them!

I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day).

The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music. - Holy Moses is a German thrash metal band. They are well noted for being fronted by Sabina Classen (it is rare for a woman to be a singer in thrash metal) and for being one of the very first German thrash metal bands. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany. The band is a pioneering force in the power metal genre, and their second and third studio albums, \\"\\" and \\"\\", are considered masterpieces of the genre. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Sabina Classen (born December 27, 1963 in Aachen as Sabina Hirtz) is a German thrash metal singer, most known as lead vocalist of Holy Moses and Temple of the Absurd. - Ulrich Kusch ( born 11 March 1967 ) is a heavy metal drummer .

He is also known for his technical style of playing , fast - paced speed metal - like rhythm , and capable songwriting abilities .

Knowing that he is dying, he sets out with a stolen quantity of PU 239, a weapons grade form of radioactive material.To attempt to make something meaningful come out of the certain end of his life, he sets out for Moscow, where he incompetently attempts to sell the lethal material to who ever can read his hand-held sign, which simply says \\"PU 239.\\" To the civilized mind this scene is more remnicient of the American Wild West than a modern scene in a country as developed as Russia. To sell radioactive material, you just write the product name on a sign and hold it out for everyone on the street to observe? The protagonist does so as innocently as if he were selling vegtables at a roadside stand. As the plot races on, one gets the opinion that Russia IS the Wild west. Life is cheap, very cheap!With that first clumsy attempt at converting the material to cash for his family (wife and young son), he collides with an unimaginative street hood. Together, the dying man, and the incompetent criminal approach multiple other criminals with the offer to make them rich. However, the Biblical warning \\"there is no honor among thieves\\" plays out as the thugs eventually kill first the hood that \\"represents\\" him, and then he, himself.The bullet from the Moscow criminal did not truly kill him, however. The truth is that he was dead from the inception of the story. The product is death on wheels. In the movie, it is referred to as having a 40,000 year half life. Be this as it may, it is not nose candy. However, reaping what he sowed, the man that shot the dying man to death, then stupidly, snorts from the vile, and the story soon ends.

So I'm not surprised that my students worry about them, too, even though they usually don't need to. Because they are afraid of failing. However, since it is hard not to worry at all, we all must try not to worry too much. Why? Because worrying makes exams worse! How to do this? Ask the teacher about how to revise and about exam skills--how to work when you are in the exam. Good students don't wait until the week before an exam. They study all through the year. It is not possible to learn everything at the last minute. So don't leave it till then. If you start planning and working for each exam early and you make sure that you understand what you're studying, then, when it is over, you'll be able to say, \\"What a good exam that was!\\" Take a short rest during your time of work and revision. If your mind is tired, it won't remember well. Work at the time when you know you'll work at your best. If you're studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed afterwards. Your mind will still be \\"going round and round\\"--thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you think of other things. If you feel bad, talk to someone about your worries. But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes you work hard for them.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: :::SPOILER ALERT::: Soooo, Arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp). He escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys. I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie-fan and all. However, \\"The Running Man\\" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats. There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns. The acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance.

Q:Process: - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more finish stays on happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed suggests that if more finish stays on the wood, there would be less or slower weathering occurring. In order to understand the potential effects this change could have on the process, let's break down the steps of the weathering process and explore the impact of the perturbation on each step. 1. Rain falls on wood: Whether more finish stays on the wood or not, rain would still fall on the surface. The perturbation does not directly affect this step. 2. The rain seeps into the wood surface: With more finish staying on the wood, it is more likely that the surface becomes better protected and less porous. As a result, the rain may have more difficulty seeping into the wood surface, which could slow down or reduce the overall weathering process. 3. It permeates the wood: If less rain seeps into the wood surface due to the remaining finish, then the wood has more protection from water damage, leading to slower permeation rates and subsequently less damage. 4. When rain evaporates it leaves the wood: The evaporation process occurs regardless of the finish, but with more finish staying on the wood, it is possible that the rate of evaporation might be slightly altered or reduced. 5. It takes the finish of the wood with it: If more finish stays on the wood, the rate at which the finish deteriorates would decrease. This means the wood would maintain its protective barrier longer, which indirectly contributes to less weathering occurring. 6. The wood begins to lose its luster: As more finish stays on the wood, its protective qualities are prolonged, slowing down the rate at which the wood loses its luster. 7. It begins to look bad: If the wood maintains its finish and luster for a more extended period, its overall appearance would be preserved, contributing to a slower degradation process. 8. It has pieces of paint missing from the rain: Again, with more finish staying on the wood, less paint would be lost due to rain, reducing the rate of weathering. 9. It gets worse when it rains: Since the wood is better protected by the remaining finish, it would not be as susceptible to rapid deterioration when rain occurs. 10. It eventually will have no paint left: Although the perturbation hypothesis slows down the weathering process, the finish will still continue to wear away over time, exposing the paint and wood to environmental factors. However, this would happen at a much slower rate than without the proposed perturbation. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more finish staying on the wood has a direct and indirect effect on the weathering process, mainly through a prolonged protective barrier provided by the finish. This results in slower degradation, allowing the wood to maintain its luster and appearance for a more extended period. However, it does not completely prevent environmental wear and tear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

However, the training methods employed might surprise some, as the USAF utilizes older aircraft to train pilots for state-of-the-art fighter jets such as the F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor. This article delves into the reasons and advantages behind employing older planes in training today's elite pilots. Training Process When it comes to training the best pilots in the world, hands-on experience is critical. Before recruits take their first flight in an advanced fighter jet, they must complete rigorous training programs in progressively more sophisticated aircraft. The first step is the T-6 Texan II, a single-engine turboprop aircraft, followed by the T-38 Talon, a supersonic jet trainer that has been in use since the 1960s. These older planes serve as a foundation for introducing students to high-speed flight and developing their skills as pilots. Advantages of Utilizing Older Planes While it may seem counterintuitive, there are numerous advantages to employing older planes for training purposes. 1. Cost-Effectiveness: Maintaining and operating older aircraft are significantly more affordable than their modern counterparts. With a growing defense budget, it is important to conserve resources where possible. Using older planes saves on costs that can be allocated to other crucial areas within the defense sector. 2. Gradual Progression: The complexity of modern fighter jets could be overwhelming for inexperienced pilots. Older planes ensure that pilots have a strong foundational understanding of flight mechanics before advancing to more technologically advanced aircraft. By mastering the skills and techniques required to fly older models, they can translate their knowledge into effectively handling state-of-the-art jets. 3. Reliability and Durability: Many older aircraft, such as the T-38 Talon, have proven their reliability over decades of service. These planes have undergone countless modifications and upgrades, making them more rugged and dependable. As a result, they remain an excellent choice for preparing pilots for the strenuous demands of advanced combat missions. 4. Enhanced Training: Older planes may lack the sophisticated avionics and weapon systems found in newer fighters, but they allow pilots to hone their basic flying skills. This hands-on experience gives pilots the ability to quickly adapt to new situations and maintain focus under pressure, which is essential when operating modern fighter jets. Challenges and Solutions Despite the advantages of using older planes in training, there are some challenges that the USAF must overcome. These include maintaining and modernizing older aircraft, as well as ensuring that pilots receive adequate training on the advanced systems found in modern fighters. To address these concerns, the USAF has introduced simulators to supplement hands-on training with older planes. These simulators mimic the cockpit and systems of advanced fighter jets like the F-35 and F-22. Combining simulator training with experience in older, more basic aircraft allows pilots to gain a comprehensive understanding of the systems and techniques unique to modern fighters. Conclusion The United States Air Force continues to train its pilots for the most advanced fighter jets by using older planes in combination with cutting-edge simulation technology. This balance of learning in an older and simpler platform, along with high-tech simulators, prepares pilots for the rigors and demands of operating state-of-the-art aircraft. Furthermore, training with older planes offers cost-effective advantages, as well as invaluable hands-on learning experiences. In the end, this blend of tried-and-true methods and modern innovation ensures that the USAF maintains its reputation for excellence as its pilots continue to master the skies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success.

We have this math problem: -495 = -15*p + 55*p + 5*p First, let's add all the p's together. Think of it like this: you have -15 apples, then someone gives you 55 apples, and then you get 5 more apples. To find out how many apples you have in total, you add all the apples together: (-15 * p) + (55 * p) + (5 * p) -15 apples + 55 apples + 5 apples = 40 apples + 5 apples = 45 apples So, if we rewrite the equation, we get: -495 = 45*p Now, let's find out how many times 45 should be multiplied to get -495. In other words, we'll divide -495 by 45: -495 ÷ 45 = -11 So, if you take the number 45 and multiply it by -11, you get -495. That means p equals -11.

London topped the list for rides and runs with over 10 million activities logged in the last year. \\"We've analysed billions of GPS data points and millions of activities to give a never-seen-before insight,\\" said Strava co-founder Davis Kitchel. The \\"Strava Insights\\" project revealed that nearly 10,000 bike or run commutes - journeys within the morning and evening rush-hour windows - are logged in London every day, four times as many as San Francisco and Amsterdam, the cities second and third respectively on the commutes list. However, London's population is about 10 times the size of those two bike-friendly cities, although London's numbers do compare well to cities of similar sizes, such as New York, Sydney, Berlin and Paris. Analysis of all logged activities show Tuesday is the most popular day for a bike ride in every city apart from Sao Paulo (Wednesday). According to the results, Amsterdam residents ride the fastest (15.9 miles per hour on average), those in Milan cycle the furthest (33.7 miles) and Parisians run the fastest (eight minutes 56 seconds per mile). The figures also show that users in Sydney ride or run the earliest, Sao Paolo residents exercise latest, and those in Barcelona have the toughest terrain to contend with. Strava, which was launched in 2009, uses global-positioning-satellite technology to record rides and runs, allowing users to compare their performances against other users. The San Francisco-based company does not reveal its total membership but claims it is growing by 100,000 new users every week.

Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he \\"could not sleep and was nervous.\\" Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers. The shells going over him bothered him. The next day he was worried about his buddy and became more nervous. He was sent down to the rear echelon by a battery aid man and there the medical aid man gave him some medicine which made him sleep, but still he was nervous and disturbed. On the next day the medical officer ordered him to be evacuated, although the boy begged not to be evacuated because he did not want to leave his unit. On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. \\"It's my nerves,\\" Bennett responded. \\"I can't stand the shelling anymore.\\" Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: \\"Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying.\\" Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, \\"You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight.

The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company.

I heard that Remy posted flyers to the event they were going to put on. And I was wondering Why did Remy do this?","completion":"To determine why Remy posted flyers for the event, I will gather information and consider possible reasons. Here are my steps: Step 1: Analyze the purpose of flyers Flyers can be a powerful and cost-effective form of advertising, promoting a cause or an event to a wide audience. They are tangible forms of communication and support engagement with the target audience. Step 2: Identify the event in question I need to know the details of Remy's event to understand the reasons behind using flyers for promotion. The event might be a party, concert, community gathering, or workshop. Knowing the event type helps to understand Remy's goals and objectives, which are essential for finding the reason. Step 3: Understand Remy's objectives I will consider Remy's possible objectives. They might want to raise awareness, attract attendees, build a community, or seek donations. By aligning these objectives with the benefits of using flyers, I can better understand why they chose this method. Step 4: Identify Remy's target audience Remy might choose to use flyers to reach specific demographics or areas. By analyzing the target audience, I can conclude if posting flyers makes sense in that context. Step 5: Consider alternatives Before concluding, I will consider if Remy had alternative promotional options like social media, email, or online advertising and why they chose flyers instead. After completing these steps, I can make a well-informed assumption about why Remy posted flyers for their event: Remy likely chose to use flyers because of their cost-effectiveness and the ability to reach a wide audience in a tangible manner. The event may be a local one, making physical advertising more suitable than digital methods. Alternatively, Remy might want to target specific demographics or neighborhoods that would be best reached by distributing flyers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: – Danny Pintauro, who played Jonathan on Who's the Boss?, revealed a big secret when he went on Oprah Winfrey's Oprah: Where Are They Now? \\"I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but I wasn't ready—I'm ready now—that I'm HIV-positive, and I have been for 12 years,\\" said Pintauro, 39, per the Hollywood Reporter. The former child star came out as gay in 1997. \\"It's just a big deal,\\" he said of his diagnosis. \\"It's not something that people are talking about right now really,\\" and he hopes to be a role model for others with HIV. (Pintauro got married last year.)","completion":"Title: Danny Pintauro: Breaking Stereotypes and Living with HIV Danny Pintauro, famously known for his role as Jonathan on the hit sitcom \\"Who’s the Boss?\\", gave the world a surprising and deep revelation when he appeared on Oprah’s show titled \\"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\\". Confessing a long-kept secret, the one-time child actor revealed, \\"I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but I wasn’t ready—I'm ready now—that I'm HIV-positive, and I have been for 12 years.\\" Born on January 6, 1976, Pintauro first garnered fame in the late 1980s through his role in “Who’s the Boss?”. A versatile actor at a young age, he carried his talent forward in TV and film, capturing audiences with his boyish charm and impressive acting skills. However, the news he shared on Oprah's show offered a glimpse into the more profound struggles that the now 39-year-old actor has had to face. Per the Hollywood Reporter, Pintauro, who first acknowledged his sexual orientation to the public back in 1997, revealed that he has been living with HIV for over a decade. While this news may have initially raised eyebrows, it also served to underscore the critical elements of living with HIV: maintaining personal strength and battling social stigmas. Given the often misconstrued and sensationalized image of HIV and AIDS in media and public discourse, Pintauro’s confession was received as a brave move. He captured the complex emotions associated with his health status when he stated, \\"It's just a big deal.\\" He further acknowledged that even though people might not be explicitly discussing HIV at the moment, it remains a significant health issue globally. What Pintauro hopes to achieve through revealing his diagnosis represents another facet of his courage. Instead of shying away from the implications of his health condition, he wants to use his status as a public figure to shed light on HIV, to diffuse the stigma surrounding it, and to support those similarly affected. By harnessing his fame and exposure, Pintauro aspires to be a role model for others in the same situation. He further strives to show that being HIV-positive does not imply a ‘death sentence’, but instead, it means living a life encompassing diligence, safety precautions, and advanced medical care. Pintauro’s life hasn't stopped with his HIV diagnosis. On the contrary, he's been living a wholesome life and even got married the year before his big revelation. This shows that the former child star is not allowing his diagnosis to define him, but rather, he's thriving, striving, and living his life to the fullest despite it. His story thus serves as a powerful source of inspiration for others. It is indicative of the fact that while HIV is a life-altering condition, it does not have to dictate the course of one's life. In conclusion, Danny Pintauro's brave admission about being HIV positive has initiated significant dialogue about the condition and its associated stigmas. It's a testament to Pintauro’s resilience that he has taken a potentially limiting condition and transformed it into a platform for educating others, for empowerment, and for inspiring hope among many. He is indeed a modern warrior fighting against the societal prejudices surrounding HIV and an inspiration for those living with the condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, the reviewer mentions two negative factors: one, that the Bear Family CD is cheaper - the implication is that the current product is overpriced or at least not cost-effective compared to other options. Secondly, the reviewer calls out the lack of stereo sound on the CD, stating, \\"There is no reason for this mono transfer.\\" They put this as another significant downside since the album was recorded in a time when stereo was at its peak, indicating that the product is not meeting the expected standards.

Here's what we have: -90 * w + 482 = -2085 - 673 First, let's add 2085 and 673, the big and small negative numbers, or as I like to call them, the grumpy numbers! -2085 - 673 = -2758 Now our problem looks like this: -90 * w + 482 = -2758 Next, let's make sure our grumpy number (-2758) is by itself. We'll do that by moving the happy number (+482) to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 482 from both sides: -2758 - 482 = -3240 So, now we have: -90 * w = -3240 Now, we just need to find out what w is. We will do that by dividing both sides by the number attached to w, which is -90. Remember, when you divide two grumpy numbers (-90 and -3240), you get a happy number! -3240 / -90 = 36 So, our answer is: w = 36 Good job, little buddy!

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Options: A: doesn't like snow B: wants to take his car out of the garage C: wants to keep the road clean D: often tells the man to do something A:","completion":"The correct answer is \\"B: wants to take his car out of the garage\\". As per the context provided in the article, Mr. Smith approached a man to clean the road from his garage to the gate. This action was motivated by Mr. Smith's intention of taking his car out, and not simply due to an aversion to snow or a desire to keep a clean road. The text doesn't indicate that Mr. Smith often tells men to do something, ruling out option D. Hence, it can be inferred that the reasoning behind his request to the man was driven by his need to use his car and ensure it wasn't inhibited by the accumulated snow blocking the pathway from his garage to the gate. Therefore, upon analyzing the information provided in the article, it is evident that Mr. Smith instructed the man to clear the road from his garage to the gate as he desired to use his car, i.e., he wanted to take his car out of the garage.

Given the question: Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. and the situation: Two pedologists studied different types of soil.

Drudge, who is largely supportive of the president, added that Senate Democrats had floated such an idea before Trump was president. ADVERTISEMENT Trump was referencing a recent report from the politically conservative Media Research Center that found 91 percent of “evaluative” statements made on the three main nightly newscasts from June to August of last year about Trump were negative. The president has often gone after the media for what he views as unfair coverage that he has deemed “fake news” and talked about taking retaliatory measures against journalists. In the past, he has floated canceling the daily press briefings and threatened to change libel laws so that when journalists write “purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” Last year it was reported that Trump had urged former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyGrassley wants to subpoena Comey, Lynch after critical IG report The media just can't stop lying about Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report — Sponsored by Delta Air Lines – First lady makes surprise visit to migrant children at border MORE to imprison journalists that published classified information. ||||| The White House Correspondents' Association fired back at President Trump Donald John TrumpDem Senator: Trump's next Supreme Court nominee would overturn Roe v.

Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 9, 2018 Trump has long directed his ire at the news media, and has floated ideas such as canceling the daily press briefings at the White House and opening up libel laws to make it easier to sue news outlets and reporters. Taking away press credentials, however, would be unprecedented and would drastically restrict correspondents' access to the White House grounds and press briefings, among other things. The White House Correspondents' Association itself came under fire late last month after Talev issued a statement denouncing comedian Michelle Wolf's performance at the annual White House correspondents' dinner. Critics, including many journalists, accused the organization of hypocrisy for criticizing the comedian while claiming to defend free speech. ||||| The liberal media’s war against President Trump was as fierce as ever during the first four months of 2018, but the onslaught appears to be for naught: In the face of massive and hostile coverage from ABC, CBS and NBC, Trump’s overall job approval rating actually rose, from 37 percent in mid-December to roughly 43 percent at the end of April. The Media Research Center studied all broadcast evening news coverage of the President from January 1 through April 30, and found 90 percent of the evaluative comments about Trump were negative — precisely the same hostile tone we documented in 2017. But unlike last year, when the RealClearPolitics average depicted a slow but steady erosion in the President’s job approval numbers, the public has apparently warmed to Trump in 2018, even as the networks are as frosty as ever. For this report, MRC analysts examined all 1,065 network evening news stories about President Trump and top members of his administration during the first four months of this year. The coverage totalled a whopping 1,774 minutes, or roughly one-third of all evening news airtime. (For comparison, in 2015 and 2016, coverage of President Obama amounted to just ten percent of all evening news airtime.) Nearly two-fifths (39%) of the TV coverage we examined focused on Trump scandals and controversies, while 45 percent was devoted to various policy issues. The remaining airtime was spent on controversies involving other top Trump officials, such as EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, or did not involve specific topics. The Russia “collusion” story was given by far the most airtime — 321 minutes, or nearly one-fifth of all Trump administration coverage. The legal battle involving porn star Stormy Daniels, as well as allegations against the President involving other women, ate up another 92 minutes of airtime. Network coverage of those topics, plus a host of other smaller controversies involving the President, was almost entirely negative: of the 598 statements we tallied about Trump’s personal controversies or scandals, virtually all of them (579, or 97%) were negative. (As always, our analysis of “spin” tracks only explicitly positive and negative statements from reporters and non-partisan sources; it excludes neutral statements as well as statements from partisans such as Trump praising himself or Democrats criticizing him.) When it came to policy matters, the President fared somewhat better — but only in contrast. Of the 542 opinionated statements involving a policy matter, 440 (81%) were negative, compared with 102 (19%) which were positive. The policy stories earning the most TV airtime in 2018 were immigration (167 minutes), the economy (117 minutes), North Korea (111 minutes), Syria (89 minutes) and gun rights (57 minutes). The networks’ spin on immigration, Syria and gun rights was extremely negative (between 88% and 96% negative). And, despite the potential of a breakthrough with North Korea, the coverage of that topic was tilted two-to-one against the President (68% negative vs. 32% positive). The President’s handling of the economy was a mixed bag. A majority of the networks’ airtime (66 minutes) was devoted to Trump’s decision to impose tariffs and threaten a wider trade war with nations such as China, an aspect of economic policy which drew mostly criticism (90% negative spin). But the remaining airtime (51 minutes) consisted of mostly positive coverage (73% positive) for the rest of Trump’s economic agenda: job growth, tax reform, deregulation, and plans for more infrastructure spending. Yet this coverage has amounted to less than three percent of TV’s total coverage of the President this year. The positive economic story is probably one reason why the public has rewarded Trump with higher approval ratings, despite the bad press. Another is that the public’s trust in the media has been eroding for years, which means that journalists are less credible critics than they might have been years ago. There’s no precedent for a President receiving such a sustained level of negative press over such a long period of time. The fact that the public has become more favorable towards the President in this environment is the latest sign that the media watchdog’s bite isn’t as menacing as their bark suggests. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Take the hand you want to make the peace sign with, and hold it in front of you, open palmed, with your palm facing away from your body. Rake your fingers, excluding your pointer and middle finger, and fold them into your palm like you are making a fist. Make sure your thumb is over your other fingers. Raise your index and middle fingers. The index finger is the closest finger to your thumb. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. This is how you make the standard peace sign with your hand, Your extended index and middle fingers should form a “V.” Keep your clenched fingers and palm pointed away from your body. This is very important. When you keep your palm facing inward toward yourself, the gesture can be perceived as offensive in some cultures, almost a double middle finger. Make sure you put your pointer finger and your middle finger out at the same time. If you put your middle finger out first it can mean something very bad in English (and in many other languages). Don't stick out your little finger; this, too, has an alternate, obscene interpretation. When done correctly, the peace sign became a counter-cultural symbol of peace in the Vietnam War. Most people raise their hand in the air while making it. Some people consider the meaning of the symbol to be a call for an end to war, and some people think of it as a general call for peace in the world. Some politicians have made the sign with both hands while raising both arms (Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower). This can be a cliche, though, that brings to mind Nixon. Many people just raise one arm when making the sign. When some people see the peace sign, they think of it as a “V” sign that means victory, especially in war. The V sign is also made by holding up the two fingers closest to the thumb in a V formation. It doesn’t matter which hand you use. Allied troops started using this hand sign to indicate victory during World War II. Winston Churchill used the sign to indicate victory. So did Nixon, in the context of Vietnam. Protesters who were against Vietnam then started using the same sign and saying “peace” as they did it instead, to protest the war. They wanted to change the hand gesture to a symbol of peace. The point is to be aware that the hand signal has both a history in the anti-war movement and in representing victory during war. This sign is another hand signal that derived from the television show, Star Trek. Its meaning is “live long and prosper.” To make it, press together the two fingers closest to your thumb at the same time you press together the two fingers farthest away from your thumb. The middle of your hand will form the “V” shape when you do this with your fingers. You should keep your thumb extended outward as you do so. Historically, the Vulcan was a pagan deity, a sun god who was linked to powerful energy such as thunderbolts. Summary:","completion":"To make the standard peace sign with your hand, hold it open palmed facing away from your body, fold all fingers except the pointer and middle finger into your palm, and raise your index and middle fingers. The peace sign, with its origins in countercultural anti-war movements and World War II victory gestures, can be interpreted differently depending on the context and the way the palm is facing. In addition, there is another hand signal from the television show Star Trek that shares a similar \\"V\\" shape, representing \\"live long and prosper.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is Satan and commands him to stop the taxi, and also attempts to give him his wallet. Shocked to see his \\"Evil Master\\", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river. Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith, who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because \\"they screwed up\\"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday.

They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. \\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\" \\"Drink Good Wet Root Beer.\\" \\"Fill up with Pacific Gas. \\"Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of \\"You Need It!

Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless or daring, the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that.

Today, we're going to talk about a really fun and exciting part of a football game - scoring touchdowns! A touchdown happens when a player carries the football across the other team's goal line or catches it there. This scores points for their team and gets everybody cheering! Now, you want to know who scored the first touchdown of the game, right? To find this out, we would need to know which game you are asking about because there are soooo many football games happening all the time. Each game features two teams, and one of these teams will usually score the first touchdown. Sometimes, it could be a big strong player who runs really fast, or it could be someone who catches the ball while jumping super high! It's always fun to hear the crowd go wild when this happens. Here's what you can do to find out who scored the first touchdown of the game you are asking about: 1. Ask a grown-up who watched the game or knows about it, like your mom, dad, or big brother/sister. They might remember the player's name, or even better, they might tell you an exciting story about how it happened! 2. Look it up on the internet with the help of an adult. You can search for the names of the two teams that played and the date the game happened. This should give you some information about the game, including who scored the first touchdown. 3. Watch highlights from the game on TV or online. Watching video highlights is lots of fun because you get to see all the best parts of the game, including the first touchdown! Just ask a grown-up to help you find them and enjoy the action together. Remember, each football game is unique and different, and that's what makes them so exciting to watch. The player who scored the first touchdown in one game may not be the same in another game. But it's always fun to learn more about football and the amazing players who score those exciting touchdowns! I hope you find the answer you're looking for, and you get to see many amazing touchdowns in the future!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The building blocks of lipids are generally based on long hydrocarbon chains, linked to other molecules such as fatty acids and glycerol. Among the given choices, the most appropriate answer would be 'organic compounds,' as it aligns with the fact that lipids can contain other molecules as parts of their structure. These may include: 1. Fatty acids: The primary component of most lipids, they consist of long hydrocarbon chains with carboxyl groups at one end. They can be saturated (no double bonds) or unsaturated (one or more double bonds). 2. Glycerol: A three-carbon alcohol with three hydroxyl groups, it can form ester linkages with fatty acids to create triglycerides, the primary storage form of fats in living organisms. 3. Phosphate groups: In some lipids, a phosphate group can be attached to the glycerol backbone, forming the basis of phospholipids. These are critical components of cell membranes in living organisms. 4. Steroids: Another class of lipids, steroids have a unique four-fused ring structure in their molecular backbone.

Input: Paragraph: Several arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease with case-fatality rates in hospitalized individuals ranging from 15-30%. Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-a) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-a has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replicationdeficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-a, for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichindé virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-a, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.

They should be allowed to get bored to that they can develop their ability to be creative. Children are expected by their parents to be reading a textbook all the time. However, research shows that it may _ the development of their imagination, while boredom can give them opportunities to develop creativity. Boredom is often linked with loneliness, but a writer named Meera Syal said boredom had helped here in developing her mind. She told researchers about her childhood. Having few things todo, Syal often talked with her neighbors. She also tried to do things like learning to bake cakes. \\"But importantly, I Thought and wrote a lot, because I was bored,\\" Syal said. She kept a diary, filling here time with short stories and poems she made up. Grayson Perry, an artist, grew up in a family with little money. He enjoyed himself by making up stories, drawing pictures for his stories and reading many books in the library. Bored but free, he spent hours looking out of the window, watching the changing clouds and seasons. Perry filled up his free time with what he liked. He became creative, because he could think freely. Dr. Belton is an expert on the effects of emotions on learning. \\"Boredom could be an uncomfortable feeling,\\" she said. \\"But some young people cannot deal with that boredom creatively. So sometimes they may break a classroom window, or drive a car out for a mad race.\\" Usually, when children have nothing to do, they would turn on the TV, the computer, or the phone. Their time on these things has increased, yet they need to have time to think about their experiences through play or just watching the world around them. It is this kind of thinking that can inspire the imagination. On the other hand, the TV or phone may cut short the thinking process.

The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch.

We have a math problem here: -373*j + 397*j = -168 First, we need to solve for \\"j\\". That means we're going to find the value of \\"j\\" that makes this equation true.

Combine the terms with \\"j\\" in them: (-373 + 397) * j = -168 This is because we're adding two terms that both have 'j' in them. So we can combine the numbers and keep the 'j' as a common factor. 2. Calculate the sum of numbers: 24 * j = -168 When we add (-373) and 397, we get 24. So now we have 24 times \\"j\\" equals -168. 3. Divide by 24 on both sides: j = -168 / 24 4. Calculate the result: j = -7 So, the value of \\"j\\" that makes this equation true is -7.

Ie:music put tickets for Williams's 2017 tour on Get Me In and Seatwave - in one case for £65 more, before fees, than a similar ticket on Ticketmaster. The company has previously called on the government to take stronger action against resale sites. Ie:music has not responded to repeated requests for a statement. Ticketmaster, which owns Get Me In and Seatwave, said the tickets - which it describes as \\"platinum\\" tickets - on the sites were \\"priced according to demand, in consultation with our clients, the event organisers\\". Tickets on Ticketmaster for seats on level one, block 126 - for Robbie Williams's gig at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, on Friday 2 June 2017 - were found by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme to be priced at £95, before fees. But on Get Me In, for \\"platinum\\" seats on level one, block 125, at the same gig, seats were priced at £160 before fees - £65 more expensive. Because the tickets came straight from the artist's management team, all the profit goes directly to them. A statement from Ticketmaster said: \\"Platinum tickets are a very small percentage of the best seats in the house that are priced according to demand, in consultation with our clients, the event organisers. \\"The UK live events industry has been successfully using platinum for many years so that the full value of these tickets goes back to the rights holders and not to resellers.\\" In November 2015, Williams's management, ie:music, signed a petition saying: \\"We as artist, managers and agents deplore the increasing industrial-scale abuse and insider exploitation of tickets for music, arts and sports events by ticket touts, and their online associates and facilitators.\\" They wanted the government to take stronger action against resale sites. Promoter Harvey Goldsmith said the position Williams's team were taking made him \\"angry\\". \\"I think it is wrong, but hopefully most of the people who have signed the [2015] petition are acting honourably and are doing everything that they can do to prevent tickets being sold on the secondary market,\\" he said. Conservative MP Andrew Bingham, part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said that \\"somehow, [touts] have worked a way round of abusing this [resale] system\\". He said it appeared that some artists' management teams were \\"now also complicit in it as well\\". In December, the Competition and Marketing Authority announced it was to investigate the resale ticketing market, to ensure sales were complying with consumer rights laws. A representative of Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball and Summertime Ball confirmed they had placed tickets for both those events directly on StubHub, but added they had not increased the prices. The Victoria Derbyshire programme also found resale websites StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave were providing specialist software - which could be used by touts - to enable users to sell large volumes of tickets through their platforms. To sign up for StubHub's software, StubHub Pro, users have to show they have sold more than 50,000 (£40,000) worth of tickets in a year. The software allows users to sell tickets in different currencies, as well as in volume. StubHub has not responded to requests for a statement. Ticketmaster said its software, Ticket Utils, was not available in the UK. Both have previously spoken out against computer programs known as \\"bots\\", which have long been cited as a major problem in helping touts buy large volumes of tickets ahead of the general sale to fans. In Italy, the country's lawmakers have moved to ban secondary ticketing, after a media investigation found evidence that Live Nation Italy was selling thousands of tickets directly on Viagogo at higher prices. In a previous statement to Billboard Magazine, Live Nation Italy said the allegations related to a \\"small number of tickets, for a handful of international artists\\". Neither Viagogo or Live Nation UK have responded to repeated requests for a statement. Andy Inglis, an artist manager from 5000 management, called the practice \\"morally bankrupt\\". \\"I just think artists should answer to their fans more,\\" he said. \\"There should be more accountability. \\"But I guess when the artists get bigger, they are more removed from their fans. \\"So I think you can more easily set aside your ethics and charge what you want.\\" Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

What is the answer for the question: What was the 2001 population count of the town that was a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing? from the following article ? Neilston (Scots: Neilstoun, Scottish Gaelic: Baile Nèill, pronounced [paləˈnɛːʎ]) is a village and parish in East Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the Levern Valley, 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Barrhead, 3.8 miles (6.1 km) south of Paisley, and 5.7 miles (9.2 km) south-southwest of Renfrew, at the southwestern fringe of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Neilston is a dormitory village with a resident population of just over 5,000 people. Neilston is mentioned in documents from the 12th century, when the feudal lord Robert de Croc, endowed a chapel to Paisley Abbey to the North. Neilston Parish Church—a Category B listed building—is said to be on the site of this original chapel and has been at the centre of the community since 1163. Little remains of the original structure. Before industrialisation, Neilston was a scattered farming settlement composed of a series of single-storey houses, many of them thatched. Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax. The urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the Industrial Revolution. Industrial scale textile processing was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several cotton mills. Neilston became a centre for cotton and calico bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a spinning and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former milling village, agriculture has played, and continues to play, an economic role. The annual Neilston Agricultural Show is an important trading and cultural event for farmers from southwest Scotland each spring.Although heavy industry died out in the latter half of the 20th century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Neilston has continued to grow as a commuter village, supported by its position between Paisley and Glasgow, from roughly 1,000...

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water. Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish. You can see another example in Figure below . Q: What is the term for decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water? Choices: - scavengers - recyclers - consumers - detritivores A: Answer:","completion":"The term for decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water is detritivores. These organisms play a crucial role in breaking down and recycling organic matter within ecosystems. They help to convert dead plant and animal material into simpler compounds, which can then be utilized by other organisms within the ecosystem. This process contributes to nutrient cycling and maintaining overall ecosystem health. Detritivores differ from scavengers in that they primarily feed on dead or decomposing organic matter, whereas scavengers typically consume the remains of dead animals. While both groups contribute to decomposition, they target different types of organic matter. Examples of scavengers include vultures, hyenas, and some species of beetles. Recyclers, though not a specific ecological classification, can be thought of as a broad term that encompasses both detritivores and scavengers. They are organisms that help recycle nutrients by breaking down organic material and returning it to the ecosystem in a form that other organisms can use. Consumers, on the other hand, are a more general category in ecology, comprising all organisms that obtain their energy by consuming other organisms or organic matter. This category is further divided into primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores), and tertiary consumers (apex predators). Detritivores can be considered a type of consumer, but their specific role in breaking down and recycling organic matter sets them apart from other consumers. In summary, the answer is detritivores, as they are the decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris collected on the ground or at the bottom of water. Their important role in breaking down and recycling organic matter helps maintain nutrient cycling and overall ecosystem health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Michael Naughton, 24, was caught doing quite the opposite when he was arrested for allegedly attempting to break in to a police station. Mr Naughton was seen ‘violently pulling’ a locked door at a downtown Boston Police station at 2.30 in the morning. Breaking into the law: Michael Naughton, 24, was arrested for allegedly attempting to break in to a police station in downtown Boston. Naughton, from Somerville, Boston, was discovered as he made his way through the garage door. He then entered a secured area inside the District A-1 station on Tuesday morning and confronted several police officers. According to officers, Naughton became ‘belligerent and yelled at the officers to get out of his house,’ CBS Boston reported. Despite being informed several times that he was inside a police station, Mr Naughton kept shouting his address and argued with the officers. Naughton entered District A-1 Boston police station through a garage door and yelled at officers to 'get out of his house' Police officers were forced to handcuff him after a short struggle after which he was placed in custody. He was arrested and eventually charged with breaking and entering in the nighttime and resisting arrest. A court appearance date has yet to be announced.

Panel Says The United Nations said on Thursday that the Islamic State has committed genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq and Syria. GENEVA — Islamic State forces have committed genocide and other war crimes in a continuing effort to exterminate the Yazidi religious minority in Syria and Iraq, United Nations investigators said on Thursday, urging stronger international action to halt the killing and to prosecute the terrorist group. The investigators detailed mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam, saying they were shot in the head or their throats were slit, often in front of their families, littering roadsides with corpses. Dozens of mass graves have been uncovered in areas recaptured from Islamic State and are being investigated. The investigators have produced 11 reports documenting wide-ranging crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by many parties to the five-year-old civil war in Syria, but in a report released on Thursday, they invoked the crime of genocide. They based their findings on actions taken by the Islamic State since August 2014 against 400,000 members of the Yazidi community, followers of a centuries-old religion drawing on many faiths. “Genocide has occurred and is ongoing,” Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, chairman of the panel, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, said in a statement. “ISIS has subjected every Yazidi woman, child or man that it has captured to the most horrific atrocities,” he told reporters in Geneva, using an acronym for the Islamic State. “ISIS permanently sought to erase the Yazidis through killing, sexual slavery, enslavement, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and forcible transfer causing serious bodily and mental harm.” Those acts, he said, clearly demonstrated its intent to destroy the Yazidi community in whole or in part. More than 3,200 Yazidi women were still being held by Islamic State fighters, mostly in Syria, the panel found. “The crime of genocide must trigger much more assertive action at the political level, including at the Security Council,” Mr. Pinheiro said, calling for the case to be referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, or to another international tribunal. “Nothing has been done to save these people, and we hope for stronger action by the international community,” Mr. Pinheiro said, highlighting the obligation for countries under the 1948 genocide convention to take action to prevent it. The report compiled by the panel — based on interviews with survivors, religious leaders, smugglers and medical personnel, among others — had identified individuals responsible for acts of genocide and provided “a road map for prosecution,” said Carla Del Ponte, a Swiss lawyer on the commission and a former prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The commission on Syria has repeatedly recommended referral of the crimes to the International Criminal Court, but no action has followed from the Security Council, where Russia, a permanent member and the closest ally of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, wields a veto. The commission had collected names and details of perpetrators and had shared information with some national authorities, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai legal scholar on the commission, who called the report “a wonderful gift” to the five permanent members of the Security Council “so that they can consider acting together.” Secretary of State John Kerry said in March that the United States had determined that Islamic State had committed genocide against Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims, but Andrew Clapham, an international law professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said the rigorous analysis presented by the commission of inquiry would carry more legal weight. The Yazidis came to broad public attention after Islamic State fighters captured Mount Sinjar, in northern Iraq, in 2014 and engaged in systematic slaughter. Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook Sinjar last fall. Mass killings were only part of the Islamic State’s systematic campaign to eliminate the Yazidi community, the panel found, citing documents that revealed careful planning for treatment of the community after it was overrun and a “massive organizational effort” to coordinate the actions of fighters across Iraq. “ISIS made no secret of its intent to destroy the Yazidis of Sinjar, and that is one of the elements that allowed us to conclude their actions amount to genocide,” Ms. Del Ponte said. In addition to the killings, Islamic State fighters systematically separated Yazidi men and women and carried out rape, sexual mutilation and sterilization to prevent the birth of Yazidi babies, and they transferred captured Yazidi children to the fighters’ families and training camps, cutting them off from Yazidi beliefs and practices and “erasing their identities as Yazidis.” The panel reported in harrowing detail the acute trauma experienced by women and girls as young as 9 who were sold off as spoils of war to become sex slaves of Islamic State fighters, routinely raped and punished with extreme violence if they resisted or tried to escape. Islamic State fighters often targeted younger Yazidi children as a means of punishing their mothers, the report said. It cited an account of a fighter who killed several children after their mother’s effort to escape failed: The mother was then beaten and raped because she cried over their deaths. “No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,” the report said.","completion":"The United Nations has said that ISIS committed and is still committing genocide against the Yazidi people, an ancient religious minority in Iraq and Syria. ISIS has been trying to wipe out the Yazidis by killing the men and boys, turning women into sex slaves, horrible acts of torture, and kidnapping and brainwashing children. Over 3,200 Yazidi women are still being held by ISIS fighters mostly in Syria. The United Nations is asking for stronger international action to stop and punish ISIS for these terrible acts against the Yazidis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In 2006, U2 started work on the follow-up to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), collaborating with producer Rick Rubin. After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, \\"We're gonna continue to be a band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder. But whatever it is, it's not gonna stay where it is.\\"Rubin encouraged a \\"back to basics\\" approach and wanted the group to bring finished songs to the studio.

This will ensure you are prepared and can complete the task efficiently. Step 2: Choose an option From the given options: Option 1 - Mix sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a bowl with a whisk. Option 2 - Mix sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a saucepan with a whisk. I would recommend choosing Option 1, as mixing the ingredients in a mixing bowl is the standard procedure for making cookie dough. Mixing the ingredients in a saucepan (Option 2) is not ideal because cookie dough is not typically cooked on the stovetop and it's easier to mix the ingredients in a larger and more open container, such as a bowl. Step 3: Mixing the ingredients Follow Option 1: Mix the sugar, eggs, flour, and peanut butter in a bowl with a whisk or a spatula. Start by creaming together the sugar and room temperature softened butter first, then add the eggs and mix well. Next, stir in the peanut butter, followed by the flour. Mix until the dough is well-combined. Step 4: Chill the dough Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This step will allow the dough to firm up, making it easier to handle and shape into cookies. Step 5: Preheat the oven Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) before baking the cookies. This ensures a consistent temperature throughout the baking process. Step 6: Shape the dough into cookies Using a spoon or cookie scoop, portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet, leaving space between the dough balls for the cookies to spread as they bake.

Il est souvent complexe de mesurer les objectifs et les insuffisances de financement dans divers contextes, tels que les projets, les organisations et les initiatives. Cette difficulté provient généralement de plusieurs facteurs, dont la variabilité des contextes et des besoins, l'évolution des objectifs fixés, et les incertitudes liées aux approvisionnements financiers. Les objectifs se réfèrent aux buts que les organisations, les entreprises ou les individus souhaitent atteindre. Ils peuvent être très spécifiques ou larges, varier en fonction du domaine ou de l'activité concernée et changer au fil du temps. Dans certains cas, il peut être simple de mesurer le progrès vers la réalisation d'un objectif, par exemple, en comptabilisant le nombre de clients, de ventes ou de projets achevés. Cependant, il est souvent difficile de quantifier ces objectifs, car ils peuvent être très diversifiés et multidimensionnels, impliquant de multiples aspects et indicateurs. Le financement est également un facteur critique dans la réalisation des objectifs, car les projets et les initiatives ont besoin de ressources et de soutien financier pour être menés à bien. Toutefois, les sources de financement et les opportunités peuvent varier sensiblement, ce qui complique l'évaluation des pénuries de financement. Les causes possibles de ces pénuries incluent les contraintes budgétaires, les changements dans les priorités gouvernementales ou privées, les cycles économiques et les fluctuations financières. Pour résoudre ce problème, les organisations devraient se concentrer sur une meilleure planification et un ciblage plus précis, tout en demeurant flexibles et ouverts à l'apprentissage et à l'adaptation. De plus, il est essentiel pour les organisations de rechercher et de mobiliser diverses sources de financement, de peaufiner leurs stratégies de financement et de faire preuve de transparence et de responsabilité dans la gestion de leurs ressources. Il est crucial de développer des outils et des méthodologies pour quantifier les objectifs et identifier les pénuries de financement. Cela peut inclure la création de indicateurs clés de performance (KPI), l'élaboration de plans stratégiques et opérationnels, les études de faisabilité, les recherches sur les sources de financement et les partenariats possibles, et la mise en place de systèmes de suivi et d'évaluation.

He is the central figure of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which is the principal narration of the events connected to his incarnation on Earth, his ideals and his greatness. Rama is one of the many deities in Hinduism and especially of the various Vaishnava sects. Religious texts and scriptures based on his life have been a formative component in numerous cultures of South and Southeast Asia. Along with Krishna, Rama is considered to be one of the most important avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric sects, he is considered the Supreme Being, rather than an avatar. - Ramanand Sagar (29 December 1917 12 December 2005) (born Chandramauli Chopra) was an Indian film director. He is most famous for making the \\"Ramayan\\" television series, a 78-part TV adaptation of the ancient Hindu epic of the same name, starring Arun Govil as Lord Ram and Deepika Chikhalia as Sita.

It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - Krishna (Sanskrit: , \\"\\" in IAST, pronounced ) is a major Hindu deity worshiped in a variety of different perspectives.

It is a pluricentric language, with two official forms, Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu, which are its standardised registers, and which may be called Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu when taken together. The colloquial registers are mostly indistinguishable, and even though the official standards are nearly identical in grammar, they differ in literary conventions and in academic and technical vocabulary, with Urdu adopting stronger Persian, Turkic and Arabic influences, and Hindi relying more heavily on Sanskrit. Before the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the terms \\"Hindustani, Urdu,\\" and \\"Hindi\\" were synonymous; all covered what would be called Urdu and Hindi today. The term \\"Hindustani\\" is still used for the colloquial language and \\"lingua franca\\" of North India and Pakistan, for example for the language of Bollywood films, as well as for several quite different varieties of Hindi spoken outside the Indian Subcontinent, such as Fiji Hindi of Fiji and the Caribbean Hindustani of Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, Barbados, and the rest of the Caribbean.

It is written from left to right, has a strong preference for symmetrical rounded shapes within squared outlines, and is recognisable by a horizontal line that runs along the top of full letters. In a cursory look, the Devanagari script appears different from other Indic scripts such as Bengali, Oriya, or Gurmukhi, but a closer examination reveals they are very similar except for angles and structural emphasis. - Guyana (pronounced or ), officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you separate string cheese?","completion":"Separating string cheese is quite a simple process, although it may require some patience and finesse. String cheese, made from mozzarella, has a stringy texture due to the way the cheese proteins line up during the production process. Here's a detailed guide on how to separate string cheese: 1. Choose your string cheese: First and foremost, select a good quality string cheese. It's best to go for a mozzarella-based cheese that is specifically marketed as \\"string cheese\\" because these are designed to be easily peeled. 2. Prepare a clean surface: Make sure you have a clean surface to work with, and that your hands are clean too. It will help ensure that the cheese remains fresh and untainted by unwanted substances. 3. Remove the wrapper: Carefully remove the plastic wrapper that encases the cheese. Be gentle to avoid damaging or squashing the cheese as it can affect the stringing process. 4. Examine the cheese: Look for a seam or any hint of a starting point. Most string cheese has a noticeable edge or a split between the strings. If there's an indentation or a natural \\"V\\" shape in the cheese, you could utilize it as the starting point for peeling. 5. Hold the cheese: Grasp the cheese firmly in one hand near the top. It's essential to have a firm grip so that the cheese doesn't slip while you're peeling away the strings. 6. Begin peeling: Use your other hand's thumb and index finger to gently grip the seam or edge of the cheese. Start pulling the cheese apart in the direction of the seam or indentation, slowly separating a string from the main body of the cheese. 7. Apply gentle pressure: As you separate a string, apply gentle, even pressure as you pull it away from the rest of the cheese. The goal is to create thin, even strings and not to break them off abruptly. You may need to adjust your grip and the angle at which you're pulling to maintain consistent pressure as you separate each string. 8. Continue pulling strings: Work your way around the cheese, gently but firmly pulling each new string away from the main body. Ideally, you should be able to create numerous strings that vary in length and thickness, depending on your preference. 9. Monitor your progress: As you go, check to ensure that the cheese is separating evenly and isn't tearing or breaking off in chunks. If you encounter any difficulties, adjust your grip, pressure, or angle to better separate the cheese. 10. Enjoy your string cheese: Once you've successfully separated the desired number of strings, it's time to enjoy your cheese! Be sure to store any remaining, unpeeled cheese in a sealed container to keep it fresh for future snacking. It's worth mentioning that practice makes perfect. The more you separate string cheese, the better you'll become at achieving the ideal thickness and length of the strings. Moreover, each cheese stick may have slightly different textures and stringiness, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't perfect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago.

Q:As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte. Question: \\"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services?

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra\\" correctly answer the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\"? Options are: - no; - yes;","completion":"- yes; The response \\"Sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra\\" correctly answers the question \\"What attracted bigger vessels to the island?\\" because it tells us that the harbor in Melaka was safe and protected from the strong winds and rain, making it an ideal location for large ships to come and trade.

Question: Information: - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901 28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity. - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\". - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English. - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects. - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb . - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb. - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders? The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

Chris Austin Hadfield (born 29 August 1959) is a retired Canadian astronaut who was the first Canadian to walk in space. An engineer and former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot, Hadfield has flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander of the International Space Station. Hadfield, who was raised on a farm in southern Ontario, was inspired as a child when he watched the Apollo 11 Moon landing on TV. He attended high school in Oakville and Milton and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. Hadfield attended White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario until his senior year and then graduated as an Ontario Scholar from Milton District High School in 1977. As a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, he earned a glider pilot scholarship at age 15 and a powered pilot scholarship at age 16. After graduating from high school in 1978, he joined the Canadian Armed Forces and spent two years at Royal Roads Military College followed by two years at the Royal Military College, where he received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1982. Before graduating, he also underwent basic flight training at CFB Portage la Prairie. In 1983, he took honours as the top graduate from Basic Jet Training at CFB Moose Jaw, and then went on to train as a tactical fighter pilot with 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, flying the Canadair CF-116 Freedom Fighter and the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet. After completing his fighter training, Hadfield flew CF-18 Hornets with 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying intercept missions for NORAD. He was the first CF-18 pilot to intercept a Soviet Tupolev Tu 95 long-range bomber in the Canadian Arctic. In the late 1980s, Hadfield attended the US Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base and served as an exchange officer with the US Navy at Strike Test Directorate at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. His accomplishments from 1989 to 1992 included testing the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft; performing research work with NASA on pitch control margin simulation and flight; completing the first military flight of F/A-18 enhanced performance engines; piloting the first flight test of the National Aerospace Plane external burning hydrogen propulsion engine; developing a new handling qualities rating scale for high angle-of-attack test; and participating in the F/A-18 out-of-control recovery test program. In May 1992, Hadfield graduated with a master's degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee Space Institute, where his thesis concerned high-angle attack aerodynamics of the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet.

Process: - The animal eats large quantities of food that will be stored as fat - Winter comes and the animal finds a place to hibernate - Over a period of days, the animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly - Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active - The animal has entered hibernation mode - Question: suppose there is a global war happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A global war can have significant consequences on an animal's ability to hibernate properly, potentially increasing the challenges and threats it faces during this critical period of energy conservation. In such a scenario, the negative impact on hibernation is likely to be more pronounced, leading to the selection of option A: more. Several factors contribute to the heightened difficulties for animals during hibernation amid a global conflict: 1. Destruction of natural habitats: Warfare often brings about widespread destruction of the environment, whether through direct combat operations or the secondary effects of military activity. This can lead to the obliteration of essential animal habitats, making it challenging for them to find secure and suitable locations to hibernate. 2. Increased noise and human presence: The hustle and bustle of war can lead to elevated levels of noise pollution and an increase in human presence around animal habitats. This can be particularly detrimental to the hibernation process, as excessive noise and disruption can disturb an animal's ability to enter and maintain a hibernative state. 3. Scarcity of food resources: Large-scale conflicts can lead to the disruption of food supply chains, affecting the availability of adequate nourishment for animals. As hibernation is an energy conservation mechanism that relies on an animal's ability to store fat, a lack of sufficient nutrition in the run-up to hibernation can severely hamper an animal's chances of surviving the winter months. 4. Pollution and environmental changes: War can result in pollution of natural habitats as well as changes to local ecosystems, which can have a myriad of detrimental effects on all species within the vicinity. For animals preparing to hibernate, this may alter their ability to find proper hibernation sites with the necessary environmental conditions. 5. Escalated stress levels: Animals exposed to the stressors associated with warfare may be unable to enter the deep relaxation state necessary for hibernation. Chronic stress can result in hormonal changes that could make it difficult for an animal to hibernate properly, as the physiological and behavioral processes involved are disrupted. In conclusion, a global war can greatly harm an animal's ability to hibernate properly. The destruction of habitats, increased noise and human presence, scarcity of food resources, pollution, and higher stress levels all contribute to the challenges faced by animals entering hibernation during times of war. Consequently, the correct answer to the question of how a global war could affect an animal's hibernation process is A: more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Was the arrival of the Europeans a positive development for the Arawaks?\\"?

Additionally, as their population decreased, slaves from Africa were imported to work the land, which further indicates that the Arawaks were negatively affected by the arrival of Europeans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Epicurus (or \\"ally, comrade\\"; 341270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher as well as the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters of Epicurus's 300 written works remain. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators. - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood. - Themista of Lampsacus , the wife of Leonteus , was a student of Epicurus , early in the 3rd century BCE . Epicurus ' school was unusual in the 3rd century , in that it allowed women to attend , and we also hear of Leontion attending Epicurus ' school around the same time .

Although Price claimed his birth was in Shropshire he was actually born in London in Red Lion Square on the site of the South Place Ethical Society's Conway Hall. He was educated in New Cross, first at Waller Road Infants School and then Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School. At 15, Price founded the Carlton Dramatic Society and wrote plays, including a drama, about his early experience with a poltergeist which he said took place at a haunted manor house in Shropshire. According to Richard Morris, in his recent biography Harry Price: On 4 February 1922, Price with James Seymour, Eric Dingwall and William Marriott had proven the spirit photographer William Hope was a fraud during tests at the British College of Psychic Science. Price wrote in his SPR report \\"William Hope has been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates for those of a sitter ... It implies that the medium brings to the sitting a duplicate slide and faked plates for fraudulent purposes.\\" Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials. Price later re-published the Society's experiment in a pamphlet of his own called Cold Light on Spiritualistic \\"Phenomena\\" - An Experiment with the Crewe Circle. Due to the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism. Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from his laboratory and claimed if he persisted to write \\"sewage\\" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Houdini. Doyle and other spiritualists attacked Price and tried for years to have Price take his pamphlet out of circulation. Price wrote \\"Arthur Conan Doyle and his friends abused me for years for exposing Hope.\\" On 7 October 1930 it was claimed by spiritualists that Eileen J. Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a seance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident. The event \\"attracted worldwide attention\\", thanks to the presence of a reporter. Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further seances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims. Price did not come to any definite conclusion about Garrett and the seances: It is not my intention to discuss if the medium were really controlled by the discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters. \\"Spirit\\" or \\"trance personality\\" would be equally interesting explanations - and equally remarkable. There is no real evidence for either hypothesis. But it is not my intention to discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment. Garrett's claims have since been questioned. The magician John Booth analysed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud. According to Booth Garrett's notes and writings show she followed the building of the R101 and she may have been given aircraft blueprints by a technician from the airdrome. However, the researcher Melvin Harris who studied the case wrote no secret accomplice was needed as the information described in Garrett's seances were \\"either commonplace, easily absorbed bits and pieces, or plain gobbledegook. The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\" In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. PS50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions. Price was sceptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test seances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \\"ectoplasm\\". Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide. The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analysed by psychical researchers and reported to be made from egg white. According to Price: The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the \\"teleplasm\\" went down her throat. This time it wasn't cheese-cloth. It proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened tube ... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men wasting time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook. Price wrote up the case in Leaves from a Psychist's Case Book (1933) in a chapter called \\"The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers\\". In his report Price published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits. Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted the ectoplasm materialisations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the seance room. During Duncan's famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her travelling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.

Please answer the following question: Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

Q: The simplest example of what type of 'organ system' is the gastrovascular cavity found in organisms with only one opening for the process? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Invertebrate Digestive Systems Animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. The simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 34.5a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the “mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity. The alimentary canal, shown in Figure 34.5b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.

Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. - Roussillon (or ; ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \\"département\\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees). It may also refer to \\"Northern Catalonia\\" or \\"French Catalonia\\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it. - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. - Languedoc-Roussillon is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Occitanie. It comprises five departments, and borders the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées on the one side, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea on the other side. It is the southernmost region of mainland France. - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba. - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian. - Languedoc ( Occitan: \\"Lengadòc\\" ) is a former province of France. Its territory is now contained in the modern-day region of Occitanie in the south of France. Its capital city was Toulouse. It had an area of approximately 27,376 square kilometers (10,570 square miles). - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\". - Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \\"Gaul of Narbonne\\", from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\\"our Province\\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\\"Transalpine Gaul\\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Its boundaries were roughly defined by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Cévennes and Alps to the north and west. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania. - Arius (250 or 256336) was a Christian presbyter and ascetic of Berber origin, and priest in Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325. - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire. - Septimania ( ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\"). - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood. - Arianism, in Christianity, is a Christological concept that asserts that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was created by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is, therefore subordinate to God and not the same as. Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c. AD 250336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the prevailing theological views held by proto-orthodox Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist but was created by God the Father. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half. - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania. - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis. - Reccared ( or Recared ; Latin : Reccaredus ; Spanish : Recaredo ) I ( c. 559 -- 31 May 601 ) ( reigned 586 -- 601 ) was Visigothic King of Hispania , Septimania and Galicia . His reign marked a climactic shift in history , with the king 's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Chalcedonian Christianity in 587 . Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia . Like his father , Reccared had his capital at Toledo . The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians , while the Hispano - Roman population were Roman Catholics . The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild , Hermenegild , to Catholicism . Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role . When King Leovigild died , within a few weeks of April 21 , 586 , bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo . The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition . In January 587 , Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism , the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania . Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example , certainly those around him at Toledo , but there were Arian uprisings , notably in Septimania , his northernmost province , beyond the Pyrenees , where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc , who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius . Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection , the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy , who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius . Reccared 's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter , Desiderius himself being slain . The next conspiracy broke out in the west , Lusitania , headed by Sunna , the Arian bishop of Mérida , and count Seggo . Claudius , Reccared 's dux Lusitaniae , put down the rising , Sunna being banished... - Theodoric II (Gothic: Þiudareiks II), \\"Teodorico\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, (426 early 466) was the eighth King of Visigoths from 453 to 466. - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.

Continue the following story. Elena always took more cake than Tanya, as","completion":"the older sister, and she wholeheartedly enjoyed taking full advantage of her seniority. One sunny afternoon, Tanya brought in a freshly baked chocolate cake from the kitchen, setting it down onto the table. The aroma of the warm, velvety cake filled the room, and even though Tanya felt a bit annoyed at the prospect of Elena eating more than her, she couldn't resist the feeling of joy and pride that came from baking such a delightful treat. Elena entered the room with a bright smile, her eyes immediately fixed on the cake. The two sisters sat at the table, eagerly preparing to dig in. \\"Remember, I'm older, so I get more cake than you,\\" Elena said with a cheeky grin, as she grabbed the knife to cut herself a generous slice. Tanya's eyes narrowed, but she remained silent. Just this once, she thought, I want to have as much cake as Elena, if not more. As time went by, Tanya grew increasingly more tired of the cake divide. She might have been the younger sister, but she was also the one who put the most effort into making the cakes. The hours spent perfecting the recipes, decorating them immaculately, and adding that little touch of magic, were all her own. One day, she had an idea. While she was leafing through a new cookbook, she stumbled upon a recipe for magically transforming cream. The cream, when properly charmed, would grow in quantity whenever someone tried to take away more than their fair share. If Elena tried to take more, the cream would replenish the cake piece for Tanya, ensuring equality in every bite. Tanya decided to put this magical method of fairness to the test, carefully following the recipe to enchant the cream in the book. She spent hours perfecting her new creation, a beautiful raspberry and vanilla cream cake. She presented the cake at dinner, watching Elena's eyes widen with delight. As usual, Elena reached for the knife and attempted to cut a larger slice for herself than for her younger sister. However, the moment she attempted to place the disproportionate slice on her own plate, something marvelous happened. The cake piece on Tanya's plate grew to match the size of Elena's. The enchanted cream had worked! Elena looked at Tanya in shock, then at the cake quizzically. In turn, Tanya couldn't help but smile, knowing she had finally found a way to enjoy her own creations equally. From that day on, the sisters enjoyed fair shares of cake. Elena, in time, began to appreciate the hard work and love poured into every delicious pastry Tanya baked and understood that her younger sister deserved an equal slice of happiness. This magical cream not only equalized their dessert servings but brought them closer as sisters, teaching them the value of sharing and appreciating one another's efforts. The enchanted cream's recipe eventually became a family secret, passed down through generations always reminding them that the best moments of life are truly sweeter when they are shared fairly among family and friends. And as for Tanya, she continued to bake the most delightful cakes, using her newfound magic to teach others the importance of kindness, fairness, and a love for the sweeter things in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bernie Sanders and billionaire Donald Trump have won the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries in New Hampshire, in victories so decisive that the drama of primary night shifted to the Republicans battling for second, third and fourth place. Projected to finish in second was Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a relatively moderate candidate who might face a difficult time unifying the party behind him in the next few primary states. After Kasich, there was a close race for third between Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) — who won the Iowa caucuses last week — and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Behind all of them was Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who had been seen as the strongest challenger to Trump until a disastrous debate performance on Saturday, in which New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie attacked Rubio and the senator responded by repeating the same talking point over and over. But if Christie’s attack had hurt Rubio, it didn’t seem to have helped Christie himself: Christie was running behind Rubio, last among the four “establishment” candidates. The results for his challengers seemed to be a good one for Trump, since it was likely that a large number of them would continue on to the next primaries, dividing the voters who want to see Trump defeated. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders thanked supporters for high voter turnout after winning the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. (Reuters) [New Hampshire primary election results] In the Democratic race, Sanders was projected as the winner over former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who had been seen as her party’s prohibitive favorite a year ago. “Nine months ago, we began our campaign here in New Hampshire, we had no campaign organization. We had no money. And we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America,” Sanders said to his supporters. “And tonight, with what it appears to be a record-breaking voter turnout, because of a huge voter turnout – and I say YUGE! – we won,” Sanders said, poking fun at the New York City accent he shares with Trump. The crowd had yelled “YUUUGE!” along with him. Sanders said that the enthusiasm his supporters showed in New Hampshire could be replicated in other primaries and in a general election, with a strongly left-wing message drawing out new voters who’d be left unenthused by a centrist. “That is what will happen all over this country!” Sanders said. Sanders is a self-identified “democratic socialist,” originally little known outside Washington and his home state of Vermont. But he built a massive movement with rousing attacks on the power of Wall Street, and a promise of a “political revolution” that would provide universal, government-run health insurance and free public-college tuition. Sanders was also helped by Clinton’s struggles to explain why she’d used a private email server to handle government business while she was secretary of state, a scandal that has hung over her candidacy for months. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses ecstatic supporters following his win in the New Hampshire primary. (Reuters) “Now we take this campaign to this entire country. We are going to fight for every vote in every state,” Clinton told supporters after conceding. She then returned to a constant theme of her campaign, which was that she — unlike Sanders — was ready for the long slog that politics demands. “People have every right to be angry. But they’re also hungry. They’re hungry for solutions.” Clinton’s defeat in New Hampshire was so resounding – and so long anticipated – that Clinton’s campaign conceded immediately when the polls closed at 8 p.m. The campaign sent out a statement downplaying the importance of New Hampshire, which Clinton won in 2008. Her campaign promised to fight on through March, including the next-up contests in Nevada and South Carolina. The next states, Clinton’s campaign said, would be more likely to turn out her way. [New Hampshire primary live updates:] “Whereas the electorates in Iowa and New Hampshire are largely rural/suburban and predominantly white, the March states better reflect the true diversity of the Democratic Party and the nation,” Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the statement. Clinton’s campaign has said it expects to do far better among African American and Latino voters than Sanders will. Exit polls reported by CNN showed that Sanders had beaten Clinton across a wide variety of demographic groups — including women, who voted for Sanders by a margin of 55 percent to 44 percent. Sanders also won decisively among self-identified independents, taking that group by 72 percent. The two candidates evenly split voters who identified themselves as Democrats. Sanders also won all the ideological groups that the polls surveyed: Democratic voters calling themselves “very liberal,” “somewhat liberal,” and “moderate” all preferred him to Clinton. Another telling detail: Clinton won handily among the voters who said the quality they wanted most in a candidate was “electability.” Her advantage among that group was 81 percent to 18 percent. But Sanders dominated in the group that said the most important quality was that the candidate “cares,” and in the group that said it was most important that the candidate was honest. In the group that cared about honesty, Sanders won by 92 percent to 6 percent, according to CNN. Among Republicans, Trump’s victory — even though it had been predicted for weeks — is still a remarkable turnabout. Last summer, Trump had seemed like an afterthought in a race that seemed likely to be dominated by former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and the massive campaign warchest assembled to back Bush. But Trump’s TV experience made him a commanding figure in early debates, where other candidates seemed unsure how to handle a candidate who insulted their looks and told them to shush. And Trump’s blunt message, which promised a massive wall on the southern border and a program to deport 12 million undocumented immigrants, resonated with voters who felt their party had ignored the issue for too long. “We are going to do something so good, and so fast, and so strong. And the world is going to respect us again. Believe me,” Trump said to supporters, during a speech that began with Trump thanking his late parents. Trump then reviewed a series of campaign promises, including his plan to build a wall on the southern border. “We’re going to build a wall. It’s going to be built. It’s not even, it’s not even a difficult thing to do.” He also said he would be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.” The crowd chanted “Trump! Trump! Trump!” “That’s so beautiful,” Trump said. In a moment that captured so much of this campaign, Trump’s speech happened at the same time as Bush’s own speech, and largely kept Bush – projected a year ago as the race’s favorite – off the air. For Trump, the victory here in New Hampshire was a vindication of his unusual campaign style, which favored huge rallies and free TV exposure over the kind of data-driven, expensive voter-turnout efforts that mark most modern campaigns. In Iowa, Trump used that approach and lost to Cruz and his high-tech “ground game.” But in New Hampshire, it was enough. Trump’s approach is likely to be tested further in the upcoming contests in the South, starting with South Carolina’s primary on Feb. 20 and turning a week later to a group of “Super Tuesday” states. One of the big New Hampshire surprises was Kasich, a pragmatic Midwesterner whose candidacy has been an afterthought nationally but who steadily built a pitch-perfect campaign for this state that roused mainstream voters with high visibility on the ground and a call to lift up people in the shadows. Kasich told supporters Tuesday night that his second place finish was evidence an optimistic message could win. “There’s magic in the air with this campaign,” Kasich said. “We never went negative, because we have more good to sell.” The Ohio governor called on supporters to join his effort “to re-shine America. To restore the spirit of America. And to leave no one behind.” But the race now moves south, where Kasich faces immediate hurdles to prove he is more than a one-state wonder and where Trump has found deep and enthusiastic support for his incendiary nationalistic platform. Cruz is well positioned to contend with Trump for the top spot in those states because of his broad coalition of movement conservatives and evangelicals. Republican exit polls reported by CNN showed how dominant Trump’s victory in New Hampshire had been. Trump won among people who said they had been “betrayed by Republican politicians” – but also among those who didn’t feel betrayed. Trump won both men and women, won the married and the unmarried, won college graduates and non-graduates, won high earners and low earners, and won both those who called themselves “conservative” and among those who called themselves “moderate/liberal.” The few sub-groups that Trump did not win included those who called themselves evangelical or born-again: Cruz won that group with 24 percent. But his victory in that group – a core part of Cruz’s support – came by just a single percentage point. In second place, with 23 percent, was Trump. Kasich won among voters who said they were “somewhat worried” about the economy, though Trump won the group that said they were “very worried.” Trump lost among the voters who believed “electability” was the most important quality in a candidate: they went for Rubio. One striking statistic in the poll came from a question that asked voters about what should be done with undocumented immigrants who were already in the U.S. Trump has said he would deport all 12 million of them. It was no surprise, then, that Trump won among the voters who supported mass deportation. But he also won among voters who said that deportation was the wrong choice. Among that group of voters – the 66 percent of Republicans who supported offering legal status to undocumented immigrants, the exact opposite of Trump’s plan – 22 percent supported Trump anyway. That was enough to tie Kasich for first place. The exit polls reported by CNN showed that 66 percent of Republican primary voters supported another idea that Trump has praised: a temporary ban on Muslim foreigners entering the U.S. In that group, not surprisingly, Trump was the most popular candidate, with 42 percent support. For Republicans, the campaign trail in the final push was like a game of political billiards — with attacks flying fast and in all directions, reflecting the jumbled field and the uncertain fates that await so many of the candidates. Bush fired at Trump, Cruz, Kasich and Rubio. Christie savaged Rubio. Rubio smacked back. Trump, for his part, slammed Bush and Cruz. Tuesday night, Bush told his supporters, “The pundits had it all figured out last Monday night when the Iowa caucuses were complete. They said the race was now a three-person race between two freshmen senators and a reality TV star. And while the reality TV star’s still doing well, it looks like you all have reset the race.” Recalling the story of a veteran he met who had been wrongfully declared dead by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bush said, “Just like he’s not dead, this campaign’s not dead – we’re going on to South Carolina.” For the Republicans, the character of the race appeared to change over the weekend after a Saturday debate in which Rubio faltered in the face of stinging barbs from Christie. In an uncharacteristically blunt fashion, Rubio on Tuesday night blamed himself for his poor showing in the primary. “Our disappointment tonight is not on you -- it’s on me. I did not do well on Saturday night. So listen to this: that will never happen again,” he vowed. Late Tuesday, Christie seemed sobered by his defeat – and contemplating an end to his campaign. Before Tuesday’s results were in, Christie had said he planned to campaign in South Carolina, extending his campaign to the next primary state. Now, he said, he would return to New Jersey, and watch for the final results from New Hampshire. “That’s going to allow us to make a decision about how we move from here in this race. But there’s no reason to sit in a hotel in South Carolina to hear that,” Christie said. While in New Jersey, he said, “We can actually get a change of clothes, which would be a nice thing.” If Christie does drop out because of New Hampshire, that would mark the end of a long decline for one of the most talented retail politicians in the race. Christie had once been the front-runner in New Hampshire, way back in 2014, but he was un-done by a scandal from his own administration – in which aides allegedly caused a traffic jam on a major bridge in order to punish a local mayor who hadn’t endorsed Christie’s re-election. And he was out-shone by Trump, who stole away the role that Christie had sought to play: the race’s brash straight-talker. Eilperin and Fahrenthold reported from Washington. Jose A. DelReal in Portsmouth, Jenna Johnson, Sean Sullivan and John Wagner in Concord, Michael Kranish in Plaistow, Abby Phillip, Anne Gearan, Ed O’Keefe and Karen Tumulty in Manchester contributed to this report. ||||| Bernie Sanders thrashed Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, an emphatic early triumph for a populist campaign long dismissed as an afterthought in the Democratic presidential primary. The Vermont senator's dominant performance in his neighboring state could force Clinton's team to reassess its operations and solidify Sanders' candidacy as a serious threat for the nomination. Story Continued Below \\"The people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment, the economic establishment and by the way, to the media establishment,\\" Sanders said in his victory speech. \\"What the people here have said is that given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and establishment economics. The people want real change.\\" He warned his supporters that his win could augur an uglier phase of the race. “They are throwing everything at me but the kitchen sink, and I have a feeling that kitchen sink is coming soon,\\" Sanders said. With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Sanders led Clinton 60 percent to 38 percent. Sanders' senior strategist, Tad Devine, told POLITICO it “was, we believe, the biggest margin of victory in a contested Democratic primary in history.\\" Clinton sought to signal a new stage of her campaign as it looks to regroup for the March contests, which feature more diverse electorates that should aid her cause. \\"It's not whether you get knocked down that matters, it's whether you get back up,\\" she told supporters after calling Sanders to concede. She echoed many of Sanders' campaign themes — vowing to crack down on Wall Street, push for campaign finance reform and fight for women's rights, gay rights and workers' rights — but said that she could actually produce results. “Now we take this campaign to the entire country,\\" she declared. \\"We’re going to fight for every vote in every state. We’re going to fight for real solutions to make a difference in people’s lives.” But the New Hampshire results were so convincing that the race was called as soon as the last polls in the state closed, and Sanders supporters were still making their way into Concord High School for his watch party. Cheers erupted and music blared when TVs showed him as the winner. \\"Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire primary, they would not have believed you,\\" Sanders wrote in a fundraising appeal to supporters asking for 3 a pop. \\"Not at all. Too bold, they would have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires. You showed them tonight.\\" In her own message to supporters, Clinton wrote that she \\"[wished] tonight had gone differently.\\" \\"But I know what it's like to be knocked down -- and I've learned from long experience that it's not whether you get knocked down that matters. It's about whether you get back up,\\" she wrote. The Clinton campaign released a separate memo Tuesday evening mapping out the candidate's way forward. \\"The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong – potentially insurmountable – delegate lead next month,\\" campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the memo, which touted the importance of next month and Super Tuesday in particular. The campaign also emphasized Clinton's strength among Hispanic and African American voters, as well as her broader appeal beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. \\"Additionally, as the campaign moves to states with a heavier presence of military personnel and veterans, Sen. Sanders should expect renewed questions about his foreign policy proposals and preparedness to be Commander-in-Chief,\\" Mook wrote, also pointing to the campaign's \\"data-driven operation\\" to get out the vote in the months to come. \\"We believe that Hillary’s unique level of strength among African Americans, Hispanics, women and working families of all backgrounds – combined with the most data-driven and targeted campaign ever waged – will net the delegates in March needed to put her on a clear path to the nomination,\\" he wrote in the memo. Exit poll data from NBC News suggested that 55 percent of primary voters had made up their mind before last month, while just 23 percent said they had waited until the last few days. CNN's exit poll data showed similar results. Earlier Tuesday, Devine told MSNBC's \\"MTP Daily\\" that the margin of victory was important. “Yes, I mean I think if we have a substantial victory, that will help us even more,\\" he said, noting the importance of bringing in younger and independent voters.\\"I think that’s an important case that we’d want to prove,\\" he added. Moments earlier, Mook told Chuck Todd that their operation is prepared for an \\"uphill climb\\" after Tuesday's primary. Eight years ago, after a humbling third-place Iowa finish, Clinton staged a come-from-behind win in New Hampshire that rescued her campaign. This time, Clinton eked out a win in Iowa, but New Hampshire never looked nearly as kind to her. For his part, Sanders achieved a bit of history with his victory, becoming the first Jewish candidate to win a primary, something that previous contenders such as Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Milton Shapp were unable to achieve. The high stakes for both sides in the first-in-the-nation primary have been on glaring display all week long. In their first head-to-head debate last Thursday in Durham, New Hampshire, the two candidates dropped the comity of the first four debates for a bruising, two-hour rumble. In one memorable clash, Sanders attacked Clinton over her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs; Clinton responded that her rival was leveling a \\"very artful smear\\" of corruption against her: \\"Enough is enough,\\" she admonished. \\"If you've got something to say, say it.\\" Since then, though, Clinton has been on the defensive. After being asked at the debate whether she would release transcripts of her paid speeches, at first she said that she would \\"look into\\" it, but then struck a less amenable tone. “Let everybody who’s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,” Clinton told ABC. “We’ll all release them at the same time.” Generational and gender tensions between the two candidates' supporters grew more pronounced over the weekend. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem declared to Bill Maher that young women are only supporting Sanders because \\"the boys are with Bernie,\\" then later apologized. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a Clinton surrogate, trotted out her maxim, \\"There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.\\" Sanders disavowed a group of supporters calling themselves \\"Berniebros,\\" saying, \\"Anybody who is supporting me and doing sexist things, we don't want them.\\" Former President Bill Clinton got into the act, too, denouncing Sanders (without mentioning him by name) as \\"the champion of all things small and the enemy of all things big.” Clinton had tried to tamp down expectations, saying some pundits have argued she would have been better off skipping the state. On Saturday, both candidates took brief detours from campaigning in the state: Clinton went to Flint, Michigan, to address the water crisis; Sanders traveled to New York City for a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit with his spot-on impersonator, Larry David. Gabriel Debenedetti contributed reporting from Concord, New Hampshire. ||||| Beyond Mr. Trump, four Republicans were clustered together, each receiving less than 20 percent of the vote. Mr. Kasich’s surprise second-place finish was driven by voters who described themselves as moderates and independents and were charmed by his pragmatism and his upbeat campaign. Effectively skipping Iowa, Mr. Kasich spent 62 days in New Hampshire, holding 106 town-hall-style events. “We never went negative because we have more good to sell than to spend our time being critical of somebody else,” an ebullient Mr. Kasich told supporters, vowing “to reshine America, to restore the spirit of America and to leave no one behind.” But as striking as Mr. Kasich’s surge may have been, the fall of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida may have been more significant. Mr. Rubio initially appeared to be capitalizing on his strong finish in Iowa, rising in the polls here, but a disastrous debate performance on Saturday halted his momentum. Mr. Rubio; Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who won the leadoff Iowa caucuses; and Mr. Bush, whose campaign was all but left for dead after a series of poor debate performances and staff cutbacks, were bunched together. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey finished a disappointing sixth after staking his campaign here. With little money left and a slim chance of being eligible for a Republican debate on Saturday, the governor said he was going back to New Jersey on Wednesday “to take a deep breath.” Supporters of Mr. Bush, who formed an alliance with Mr. Christie here as both sought to diminish Mr. Rubio, are lobbying him to endorse the former Florida governor. Mr. Trump’s win is the biggest victory in a New Hampshire Republican primary since at least 2000. He won pluralities of both Republican and independent voters, and showed strength across demographic groups. At an exuberant victory party at a banquet hall in Manchester, people waved foam fingers reading “You’re hired!” or “Make America great again!” Mr. Trump’s remarks ranged from emotional expressions of thanks to his late parents to more belligerent assertions that echoed his stump speech. “I am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” vowed Mr. Trump, adding that he would “knock the hell out of ISIS,” or the Islamic State. ||||| MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders looked to emerge from Tuesday's New Hampshire primary with their first victories of the 2016 presidential election, while rivals hoped a state famous for political surprises would give their own White House bids a needed boost. Even if Republican Trump or Democrat Sanders were to stumble, the two were assured of moving on. However, for some GOP candidates, the outcome could determine whether their campaigns continue beyond the northeastern battleground. A trio of governors — Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Chris Christie — have spent most of their time in the state in recent weeks and needed to show voters, as well as crucial financial donors, that they're viable candidates. \\"This is my 72nd day in the state,\\" Christie, the New Jersey governor, said during a campaign stop Tuesday. \\"I think I've done enough to do well here.\\" The governors believe their prospects were helped by Marco Rubio's rocky debate performance last week, which they say exposed the Florida senator as too inexperienced to serve as president. However, it was unknown heading into Tuesday's contest whether voters would shy away from Rubio or help him make the case that he's best positioned to take on Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. If Rubio and the governors finish in a pack, it's likely to frustrate Republican Party elites who are eager to coalesce around a single candidate to challenge Trump and Cruz, whom they believe could be unelectable in November. Nearly half of voters in the Republican primary made up their mind in the past week, according to early exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the Associated Press and the television networks. Republican voters were more negative about their politicians than Democrats, with about half of GOP voters saying they felt betrayed by party officials. In a sign of Trump's impact on the race, two-thirds of GOP voters said they support a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., a position the billionaire outlined last year amid rising fears of terrorism emanating from the Middle East. Among Democrats, Sanders has maintained a sizeable advantage over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire for weeks. The state is friendly territory for the senator from neighboring Vermont and a must-win if he's to stay competitive with Clinton as the race moves to more diverse states that are seen as more hospitable to the former secretary of state. \\"If we have a large voter turnout I think we're going to do just fine,\\" Sanders told reporters as he took a walk around Concord Tuesday afternoon. Clinton started her day at a Manchester polling site, where she thanked volunteers and local supporters. \\"This is a great process, and as I have said over the last couple of days we're going to keep working literally until the last vote is cast and counted,\\" she said. Clinton's campaign was hoping to narrow the gap with Sanders in New Hampshire, a state where she pulled off an unexpected victory over Barack Obama eight years ago. Democratic voters in New Hampshire made their choices earlier than Republicans, with more than half saying they decided more than a week ago, according to the exit polls. About 7 in 10 Democrats said they wanted a candidate who has experience in politics; about a quarter wanted someone outside the political establishment. The enthusiasm behind Trump, a real estate mogul who has never held political office, and Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, underscores the public's anger with the current political system. Even if neither candidate ultimately becomes his party's nominee, whoever does will have to reckon with the voter frustration they've tapped into. For Trump, New Hampshire is his state to lose. After a second place finish behind Cruz in Iowa last week, he accepted some of the more traditional trappings of presidential campaigns, including smaller town halls with voters. Still, he closed the final full day of campaigning with a vulgar insult of Cruz. The Texas senator brushed off Trump's comments, saying the reason the businessman engages in insults \\"is because he can't discuss the substance.\\" As voters trickled in to polling stations early Tuesday, the results seemed far from decisive. Seventy-two-year-old Republican John Starer said he made up his mind about five minutes before he cast his ballot for Cruz. He said he was torn between Cruz and Trump but didn't think Trump could be elected. \\"I think (Cruz is) about the only one who could possibly get elected as a Republican,\\" he said The large Republican field was winnowed after Iowa, but there remains a crowded grouping of more traditional candidates, including Rubio and the governors. Rubio appeared to be breaking away after a stronger-than-expected showing in Iowa, but he stumbled in Saturday's debate under intense pressure from Christie. The New Jersey governor has relentlessly cast the young senator as too inexperienced and too reliant on memorized talking points to become president. Rubio played into Christie's hands by responding with the same well-rehearsed line each time he was challenged by the governor. Rival campaigns hope the moment was enough to give voters pause. Megan Tolstenko, 33, an unaffiliated voter from Manchester, voted Tuesday for Christie, saying she thinks he would be best able to manage the country's defenses and the fight against the Islamic State group. Kasich, who has prided himself on avoiding attacks on his rivals, said he hoped New Hampshire voters were \\"fed up with the negative.\\" ___ Pace reported from Washington.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Poorly designed Product review: This bike rack is very poorly designed. I tried hauling 2 bikes for a 3 hour trip and the rack would not stayed flat against my car; it kept tilting. I ended up pulling off and going into REI to buy a Yakima that is the same type of rack. The Yakima never budged for the remainder of the trip. The problem with the rack is that it does not have side stabilizers only top and bottom. I thought that all racks of this type had side, top and bottom stabilizers. It may be okay for one light weight bike. A:","completion":"The given review is likely to significantly decrease the chances of you buying the product for several reasons. Firstly, the reviewer states that the product is \\"poorly designed\\" which suggests one or more design flaws that could impair usage and satisfaction. In this case, the bike rack's lack of side stabilizers is the obvious design flaw mentioned. This lack results in the rack not staying flat against the car and tilting. Additionally, the reviewer highlights the issue of the poorly designed bike rack through a real-life experience of trying to haul 2 bikes on a 3 hour trip. The review indicates the instability of the rack, given that it continued to tilt during the trip, eventually forcing the reviewer to stop their trip and buy an alternative product. The comparison with a different brand further accentuates the ineffectiveness of the product. The reviewer went into a store and decided to buy a Yakima rack of the same type, which did not budge for the remainder of the trip. The way the reviewer explicitly contrasts their experience with the Yakima rack suggests it is more reliable and efficient, serving its purpose without any issues. This could lead a potential buyer to look at the Yakima rack instead. Another important aspect is the limitation in terms of the load that the product can handle. The reviewer mentions that the rack might only be suitable for one lightweight bike. If a potential buyer is planning to transport multiple bikes or even a single heavy bike, this review would certainly decrease their likelihood of purchasing the product. Finally, reviews form a critical part of the decision-making process for consumers. They provide potential buyers with insight into the performance of the product based on the experiences of those who have already purchased and used it. In this case, the review is quite detailed and presents a negative image of the product, which will dissuade many potential buyers. In conclusion, after reading this review, the chances of purchasing this particular bike rack would decrease considerably due to its reported design flaw, poor performance in practice, unfavorable comparison with another brand, and limitations in its usage. Future buyers might be led to search for alternatives, particularly ones that can more securely transport more than one bike or heavier bikes."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire.

The glue was applied to the legs of the sofa but not the couch. That's because the Choose your answer from: (I) sofa legs were broken.. (II) couch legs were broken..","completion":"sofa legs were broken. As a result, the decision was made to focus on repairing the sofa before addressing any issues that may be present with the couch. The process of repairing the sofa legs began with a careful evaluation of the damage, which revealed that the legs had cracks and were not stable enough to support the weight of the sofa anymore. Thus, it was evident that the sofa legs required immediate reinforcement, and the best course of action was to use glue to hold them together for a strong bond. Before applying the glue, the surfaces of the sofa legs needed to be prepared. To ensure that the adhesive would create a durable bond, any dirt and debris were removed from the surfaces with a cloth, and they were then lightly sanded to create a textured area for the glue to adhere to. This step also allowed the removal of any weaker parts of the wood that could impede the bonding process of the glue. Once the surfaces were clean and properly prepared, a strong wood glue specifically designed for furniture repairs was chosen. This type of glue was selected due to its ability to create a bond that was not only long-lasting but also able to withstand the stress and weight that a sofa often encounters. It was crucial to adhere to the manufacturer's instructions in terms of application and drying time to ensure that the bond formed between the pieces was as strong as possible. The glue was carefully applied to the damaged areas of the sofa legs, along with adequate pressure to squeeze the pieces together. Doing so allowed any excess glue to seep out, helping to create a solid connection between the broken pieces. Clamps were used to hold the glued pieces together during the drying process, which typically lasts for around 24 hours. However, it's important to note that the clamps should not be overly tight, as this could potentially cause further damage to the cracked leg. While the couch was not in need of glue application at this point in time, it's crucial to monitor its condition and reassess whether any repairs are necessary in the future. The couch legs could potentially show signs of wear and tear, which would warrant similar attention and repair measures. Regular examination of furniture pieces prevents any underlying issues from getting worse and ultimately prolonging the lifespan of the furniture. In conclusion, the glue was applied to the legs of the sofa and not the couch due to the fact that the sofa legs were broken and required immediate repair. Through proper surface preparation, glue application, and adherence to the drying time, the sofa legs were successfully repaired and reinforced to continue supporting the weight of the sofa. The couch, on the other hand, did not display any signs of damage at this time, but it is essential to be vigilant in monitoring its condition in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mini's mother tells this story walking towards the railroad to receive Jack Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Tracks of Time\\" Act 1: In the busy town of Kinsley, we are introduced to a humble and joyful little 8-year-old, Mini. Mini's mother, Grace, a strong, fierce yet gentle woman of strength and perseverance, often tells stories that depict her past life adventures. These are not ordinary fairy tales or bedtime stories; they are real, full of life, emotions, trials, and triumphs that Grace had endured. One of these days, as they were walking towards the railroad to receive Jack, Grace's high school friend, Grace begins to share a story that feels different than the ones before. This time, the story appeared to have a part of Grace that was yet unexplored, the story of her youth and an unprofessed love. Act 2: The story is set around Grace's youth, being a teenager and discovering the joys and harshness of life. Jack, Grace's best friend, was her greatest companion during her tough times. They both shared a deep bond of understanding and friendship, an undying relation that was deeply rooted in trust and affection. Grace describes her and Jack's mischievous activities, their shared laughter, and the comfort they found in each other's company. Yet, Grace never dared to express her growing love for Jack, fearing it might ruin their friendship. Jack, on the other hand, seemed oblivious and stayed absorbed in his world, focusing majorly on his dream to become a train driver. As their days of youth turned into memories, Jack left the town to chase his dreams, leaving Grace behind. Though hurt, Grace respected Jack's decisions, accepted his absence, and moved on with her life. During their walk to the railway, Mini finds herself entwined in her mother’s story. Grace's smile when uttering Jack's name, the subtle change in her tone, and even the sadness in her eyes provide Mini a hint of the unvoiced love story. Act 3: As they reach the railway station, Grace concludes her story. She tells Mini how life moves on with or without the people we love, and that's what she did after Jack left. Time passed, and Grace got married, had Mini, but Jack's part in her life somehow remained vital. The day Jack contacted her announcing his return as a successful train driver, she knew she had to meet him. Now Grace sees Jack, not that clueless teenager anymore but a grown man who achieved his dream. Their reunion is quite emotional yet memorable. Jack is introduced to Mini, who is now as excited as her mother to meet her new uncle. As Jack, Grace, and Mini start spending time, Jack realises the feelings Grace had for him, which never faded even after so many years. A plot twist occurs when Jack confesses his love for Grace back in their youth days but never found the courage to express it. Act 4: The film ends in a bit of a bitter-sweet reality. Grace, now, has her family, a loving husband, and Mini, yet the story of her unspoken love becomes a memory that she shares with her daughter. The movie beautifully portrays that sometimes, love stories don’t have the typical happily-ever-after, yet they can teach someone as young as Mini about the essence of affection, friendship, sacrifice, and life. Grace's story of her silent love, cherished friendship, and unfulfilled dreams serves as an essential life lesson for Mini, who starts understanding the complexities of relationships and emotions at such a tender age. Mini's frequent walks toward the railroad become much more than just a meeting point but a path where ongoing stories of life are encountered, shaping her perception of the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Americans are ready to receive us foreigners at their homes, share their holidays, and their home life.They will enjoy welcoming us and be pleased if we accept their hospitality easily.

Columbia University paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant Adam Finch (Eric Christian Olsen) to investigate the discovery. They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near U.S. Outpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice. That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars' dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own. Derek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help. Kate discovers bloody dental fillings near a blood-soaked shower. She runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off. When it attempts to land, Griggs transforms into the Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains.

Question: Information: - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music. - EMI Records was a British record label founded by the music company of the same name in 1972 as its flagship label, and launched in January 1973 as the successor to its Columbia and Parlophone record labels. The label was later launched worldwide. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd. It was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and the US by Columbia Records on 4 April. - \`\` Cluster One '' , an instrumental , is the opening track on Pink Floyd 's 1994 album , The Division Bell .

The reason for this is that the term \\"derivative\\" generally implies a lack of originality or creativity, suggesting that the collection being referred to is unoriginal or copied from other sources.

When referring to a collection, whether it be an artistic body of work, a group of ideas, or a set of products, using the word \\"derivative\\" does not evoke a sense of excitement or intrigue. Instead, it gives the impression that the collection is not innovative and may not be worth exploring further. While it is, of course, possible to interpret sentiments subjectively, and some people might not perceive the term \\"derivative\\" as strongly negative, the general consensus is that it has a negative connotation.

The positive aspects mentioned in the review are related to the acting and the storyline. The mention of \\"solid acting\\" indicates that the reviewer appreciates the performances of the actors involved. They may have found the portrayals of the characters convincing, engaging, and emotionally impactful. The remark about having a \\"compelling storyline\\" suggests that the plot of the movie is interesting, thought-provoking, and well-constructed. The reviewer likely found the narrative engaging and was able to maintain interest in the events and developments throughout the film. On the other hand, the negative aspects of the review pertain to the editing and pacing of the movie. The statement \\"the editing and pacing could use some improvement\\" denotes that the reviewer found certain aspects of the movie's technical execution to be subpar or problematic. The editing process involves selecting and arranging shots and sequences in a film to effectively convey the desired narrative and emotional impact. Thus, the reviewer may have encountered issues such as awkward transitions between scenes, excessive or insufficient coverage of particular moments, or other inconsistencies in maintaining a coherent visual flow. The pacing refers to the rhythm, tempo, and progression of events in the movie. The reviewer's comment implies that the film might have lagged or rushed in certain sections, or did not provide a smoothly progressing narrative. This could mean that the movie may have had scenes that felt too slow or dragged on unnecessarily, while others might have been too abrupt or not given enough time to develop. To conclude, the overall opinion towards the movie presented in the review seems to be mixed. The reviewer appreciated the performances of the actors and found the storyline engaging, which indicate positive opinions. However, they also felt that the editing and pacing of the film could be better, suggesting a negative sentiment in those areas. The review does not explicitly lean towards a predominantly positive or negative opinion, but rather highlights both positive and negative aspects of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself .

As he chats to her, he is found by his aides and bundled by to the Palace.Lord Percival hears of the reunion and offers Miranda a sum of money to contact the King again, agree to go on a date, and pose for some photographs that could be used against him. She hesitates but agrees to the blackmail.Miranda and the King meet again, but Miranda can't go through with the deal and tries to hide him from the cameras. She tells Lord Percival that the deal is off - but Percival manages to get some photographs of them together anyway.Ralph receives a call from Miranda that they shouldn't see each other anymore. Heart-broken, Ralph decides to look at the prospect of Princess Anne (Joely Richardson) from Finland as a future bride. There is to be a lavish state banquet, and the King's aides prepare him for the big occassion - which will also bring in much needed manufacturing work to the country through a trade treaty.To throw a spanner in the works, Lord Percival invites Miranda to the banquet.At the meal, Ralph clumsily knocks over his glass, which causes a domino effect down...","completion":"In London, Ralph met a dancer by the name of Miranda (Camille Coduri) at an American strip club."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GPS (Global Positioning System) are both global satellite-based navigation systems that provide accurate positioning and timing information to users by receiving signals transmitted from their respective satellite constellations. However, there are some key differences between the two systems that can affect the efficiency and accuracy of navigation applications. GLONASS is a Russian-operated satellite positioning system, whereas GPS is operated by the United States. The two systems use different frequencies and satellite constellations to provide positioning information. The GLONASS satellite constellation consists of 24 operational satellites (with a few spares), while the GPS system has a constellation of 31 operational satellites. The main differences between GLONASS and GPS are as follows: 1. Coverage: GPS provides global coverage, with better positioning accuracy in North America and Europe due to its satellite constellation design. GLONASS is optimized for the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Russia, and provides slightly better accuracy in those areas compared to GPS. However, both systems provide global coverage and can be used together to enhance accuracy and precision of navigation applications. 2. Frequency bands: GPS operates at L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) bands, while GLONASS operates at L1 (1602 MHz) and L2 (1246 MHz) bands. The slight differences in frequency bands can impact the performance of receivers. However, modern multi-constellation receivers can handle signals from both systems efficiently. 3. Signal structure and accuracy: GLONASS uses Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) signal structure, while GPS uses Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signal structure. The use of FDMA in GLONASS results in slightly lower positioning accuracy compared to GPS, but the difference is generally not significant in most applications. Comparing GLONASS and GPS, it is difficult to declare one system as definitively better than the other since both systems have their unique characteristics, strengths, and limitations. In general, GPS may provide slightly better accuracy and performance due to its larger satellite constellation and CDMA signal structure. However, combining signals from both GLONASS and GPS satellites can further improve positioning accuracy and reliability, particularly in urban environments or areas with challenging terrains where satellite visibility may be limited. Regarding the multi-choice problem, would you say that these questions are the same? (b). yes The two questions are essentially asking a comparison between GLONASS and GPS and seeking an opinion on which is better.

Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure? Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Hint: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure.

By default, your computer starts up by reading the operating system information from its built-in hard drive. You can change this by telling it to prioritize plugged-in USB items over the built-in hard drive. The settings for your computers boot behavior are in a menu called the BIOS, which is a pre-startup menu you can access by pressing a key specific to your computer model as your computer turns on. In order to boot from a USB flash drive, the flash drive must be set up as a bootable item, and it must have a disk image (ISO) file with an operating system or similar service installed on it. The key that you press to access the BIOS varies depending on your computer manufacturer and model. You can look up your computer's BIOS key by typing your computer's manufacturer and model name, along with \\"bios key\\", into a search engine and reviewing the results, or you can consult your computer's manual if you still have it. Most computers use one of the function keys (e.g., F12) as the BIOS key, though some computers will use the Esc key or the Del key. The USB flash drive should plug into one of the rectangular USB ports on your computer's housing. On a laptop, the USB ports are typically on the sides of the housing, while desktop computers typically have the USB ports on the front or back of the tower. . If your flash drive isn't already bootable, use the Command Prompt or one of the Windows installation tools to make it so. Copy the ISO file you want to boot from by clicking it once and then pressing Ctrl+C, then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V to paste in the file. For example, if you're attempting to install or use Ubuntu Linux from the flash drive, you would paste the Ubuntu ISO file into the flash drive's window.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises when he retired in 2004?, using the article: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job.

Possible answers: i. yes ii. it is not possible to tell iii. no","completion":"iii. No. It does not logically follow that if \\"A man surfing a crashing wave,\\" then \\"The man is in a bathtub.\\" First, let's analyze the scenarios presented in the statements. In the first statement, \\"A man surfing a crashing wave,\\" we envision a man physically riding a surfboard on a large, powerful wave. Typically, this scenario takes place in a large body of water, such as the ocean. Surfing on crashing waves requires ample water, skill, and proper equipment, such as a surfboard. Moreover, the term \\"crashing wave\\" implies a forceful and dramatic event, which is usually associated with waves found in the ocean. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"The man is in a bathtub,\\" presents an entirely different scenario. Bathtubs are usually located in bathrooms and are relatively small in size when compared to bodies of water like oceans, which are required for surfing crashing waves. Bathtubs are designed for personal hygiene and relaxation purposes and do not provide the necessary conditions for surfing. The water in a bathtub is typically calm and does not generate powerful waves that would be suitable for surfing. Therefore, based on the information provided in the statements, \\"a man surfing a crashing wave\\" and \\"the man is in a bathtub\\" are two different scenarios that cannot logically be linked together. It does not make sense to conclude that a man surfing a crashing wave would be in a bathtub as bathtubs do not have the space or water conditions necessary for surfing. Thus, the most appropriate response is iii. No, it doesn't logically follow that if a man is surfing a crashing wave, then he is in a bathtub."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: While scanning parenting blogs and sites yesterday, I came across an article on Huffington Post about a restaurant receipt with a note from a “single mom.” I was initially a little amused that this was making the rounds because it seems so silly. Who really cares if someone, single mom or not, left a tip? It’s rude in the extreme, but hardly worthy of public discussion. The more I thought about it, though, I realized it wasn’t funny at all. The restaurant patron, who left no tip on a 138.55 bill, signing, “Single Mom, sorry,” may or may not have been a single mom. I think the diner was not really a single parent, or at least not one who couldn’t afford a tip, but rather someone trying to imply that some single moms feel like they are entitled to a pass because they are struggling financially. The note on the receipt (if it was indeed a joke), and the reaction it has drawn online, points to a larger issue. Increasingly, it seems, single moms are being used as the butt of jokes or, even worse, a scapegoat for societal ills. What do you think? Is this receipt real? Is the incident indicative of a larger, mostly negative, attitude toward single mothers? Related content: Momspeak: Who speaks for the single parent? Debate over AU professor should be about supporting working parents, not breast-feeding ||||| A photo of a receipt allegedly left by a single mother at a restaurant has gone viral after it was originally posted on Reddit. The bill shows a charge for a 138.35 meal with no additional tip. Instead, there's a note that reads \\"single mom sorry\\" -- implying that whoever signed the bill doesn't have enough money because it is expensive to raise kids alone. Redditor PhoenixSongFawkes posted the photo and wrote, \\"I'm sure 140 could have gotten you and your kids a week worth of groceries, but instead you spend it one one meal?! For shame!\\" (Story continues below photo.) Commenters, including many single moms, were outraged. RedheadedBanshee wrote, \\"I'm a single Mom, and this is bullshit. What exactly are you teaching your kids? ... Dear Parents of all kinds - your kids are watching you and learning.\\" Dozens of commenters suggested that if a person -- single mom or not -- can't afford to leave a tip, that she shouldn't have gone out to eat at all and that whoever left this note is in the wrong. Lindsay Cross, a blogger for Mommyish and former single mom, has another theory. Cross doesn't believe that the receipt is legitimate. \\"It’s completely possible that someone wanted to be an asshole and blame it on single moms. Honestly, the more I think about how anyone would do this to a waitress, the more I think it’s likely that this was just a very awful prank to make single moms look bad,\\" she wrote. Though Cross makes it apparent that she isn't trying to stereotype single moms, she notes that moms who raise kids on their own are generally sympathetic to those in service positions and mostly try to help those who are working hard. But on the other hand, as Cross and many commenters argued, \\"jerks\\" come in all shapes and sizes.

Both men are wearing black hoodies: This does not provide any direct information about whether they are attending a bonfire or not, but it is worth noting as context. 3. One of the men is smoking a cigarette: This detail is not mentioned in the statement, but it could imply a casual setting, which might be associated with a bonfire.

In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that recorded with the Hawks?, using the article: After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals. In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks' nearby house, \\"Big Pink\\". These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for Julie Driscoll and the Brian Auger Trinity (\\"This Wheel's on Fire\\"), The Byrds (\\"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\\", \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\"), and Manfred Mann (\\"Mighty Quinn\\"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.

Options: - movies - idaho - university - cafe - universe The answer is \\"cafe\\" because The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"cafe\\" because a cafe is an establishment that caters specifically to providing coffee, sandwiches, and other beverages and light meals to its patrons in a comfortable atmosphere. The other options mentioned do not exclusively serve as places where people can enjoy a cup of coffee and a sandwich, as they have different primary functions. Here is a detailed analysis of the other options: 1. Movies: Although movies, or more accurately, movie theaters, do offer a range of refreshments and snacks, their primary purpose is to showcase films for people to watch. The choice of food and beverages available in movie theaters is usually limited, and they may not always offer coffee or sandwiches. Furthermore, a movie theater is designed for communal viewing experiences, and the main focus will always be on the film being shown, rather than on facilitating a relaxed environment for enjoying a cup of coffee and a sandwich. 2. Idaho: Idaho is a state in the United States that contains a variety of food establishments, including cafes, restaurants, and bars. However, Idaho is a geographical area and not a specific place where one can have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. It does not directly compare to a cafe, which is a designated food and beverage establishment. 3. University: A university is an institution of higher education and research focused on teaching, learning, and research. Although universities may have cafes, restaurants, or food courts on their campus, the primary purpose of a university is not to provide a space for people to have coffee or sandwiches; it exists to provide education and facilitate research. The presence of cafes or food establishments at a university is to cater to the needs of students, faculty, and staff, as well as visitors, but they are not the main focus of the institution. 4. Universe: The universe refers to the totality of space, matter, time, energy, and various phenomena that have been observed and analyzed by scientists and astronomers. Including everything that exists from galaxies to subatomic particles, the universe is not a suitable place for humans to have a cup of coffee or a sandwich, as it does not refer to a specific location or establishment designed to offer these items. In conclusion, out of the options provided, a cafe stands out as the most appropriate answer because it specifically caters to offering coffee, sandwiches, and other food and beverages in a comfortable environment. While some of the other options may have food establishments within them, their primary focus is not to provide people with a place to have a cup of coffee or a sandwich. Therefore, the most suitable answer is \\"cafe.\\""},{"prompt":"In this task, you're given a context, a question, three options, and an answer.

Families SA considered the parenting skills of Chloe Valentine's drug-using teenage mother to be 'good enough' despite evidence of neglect, an inquest has heard. Chloe was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. An inquest into the girl's death has heard her short life was marred by horrific squalor and chronic neglect but she was never removed from her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Scroll down for video. Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012. Social worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest on Wednesday she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Chloe's teenage mother allowed the 18-month-old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods, despite being warned by Ms Stewart that this was not acceptable. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. An inquest into Chloe's death heard that social workers knew that her mother, drug user Ashley Polkinghorne, was neglecting her daughter from 18-months-old. Chloe died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a motorbike over a three-day period. Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish-strewn house, Ms Stewart said. Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, questioned why Ms Stewart was excusing Polkinghorne's behaviour, saying her obligation was to protect infant Chloe. 'She was a teenager with a baby,' Ms Kereru said. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months. Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012. 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother, aren't you?' 'That's what you just did.' Ms Stewart denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations, saying it took time for parents such as Polkinghorne to make sustained changes. Polkinghorne, now 22, and a later partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest continues.

Some people who were supposed to help children like Chloe didn't do their job very well, and they let Chloe stay with her mommy even though she was not a good mommy. There is a meeting happening now, called an inquest, to find out why those people didn't do a better job to protect Chloe.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Charlie Chaplin was one of the greatest and most widely loved silent movie stars. From Easy Street (1917) to Modern Times (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He is best known for his character \\"the little tramp \\". It is this kind-hearted character that we connect with the time of silent movies. Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914, Chaplin made his first short film, Making a Living. That same year, he made thirty-four more short films. These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was extremely good at it. Chaplin was known as one of the most demanding men in Hollywood. No matter how big or tiny the size of the part, Chaplin walked each actor through every scene. Chaplin knew that a successful scene wasn't simply about the star, but about everyone on the screen. He required that all the actors and actresses work together in every performance. The only way to achieve it was to keep complete control over every scene. As he became more popular, he used more and more creative and difficult filming techniques. Movies such as his 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, required endless reworking of scenes and rebuilding of sets. Though Chaplin is of the silent movie era, his achievements were carried over into the films of today. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new and more wonderful cinema. Chaplin's working life in entertainment lasted over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88. A:","completion":"Which statement about Charlie Chaplin is true according to the article? A. Chaplin was born in London and first visited America in 1925. B. His character \\"the little tramp\\" was not popular among silent movie fans. C. Chaplin was known to be demanding towards actors and was focused on perfecting each scene. D.

Answer the above question based on the context below: After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it. However, Dortmunder cannot access the box because of bank vault security, and the gang leaves Abe in Dr. Amusa's office while they come up with a plan.

Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? Options: - Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. - not enough information - They will be enrolled in a study. - They will call their doctor. === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: The movie opens with Gotham City celebrating the new high-tech Bat-Signal's unveiling ceremony. During this event, the city officials and the police force are gathered to pay tribute to Batman for his heroic fight against crime that has slowly turned the city around. As District Attorney, Harvey Dent attends the ceremony as the city's most outspoken advocate for justice. While at the event, he stumbles upon a mysterious note hidden inside the Bat-Signal's control box. The cryptic message reads, \\"The blind eye of justice hides in the darkness of Gotham's soul.\\" Intrigued by the enigmatic nature of the note, Harvey Dent becomes adamant about discovering the identity of its author and the message's true meaning. He enlists the help of his ally, Jim Gordon, and together they begin an investigation. Act 2: Gordon and Dent uncover that the note's author has intimate knowledge of Gotham's most notorious criminals. The message serves as a code that leads them to a secret network of organized crime that has been orchestrating chaos for years, hidden from public view. As the duo delves deeper, physical evidence and hidden messages from the mysterious author lead them to dangerous encounters with mob bosses, corrupt officials, and masked criminals, taking the pair on a treacherous path through the darkest corners of Gotham. Throughout their investigation, Harvey Dent starts to struggle with his own moral compass. His concept of black-and-white justice begins to blur as he finds himself in questionable situations and making difficult decisions, all in the name of fighting evil. As the story progresses, Harvey's duality intensifies, reflecting the same complexities present in his hometown. Act 3: In the thrilling climax, Dent and Gordon uncover a secret society of powerful individuals running Gotham's criminal underworld and the political scene, with the mysterious author at its helm. Confronting this twisted villain, the author reveals he has been testing Harvey Dent's moral integrity all along, wanting to expose the flaws in Gotham's justice system. Feeling betrayed by the city he vowed to protect, Harvey's internal conflict reaches its peak. As his dual personalities collide, Two-Face emerges, symbolizing the unresolvable duality of Gotham and its broken justice system. In the end, Batman steps in to help Gordon stop Harvey Dent, who has now become Two-Face. Batman painfully apprehends his former ally, who has fallen to the dark side of corruption, while simultaneously dismantling the secret society behind Gotham's chaos. Through the dark journey into Gotham's soul, our protagonists learn that the struggle between good and evil is never-ending. The movie concludes with Batman's promise to always work tirelessly to protect the city, even if the corruption he fights may very well consume those he trusts the most."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:By 1992, the city was in such dire need of improvement that it was losing jobs, population, and even air carriers to more attractive cities. With this in mind, Mayor Ron Norick pushed through a massive plan for capital improvements throughout downtown called the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan, or MAPS. MAPS called for a five-year, one-cent sales tax to fund a new ballpark, a canal through Bricktown, a new central library, a large indoor arena, renovations to the fairgrounds and the civic center, and a series of low water dams on the North Canadian River to make it attractive and accessible to small boats.

Choices: 1. yes. 2. no.","completion":"2. no. The statement provided, \\"She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage,\\" does not answer the question about the year that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle. Instead, it refers to a separate event involving Queen Victoria taking a drive and visiting gardens in London. To answer the question, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in the year 1852. Balmoral Castle is a private residence of the British royal family and serves as a holiday retreat where they spend time during the summer months. The Queen and her husband, Prince Albert, discovered the castle and the surrounding area in 1848 and quickly fell in love with the location. They decided to purchase the Balmoral estate, which at the time was a relatively small and humble hunting lodge. Within a few years, from 1853 to 1856, they commissioned the construction of a new, larger castle in the Scottish Baronial architecture style, designed by architect William Smith. Since then, Balmoral Castle has served as a personal and private residence for the British royal family, providing an escape from the formal obligations of the London life. Many royals find solace, peace, and tranquility in the beautiful Scottish Highlands surrounding the castle. Over the years, Balmoral has been expanded and improved with added facilities such as cottages, lodges, and even a private church. To recap, the year in which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle was 1852, and the statement provided about visiting the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society and taking a carriage ride in London does not answer the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. and a hint : Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Please answer this question : Would car A emit less or more carbon monoxide than car B? Answer:","completion":"Car A would emit less carbon monoxide than car B. Step 1: Identify the presence of a catalytic converter in each car. Car A: Has a catalytic converter. Car B: Does not have a catalytic converter.

Animals may fight, make threatening sounds, and act aggressively toward members of the same species. These behaviors usually occur as the result of Choose your answer from: [a]. competition; [b]. conservation; [c]. decomposition; [d]. pollution; Your answer:","completion":"[a]. competition; Animals may fight, make threatening sounds, and act aggressively toward members of the same species as a result of competition. There are various factors that may lead to competitive behaviors among animals. These factors include, but are not limited to, competition for resources, mating opportunities, and territory. Understanding the reasons for these behaviors can give insight into the lives of animals and their social dynamics. 1. Competition for resources: The most fundamental reason for aggressive behaviors among animals is competition for limited resources, such as food, water, and shelter. As resources in the environment are finite, animals of the same species often find themselves competing for the same necessities in order to meet their needs and ensure survival. This competition can lead to physical confrontations, posturing, and vocal displays meant to establish dominance and deter rivals. 2. Mating opportunities: Animals may also display aggressive behaviors to gain access to potential mates. Mating is crucial for the survival of a species, as it ensures the continuation of genetic traits and the possibility for offspring. Individuals that are successful in securing mates and producing offspring thus have higher chances of contributing their genes to the following generation. This can result in sexual selection, where certain traits, behaviors, and displays become more common because those individuals possessing them are more likely to reproduce. Male animals, in particular, may engage in displays, ritualized combat, or physical contests to secure a female and reproduce. 3. Territorial defense: Territory plays a significant role in the survival and reproductive success of many animal species. By establishing and defending territories, animals can secure exclusive access to resources, mates, and ideal nesting or denning sites. Animals may use aggressive behaviors to defend their territories from rivals, displaying aggression through vocalizations, posture, marking, and other signs. In some cases, confrontations may escalate to physical altercations, often with the intent to drive the rival away or establish dominance. Generally, the advantages of having a territory outweigh the risks and costs of these aggressive behaviors. Aggressive behaviors and conflict are natural aspects of animal life, driven by the need to secure resources, mates, and territory. Competition and aggression have significant impacts on the social structures and overall dynamics of many animal species, shaping their evolutionary history and influencing their behaviors. While these behaviors may seem harsh or violent, they ultimately serve to ensure the survival and successful reproduction of the individuals involved, thereby supporting the continuation of their species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Dogs learn best through positive reinforcement and they quickly learn the best way to get it. Every time your dog is able to go to the bathroom in his designated spot, reward him with a little treat, lots of praise, and a scratch on the head. You can, of course, reward your dog for other things, like learning how to sit and stay. All good behavior should be rewarded. When you're treating your dog for going to the bathroom in his spot, give him a treat and praise right after he finishes relieving himself. Don't give it too early or too late, or he won't associate it with going to the bathroom in the right spot. Some people have had success using the bell method instead of a treat. When your dog goes to the bathroom in his spot, you ring a bell or pleasant-sounding chime as part of his reward. The dog will come to look forward to the sound of the chime, which should only be used in this specific situation. The drawback here is that, eventually, you won't want to keep using a chime or bell every time your dog goes to the bathroom. Initially phasing it out might be confusing to the dog. Whenever you're taking your dog to the bathroom or talking about it, keep your voice light and pleasant. Never raise your voice or take on a menacing tone, because your dog will start to associate his bodily functions with punishment and fear. If your dog makes a mess inside, you can withhold praise, but don't yell at the dog or make him feel ashamed. If using verbal cues, such as \\"outside\\", \\"go potty\\", or \\"good dog\\" be consistent. The repetition of these words along with the action and environment will reinforce where you want your dog to relieve himself. Dogs don't respond well to punishment. It scares them and instead of learning to perform well for you, they learn to fear you. Never yell, hit, or do anything that could cause your dog to feel afraid. Do not rub your dog's face in his mess. Contrary to some beliefs, this does not teach a dog not to go to the bathroom in the house. The dog will not understand what you're doing and you'll just end up scaring him. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes that dogs learn best through positive reinforcement, and it is essential to reward good behavior, such as going to the bathroom in the designated spot or learning new commands. It is important to give the reward and praise immediately after the dog completes the desired action so that the dog can make the proper association. Some people use the bell method as a form of reward, but phasing it out can be confusing for the dog. When training your dog, use a light and pleasant voice and never raise it or use a menacing tone, as this can lead to associating bodily functions with punishment and fear. If the dog makes a mess indoors, withhold praise but do not yell or make the dog feel ashamed. Consistency in verbal cues and repetition helps reinforce desired behavior.

Which 2016 Presidential Potential Had the Best 2014? The 2014 election isn’t over yet, but 2016 loomed over the campaign trail as presidential potentials made their way across the country in the role of surrogates. So who played that role the best in the last few months? Michael Steele, the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that in terms of 2014, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R) has had the best year. “He’s got the organization on the ground right now. He’s in all 50 states. He’s got young folks gravitating towards him. He’s got African-Americans taking a pause and looking at him.” NBC Political Analyst Joe Scarborough agreed that Paul is talented and that he’s going to run a better campaign than his father but, “He’s not going to win because Main Street Republicans win and you’ve got two choices that we talked about here, Jeb or Chris Christie.” And he had a different take on who has had the best 2014. “Without a doubt, Mitt Romney, Mitt was right on Russia. Mitt was right on Iraq,” said the MSNBC host. As for the Democratic side, the panel agreed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has some more work to do. “I don’t know how you lose a book tour. That’s a hard thing to lose, but she’s got plenty of time to regroup,” said NBC’s Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell. Former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs concurred. \\"I don't think she's had a particularly good run with the book. I wouldn't have done as many interviews as she did.

Fold the top edge down to the center so that the edge rests along the line from the previous fold. Do the same with the bottom edge so that both edges of the paper meet in the center. Then open the sheet of paper again. The paper should now have one line going diagonally across and three horizontal lines dividing the paper into quarters. Fold them to the line from the last step, the horizontal line closest to the top. The corners will make a right triangle when properly folded; the bottom of that triangle should sit on the horizontal line, and the diagonal line from the first step should cut the triangle exactly in half. Repeat the same motion as above: bring the top corner of the paper down to the horizontal line, and fold it so that it forms a triangle whose base sits on that line. However, this time you will have an obtuse rather than a right triangle. The base of this triangle should be the same crease that was the hypotenuse of the right triangle, above. After this step, the overall shape of the paper should be a rectangle half the size of the original square. However, there should be triangular holes from where the corners were folded over. This time, use one of the other corners - if you folded in the top right and bottom left corners in the previous steps, this time use the bottom right corner. Bring the corner to the top center of the rectangle, forming a right triangle as tall as the rectangle. Pick the corner opposite the one you just folded - the only corner that has not yet been folded - and mirror the last step with this corner, bringing it to the bottom center of the rectangle. The fold should form another right triangle adjacent to the one from the previous step. Unfold the two triangles you just folded. Using the bottom right corner again (the one you just unfolded), refold the exact same fold, but this time, rather than folding it on top of the flap of paper from the double-folded corner, slide it underneath. Refold and the top left corner to the center, but this time tuck it under the flap from the double-folded, bottom left corner. Your paper should now be in the shape of a parallelogram, with each corner folded into another so that the whole piece holds together. The back should be smooth (no papers tucked in anywhere) and should have two lines cutting it in half, one horizontal and one diagonal (parallel to the sides). The bottom right should be one of the \\"pointy\\" corners (an acute angle). Fold it to the top right corner, so that the tip meets the angle of the top right corner (an obtuse angle). Essentially, you're folding the vertical side in half, but since it's a parallelogram, not a rectangle, it looks like you're folding in a corner. The bottom of the triangle created by the fold should sit at a right angle to the vertical sides of the parallelogram. Fold the top left hand corner to the bottom center. The paper should now be a perfect square. Unfold the last two folds you made so that the sides stick straight out from the square base, rather than laying flat atop it. Each of these will form one side of the cube, with the two triangles sticking off at right angles serving to connect each side to the rest. You started with six squares of paper, so you should have six folded squares in total. Different color paper was use in this example to clarify the visual instructions.

Gone are the days of manual labor-intensive tasks, as this versatile piece of equipment can chop, slice, grind, blend, and mix. The possibilities are endless when you start using it. One common question among novice food processor users is how much food and liquid they should use when operating the appliance. In this article, we will cover the basics of using your food processor, including adding the right quantities of both and making some delicious recipes. The Basics: Food and Liquid Measurements When using a food processor for the first time, it is vital to understand the importance of proper measurements. For optimal performance and best results, it is recommended that you place up to 1 cup (236.58 milliliters) of food in the food processor. This ensures that the appliance has enough space for efficient chopping and mixing. Adding liquids to a food processor is another essential aspect of its operation. You should add up to 3 tablespoons (44.36 milliliters) of a liquid, such as water or oil, as needed. Including the appropriate amount of liquid helps the food processor blend and mix ingredients effectively, generating the desired consistency in your recipes. Getting Creative in the Kitchen Now that you know the basics, it's time to experiment and explore the different recipes and ingredients that you can whip up using your food processor. 1. Homemade Pesto Combine fresh basil leaves (about 2 cups), 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup of pine nuts, 1/2 cup of olive oil, and three cloves of garlic in the food processor. Process the ingredients until smooth and well-combined. This homemade pesto is perfect for pasta dishes or as a spread for bruschetta. 2. Fresh Guacamole Place 2 ripe avocados, 1/4 cup of chopped onion, 1/4 cup of chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 1 minced garlic clove, and the juice of one lime into the food processor. Process until the consistency is slightly chunky, and you have yourself a delicious, fresh bowl of guacamole. 3. Almond Butter Roast 2 cups of almonds in a 180°C (350°F) preheated oven for 10 minutes. Place them in the food processor along with 1-2 tablespoons of neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola) and process until smooth. Homemade almond butter can be easily customized with honey or maple syrup. 4. Cauliflower Rice Roughly chop 1 head of cauliflower and place it into the food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower reaches a rice-like texture. This low-carb alternative to rice can be cooked like traditional rice or used in recipes like stir-fries, burritos, or sushi. Conclusion Food processors have become an indispensable kitchen tool for both professional chefs and home cooks. Properly measuring your ingredients will help ensure consistent results and avoid overloading the appliance. With a little creativity and understanding of your food processor's capabilities, you can save time and effort in the kitchen, all while preparing tasty and healthier dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3].

They are conspicuously different from the other reduviids by their very slender body form. They are stalking, predatory insects that can be collected on palm fronds, cliffs, spider webbing, or near lights at night (many can be collected by blacklight). They walk on their mid and hind legs; the front pair is raptorial. Some groups specialize on spiders. Very little is known about emesines except that many species are found in the tropics. Pedro Wygodzinsky wrote the most recent revision of this group. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Pseudometapterus is a little - known genus of thread - legged bug in the subfamily Emesinae . Members of the genus occur in North America and usually have wings that are extremely small or absent entirely , though a winged form of P. umbrosus is known from Southern Illinois . - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are slightly unusual overall, but very common among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable; they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis. - The tropics are a region of the Earth surrounding the equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun is at a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point). - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The term raptorial implies much the same as \\"predatory\\", but most often refers to modifications of an arthropod's foreleg that make it function for the grasping of prey while it is consumed, where the gripping surfaces are formed from the opposing faces of two successive leg segments (see illustration). This is distinctly different from the grasping mechanism of a structure such as a scorpion's claw (a \\"chela\\") in which one of the opposing surfaces is an articulated digit, and not a leg segment. While this is most widely known in mantises, similarly modified legs can be found in some crustaceans (e.g., mantis shrimp), and various insect families, such as Mantispidae, Belostomatidae, Nepidae, and Naucoridae (all members of these groups have raptorial forelegs). There are numerous other lineages within various insect families that have raptorial forelegs, most commonly seen in the family Reduviidae, but also including several different families of flies, and a few thrips.

Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school' in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me. It' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister.

Movie plot title: Without a Trace Movie plot: Susan Selky is a well-known English professor at Columbia University. She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her 10-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a 14-year-old male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop...

If you don't want to approach the guy directly, talk to other people who know him or the girl he likes. Check to see if they're dating yet, so you can decide if it's a good idea to try to date him yourself. For instance, try asking a mutual friend this question: \\"Hey, you know Chris? Is he dating Jess?\\" If you're on speaking terms with the guy, ask him about her. You could poke around to see if he plans on asking her out or if he just thinks she's cute. That way, you can figure out if it's a good idea to start dating him or not. For example, you could say, \\"So you think Rachel is cute? Are you thinking about asking her out?\\" If he's planning on asking her out, you may not want to get involved. He may be too emotionally invested in this other girl to really pay attention to you. If you don't want to ask him directly, look for clues. If he spends a lot of time with her and talks about her a lot, he may be getting ready to ask her out. Even if the guy likes the other girl and they're dating, that doesn't mean he can't date other people. If both he and the girl agree on it, they may both be seeing other people. You can ask the guy outright or check around to find out more. For instance, you could ask the guy, \\"Are you two still seeing other people?\\" You don't want to be the girl who tries to break up a couple so you can date the guy. For one, if you succeed, you may end up in a relationship where the guy doesn't trust you. After all, you did break them up. But, more importantly, it's the right thing to do. Until he breaks up with her or vice versa, consider him off-limits. Even if you think you're meant for each other, keep in mind this person has flaws like anyone else.

A competing team called Omega did research on the human genome. Team Omega lost. But I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

How is \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation.\\" said in Russian?","completion":"In Russian, the sentence \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation\\" can be translated as \\"Архивные файлы распаковываются во время установки.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the sentence: 1. Архивные (arhivnye) - This is the adjective form of the word \\"архив\\" (archive) and it means \\"archive\\" or \\"archival\\" in English. It's used in this sentence to describe the files as archive files. In Russian adjectives agree in gender, number, and case with the noun they modify. In this case, \\"архивные\\" agrees with the plural noun \\"файлы\\". 2. файлы (faily) - This is the plural form of the noun \\"файл\\" (file), which translates to \\"files\\" in English. This word is the main subject of the sentence, and it refers to the archive files being unpacked. 3. распаковываются (raspakovyvayutsya) - This is the verb \\"распаковывать\\" (to unpack) in its reflexive form \\"распаковываться\\". It is used in the 3rd person plural form, since the subject of the sentence is plural ('files'). The reflexive form is used because the action of the unpacking is happening to the files themselves. 4. во время (vo vremya) - This is a prepositional phrase that translates to \\"during\\" or \\"at the time of\\" in English. It's used here to express the timing of the action - i.e., when the unpacking of the archive files occurs. 5. установки (ustanovki) - This is the genitive form of the noun \\"установка\\" (installation). The genitive case is used here to indicate that the action of the verb (unpacking) is happening during the time of installation. Putting everything together, the sentence \\"Архивные файлы распаковываются во время установки\\" is a correct translation of \\"Archive files are unpacked during installation\\" in Russian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's examine each of these options. Option 1: Bag A bag can be a good place to store an eyeglasses case; however, bags are often taken out of the home (e.g., to work, school, shopping), so they may not always be immediately available inside the house. Option 2: Desk Storing an eyeglasses case on a desk can work, but there is a risk of it getting lost or pushed aside among other items on the desk, especially if the desk is cluttered. Option 3: Drawer A drawer offers a dedicated space to keep an eyeglasses case safe, protected, and easily accessible. It also helps to maintain a decluttered environment, as the case is stored out of sight when not in use. Option 4: Shirt pocket This option is not practical for an extra eyeglasses case, as shirt pockets are only temporary and highly dependent on whether you're wearing a shirt with a pocket. Additionally, a pocket does not provide much protection for the case. Option 5: Car A car can serve as a convenient place to store an eyeglasses case for emergencies; however, it is not within the confines of a home, which is the location specified in the question. Step 2: Compared the options and justify the reasoning Comparing the options, a drawer is the most fitting option for storing an extra eyeglasses case in a home, as it offers a dedicated, secure, and easily accessible storage place while keeping the home environment tidy.

Instead of helping, the other girls ridicule and harass her, throwing out tampons, sanitary towels and toilet paper to her. Teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) rushes in to stop the commotion. White, who appears to be bottling extreme rage, snaps a light bulb. After questioning Carrie, Miss Collins realizes that Carrie is unaware of the concept of menstruation. Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma. Upon her way home, Carrie uses her recently discovered telekinesis to stop a boy from teasing her. While at home, Carrie is tormented by her delusional mother (Piper Laurie), who locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray--she believes that Carrie received her period due to sinning.Miss Collins, still livid about the incident, berates the other girls and forces them through a detention, deliberately physically exhausting them. The leader of the clique, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), refuses to participate, and as punishment, is banned from the upcoming prom. Furious, she blames Carrie for her misfortune. Meanwhile, another one of the girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feels guilty about her part in teasing Carrie, so she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom.

Question: suppose less water seeps into rocks happens, how will it affect range of motion is caused by muscles. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The question involves two distinct concepts: the process of muscle contraction and the influence of water seepage in rocks. It's essential to address these concepts separately before evaluating any potential connections between them. First, let's examine the process of muscle contraction as outlined in your question. Muscle contraction occurs due to electrical signals in the brain that travel through nerves to muscles. Within the muscles, two types of proteins exist in filaments: actin and myosin. When the brain instructs the filaments to move, the motion of these filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract. This process is facilitated by the presence of opposing pairs of muscles, which allow for the necessary range of motion during body movements. Now, let's consider the concept of water seepage in rocks. In geological formations, water seeps into rocks and other porous surfaces. The effect of this water infiltration on the rocks depends on various factors such as the rock type, the rate of water flow, and the overall environmental conditions. Now, let us explore the possible relationship between these two concepts. In the context of this question, it is implied that there may be a connection between water seepage in rocks and the range of motion caused by muscles. However, there isn't any direct correlation between these two events. Water seepage in rocks primarily affects geological structures, whereas the range of motion caused by muscles is primarily a biological process. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation of less water seeping into rocks would have no effect on the range of motion caused by muscles. Similarly, this perturbation would not influence the opposing pairs of muscles that provide the necessary range of motion. The biological mechanisms responsible for muscle contraction, shortening, and range of motion remain unaffected by geological processes or changes related to water seepage in rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: People buy tickets on November 28 for the record Powerball jackpot, which swelled to 587.6 million. (CNN) -- The second Powerball ticket holder in last month's record jackpot has come forward to claim winnings worth nearly 200 million before taxes, the Arizona Lottery said Friday. \\"It is difficult to express just how thankful we are for this wonderful gift,\\" said the winner, a married man in his 30s whom the lottery said it would not identify publicly, at his request. \\"We are extremely grateful and feel fortunate to now have an increased ability to support our charities and causes. Obviously, this has been incredibly overwhelming, and we have always cherished our privacy.\\" The message directed reporters to the law firm Rhoads & Sinon LLP in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which did not immediately return a call on Friday night. The winner lives in Fountain Hills, northeast of Phoenix, said Karen Bach, director of budget, communications and products at the Arizona Lottery. He and his wife relocated there about a year ago from Pennsylvania and had played Powerball in Arizona only twice, she said. The 587.6 million jackpot from the November 28 drawing had a cash option of 384.7 million before taxes. The Arizona winner has opted to take cash, 192.5 million, before taxes. Fake lottery winner may be Facebook's most shared photo On the day of the drawing, he went to 4 Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, \\"handed the clerk a 20 bill and he said, 'I'd like 10 in Quick Pick Powerball tickets,'\\" she told reporters. \\"The retailer tried to encourage him to spend the entire 20 and he said, 'No, 10 is all I want to spend.' Clearly, that was enough.\\" He left his ticket overnight on the sun visor in his vehicle and retrieved it the next day, after he and his wife heard there had been a winner in Arizona. Then they compared the numbers on the ticket against those posted on the lottery website, she said. \\"They checked the numbers over and over again and were just absolutely shocked,\\" Bach said. Since then, the couple has assembled a legal and financial team to guide them through the process and began meeting with them on Monday, going so far as to use a whiteboard to write down how they wanted to allocate their newfound assets, Bach said. Columns on the whiteboard included entries for financial, legal and \\"fun,\\" she said. The couple opted to claim the prize before the end of the year \\"because of concerns over the fiscal cliff in 2013,\\" she said. The winnings are to be awarded on about December 14, said Jeff Hatch-Miller, executive director of the Arizona Lottery. Hatch-Miller, who met Friday morning with the winner in a hotel suite in Scottsdale, said the winner likes what he does and has no immediate plans to change it. \\"The winner said, 'You know, I like my job; I'd like to continue working my job,'\\" Hatch-Miller said. He described the man's work as \\"just a regular job, like yours or mine -- it's not a high-level job.\\" The winner's anonymity is not likely to last. A spokeswoman for the Arizona Lottery, Cindy Esquer, said it would release his name on Monday to news organizations that file Freedom of Information Act requests for it. Two winners from Missouri claimed their half of the jackpot on November 30. The prize is considered income by the IRS, meaning that the highest federal tax rate of 35% will apply. Each winner would therefore owe 67 million to the IRS, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at tax research firm CCH, in an interview last month. State taxes will also apply. In Arizona, a resident who has the winning ticket will be charged a 5% tax on the prize money. If a non-resident bought the winning ticket, a 6% rate will apply. The resulting tax bill will be either 10 million or 11 million, according to CCH. Ohio cops share 1million Powerball prize Missouri charges residents and non-residents a 4% tax, making the tax liability there nearly 8 million. Taking both state and federal taxes into consideration means the Arizona winner would owe up to 78 million in taxes and take home 114 million. The Missouri winner's tax bill would total about 75 million, leaving a take of 117.5 million. However, in either case, the amount paid in state taxes could likely be deducted on the winners' federal tax returns, lowering the overall tax liability slightly.","completion":"\\"Privacy-Cherishing Couple Claims 200M Share of Record 587.6M Powerball Jackpot\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Lata Mangeshkar ( pronunciation ) (born 28 September 1929) is an Indian playback singer and occasional music composer. She is one of the best-known and most respected playback singers in India. She has recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and has sung songs in over thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages, though primarily in Marathi and Hindi. She is the recipient of three National Film Awards, 12 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. Context: In the 1950s, Mangeshkar sang songs composed by various music directors of the period, including Anil Biswas (in films such as Tarana and Heer), Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad Ali, S. D. Burman, Pandit Amarnath Husan Lal Bhagat Ram (in films like Bari Behan, Meena Bazaar, Afsana, Aadhi Raat, Ansoo, Chhoti Bhabi, Adal-e-Jehangir), C. Ramchandra, Hemant Kumar, Salil Chowdhury, Khayyam, Ravi, Sajjad Hussain, Roshan, Kalyanji-Anandji, Vasant Desai, Sudhir Phadke, Hansraj Behl, Madan Mohan, and Usha Khanna. She made her debut in Tamil playback singing with Vanaradham in 1956 (Uran Khotala dubbed in Tamil) with the Tamil song \\"Enthan Kannalan\\" picturised on Nimmi in the dubbed version composed by Naushad. Mangeshkar sang many raga-based songs for Naushad in movies such as Deedar (1951), Baiju Bawra (1952), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955) and Mother India (1957). Ae Chorre Ki Jaat Badi Bewafa, a duet with G. M. Durrani, was her first song for composer, Naushad. The duo, Shankar-Jaikishan, chose Mangeshkar for Barsaat (1949), Aah (1953), Shree 420 (1955) and Chori Chori (1956). Before 1957, composer S. D. Burman chose Mangeshkar as the leading female singer for his musical scores in Sazaa (1951), House No. 44 (1955), and Devdas (1955). However a rift developed between Lata and Burman in 1957, and Lata did not sing Burman's compositions again until 1962. Mangeshkar won a Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer for Salil Chowdhury's composition \\"Aaja Re Pardesi\\" from Madhumati (1958). In the early fifties, Lata Mangeshkar's association with C. Ramchandra produced songs in movies such as Albela (1951), Shin Shinkai Bublaa Boo (1952), Anarkali (1953), Pehli Jhhalak (1954), Azad (1955), Asha (1957) and Amardeep (1958). For Madan Mohan, she performed for films like Baagi (1953), Railway Platform (1955), Pocketmar (1956), Mr. Lambu (1956), Dekh Kabira Roya (1957), Adalat (1958), Jailor (1958), Mohar (1959) and Chacha Zindabad (1959).

Choose how you want this story to end. (CNN) -- With her signature Friday on Senate Bill 1070, Gov. Jan Brewer launched Arizona into a maelstrom of national controversy, community conflict and extreme fiscal risk. In doing so, she failed a basic test of courageous leadership -- recognizing and acting responsibly when political symbolism and populist pandering crosses into dangerous policy. The governor should have known better, if only because recent history demonstrates the folly in enacting measures like Arizona's SB 1070. SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented. The neighboring state of California faced this circumstance 15 years ago when Gov. Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187, enacted by voters in November 1994. They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen OPTIONS: - Arizona. - CNN. - California. - Jan Brewer. - Pete Wilson. - Prop. - Proposition 187. - SB 1070. - Saenz. - Senate Bill 1070. - Thomas Saenz.","completion":"Arizona's SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen the state's efforts to maintain public safety and ensure the well-being of its residents. Although the bill has faced numerous challenges and sparked heated debate across the nation, the story can end with a positive outcome for Arizona through education, cooperation, and proper implementation of the law. The signing of SB 1070 by Gov. Jan Brewer marks a significant milestone in Arizona's history. The state has become an epicenter of immigration issues, and the enactment of this legislation has elicited strong emotions from both supporters and opponents. To ensure a successful implementation, it is crucial for the government and the community to foster a dialogue for understanding, compromise, and mutual respect. Understanding the reasons behind the law and the potential benefits it can provide will help mitigate the fear and apprehension felt by many. In order to proceed, it is essential for the state’s law-enforcement agencies to receive thorough training on the implementation of SB 1070. This comprehensive education will enable officers to carry out their duties responsibly and within the confines of the Constitution. Ensuring that racial profiling is not used unlawfully or unethically during the law enforcement process will be a critical factor in maintaining the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Moreover, continuous dialogue between the government, communities, and activists regarding the benefits and flaws of the law can help design better ways to collaborate. This constructive exchange of ideas can address the concerns of all parties involved, ultimately leading to a more efficient system for addressing immigration and public safety issues. Additionally, by working together with its neighboring states like California, who have previously dealt with controversial immigration legislatives such as Proposition 187, Arizona can learn from past successes and failures. This cooperative effort could result in a more effective implementation by using evidence-based best practices while reducing unnecessary expenditure in costly legal battles. In conclusion, the signing of SB 1070 by Gov. Jan Brewer marks the beginning of a new chapter in Arizona's history of dealing with immigration issues. By promoting understanding, cooperation, and proper implementation of the law, the state can work towards achieving its goals of maintaining public safety and addressing the concerns of all parties involved. This story can end on a positive note with Arizona leading the way in effective immigration policy for the United States, ultimately inspiring other states to follow suit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioural, and neural mechanisms. Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame.

Joanna la Beltraneja, born in 1462, the first and only daughter of King Henry IV of Castile, was of Asturias. A rumour spread that Princess Joanna was not actually the daughter of King Henry but rather of Beltrán de la Cueva, the alleged lover of Queen Joan of Portugal. Joanna was thus nicknamed \\"la Beltraneja\\", as a mocking reference to her assumed father. Pressure from members of the nobility forced the King to strip her of the title and name his half-brother Alfonso as heir, in 1464. In 1465, a group of nobility assembled in Ávila and overthrew King Henry, replacing him with Alfonso. That led to a war that ended in 1468 with the death of the 14-year-old Alfonso. Henry IV regained the throne, but the title of heir became disputed between Joanna, his daughter, and Isabella, his half-sister. That was resolved via the Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando, which gave Isabella succession rights but restricted her marriage options. Isabella secretly married Ferdinand in 1469 at the age of 17, ignoring Henry IV's wishes. Gradually, the couple gained a larger number of supporters and obtained a papal bull sanctioning their marriage from Pope Sixtus IV in 1472 and gained the support of the powerful Mendoza family in 1473. When Henry IV died in December 1474, both candidates for the throne were proclaimed Queen of Castile by their respective supporters. Aware of their position of weakness against Isabella's supporters, Joanna's supporters proposed for the 43-year-old King Afonso V of Portugal, a widower for some 20 years, to marry Joanna, his niece, and assume the throne of Castile with her.

Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe. - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands.

Southampton had three first-half penalty appeals — one of which was particularly convincing — but this was a gutsy, impressive win on a day that made it impossible to play the brand of football that is the trademark of manager Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool playmaker Phillipe Coutinho strikes from outside the area to put his side ahead in the third minute. Coutinho (centre) celebrates with his Liverpool team-mates after putting his side in front against Southampton. Here's how it happened - our graphic shows the speed and distance of Coutinho's superb early opener for the Reds at St Mary's. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling then made it 2-0 in the second half against Southampton at St Mary's.

Philippe Coutinho's superb opener for Liverpool. CLICK HERE for more from Sportsmail's excellent Match Zone. Liverpool had to tough it out instead, and did. In a spoiling swirl of wind and driving rain, not to mention strength-sapping bitter cold, they dug in against the formidable aerial power of Graziano Pelle, and the midfield worked hard. They have now kept five consecutive clean sheets away from home in the league — a record unmatched since 1985, the days of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson. No, it wasn’t the prettiest, but it was never going to be, and Philippe Coutinho’s first goal at least was a thing of beauty. It was fitting that it should take place in front of local hero Matt Le Tissier, too. It will not have greatly pleased him — he is too much of a Southampton loyalist for that — but he would surely have admired the artistry and the technique. Lazar Markovic slipped a simple pass inside to Coutinho and he turned it into something truly magnificent with a curling shot from 30 yards. Le Tissier scored a few like that and it may have jogged his memory as Coutinho’s effort bent perfectly beyond the reach of Fraser Forster, struck the underside of the bar and bounced down over the line, as if the ball itself knew a degree of aesthetic flamboyance was required for such a finish. That was after just three minutes, and 70 had passed by the time Liverpool struck their next shot on target, again with success. The fact that Southampton’s usually pin-sharp defence made not one, but two mistakes, on the way to goal illustrates the job that Liverpool had done by then. soaking up the pressure and leaving them exhausted. Coutinho struck a superb effort from 25 yards which left Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster helpless. Southampton goalkeeper Forster could do nothing as he was beaten by the Brazilian's excellent finish. Coutinho (right) celebrates with team-mates Lazar Markovic (left), Sterling (second left) and Joe Allen. Former Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana (left) is tackled by Steven Davis of Southampton at St Mary's. What did Graham Poll make of the declined penalty appeals? Find out here. One would never have guessed it was Liverpool that had played a European game as recently as Thursday. Southampton substitute Morgan Schneiderlin played a careless square ball directly to Alberto Moreno, whose forward run ended with a cross which should have been cleared by Matt Targett. Instead, off-balance, he tapped it helplessly to Raheem Sterling, who drove the ball through a crowd of players, goalkeeper Forster unsighted until it was too late. So nothing to celebrate yet, but suddenly Liverpool have options. When Rodgers left out Daniel Sturridge many felt it was a sign he was prioritising the Europa League as the best entry route to next season’s Champions League. Not after this. If it was even half in Rodgers’s mind that the small number of set-pieces required to secure cup qualification might prove less of an obstacle than an assault on a top four, he can now afford to play both ends. Manchester United must be worried. Squeezed by Arsenal and Southampton, and now Liverpool, the league is their only route back. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers directs his players in the rain on the touchline in front of Southampton boss Ronald Koeman (right) Liverpool's teenage winger Jordon Ibe attempts to take the ball past Southampton youngster Matt Targett. Filip Djuricic of Southampton is caught in a sandwich between Dejan Lovren (top) and Joe Allen. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet rushes out to the edge of his area to block a shot from Southampton's Eljero Elia. And what of Southampton, pace-setters, fairy-tale, the Champions League choice of all football romantics? It is going to be hard going from here. Southampton have won one game in the last five in all competitions and Sunday’s display fizzled out into a standard hard- luck story of penalty appeals denied. They didn’t play poorly, but they didn’t convince, either, and the feeling of injustice that permeated St Mary’s obscures a dip in form. Southampton look leggy and their threat reduced as the game wore on. The filthy weather that plagued the south coast made flowing football a forlorn hope, so no wonder much of Southampton’s threat came from balls in the air, won by Pelle, who was a handful without being a threat. Liverpool do not care for that option, as Rodgers made plain on the day he told Andy Carroll he had no future at the club. Even so, the real enemy, according to the locals, was not the rain or the wind but referee Kevin Friend, who rejected four penalty appeals. That the first came after just 25 seconds created a feeling of injustice to rival that felt by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Friend, who is having a weekend of it, was the fourth official at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, too. New signing Filip Djuricic, on his debut, was the first to fail to convince Friend, putting Emre Can under pressure from the opening attack of the game. Can certainly seemed to place a hand on his shoulder, and not in a fatherly way, but not with the force needed to make Djuricic collapse as he did. The ease with which he went down probably got Can off the hook. Maybe Djuricic, on loan from Benfica, would have swayed official judgment in Portugal’s league, but not here. The second was more convincing, Joe Allen bringing down Djuricic only to find Friend curiously unmoved. The ball ran free to Eljero Elia, who forced Simon Mignolet to make a fine save, overlooked in the furore. Liverpool forward Sterling is tackled by Southampton defender Jose Fonte at St Mary's while goalkeeper Forster watches on. Dejan Lovren (left) appears to handle the ball in an incident which saw Southampton unsuccessfully appeal for a penalty. Southampton forward Eljero Elia charges forward with the ball as he battles with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) Only Fraser Forster (12) and Ben Foster (West Brom, 10) have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Simon Mignolet (nine). A final penalty appeal was made against Can, for handball, just before half-time but there was a growing feeling of resignation about Southampton’s desperate pleas. Seconds earlier, they were making a strong case for a free-kick just outside the box. A long pass sent Elia through and Mignolet came charging from his line, intercepting with inches to spare on the edge of the area. It hit his body inside, but perhaps a hand outside, although it is hard to see how Friend could have made a handball call with any certainty. TV replays were not totally clear initially, suggesting his reluctance was justified. Even if video technology is allowed it is unlikely to clear up incidents such as this in the time allotted. Sterling had one rejected at the other end, too, but it appeared Jose Fonte got the ball. Even if he hadn’t, it is hard to imagine Friend pointing to the spot. Maybe he’s just the sceptical type.

Liverpool forward Sterling struck from inside the penalty area to make it 2-0 as Morgan Schneiderlin (left) tried to prevent him.

In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name.

Says parents who 'hide' their body tell daughters they should be 'ashamed' of their own.

It's a crucial period for both parents and their daughters as they navigate the complexities of growth and self-discovery. Dr. Helen Wright, an expert in child development and family dynamics, has recently published a guidebook aimed at helping parents better understand and support their teenage daughters. In this article, we will discuss the key takeaways from Dr. Wright's advice on fostering a healthy and supportive environment for teenage girls. 1. Be a Good Role Model for Your Daughter: One of the most important things a parent can do for their teenage daughter is to be a positive role model. This includes demonstrating healthy behaviors, such as respectful communication, emotional intelligence, and responsible decision-making. By embodying these qualities, parents encourage their daughters to also adopt these traits, which will benefit them throughout their lives. 2. Help Her Deal with Peer Pressure: Peer pressure is an inevitable part of adolescence, and it can be a significant challenge for teenage girls. Parents should be aware of the possible negative influences their daughters may face and actively support and guide them to make good decisions. Providing an open and non-judgmental environment for communication, asking about their friends and social activities, and actively listening to their concerns are all crucial steps in helping girls resist peer pressure. 3. Accept That Mood Swings are Normal: The teenage years are marked by hormonal changes and emotional turbulence. Dr. Wright emphasizes that parents should accept and be prepared for mood swings as a natural part of their daughter's development. Instead of dismissing them, offering support and empathy during challenging times will help strengthen the parent-daughter bond. 4. Avoid Fad Diets and Encourage a Healthy Relationship with Food: Many teenage girls may feel pressured to conform to societal ideals of beauty, which may lead to unhealthy eating habits and body image issues. Dr. Wright advises mothers to avoid fad diets and instead promote a healthy, balanced approach to food. By modeling positive eating habits and focusing on overall health rather than appearance, parents can help their daughters develop a healthy relationship with their bodies and food. 5. Don't \\"Hide\\" Your Body or Promote Body Shame: Lastly, Dr. Wright emphasizes the importance of transparency and openly embracing one's body, regardless of its shape and size. Parents who \\"hide\\" their bodies inadvertently send a message to their daughters that they should be ashamed of their own. By embracing and maintaining a positive body image, parents can encourage their daughters to also accept and love themselves just as they are. Conclusion: Navigating the teenage years with a daughter is a rewarding, yet challenging experience for both parties. Dr. Helen Wright's guidebook offers parents invaluable advice to help them better understand and support their growing girls. By implementing these strategies, parents can help create a supportive and nurturing environment that will empower their teenage daughters to develop into confident, self-assured young women."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

Doctors say obesity,also known as severe overweight,is a complex condition.A doctor may advise medical interventions in addition to changes in behavior.But experts say the more successful weightloss plans include a wellbalanced diet and exercise. People who want to avoid weight gain have to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they use.To lose weight,you can reduce the number of calories you take in,or increase the number you use,or both.Experts at the National Institutes of Health say to lose weight,a person should do some moderate or intensive physical exercise most days of the week.This could include fast walking,sports or strength training. A recent study looked at four of the most popular dieting plans in the United States.Researchers at Stanford University studied more than three hundred overweight women,mostly in their thirties or forties.Each woman went on one of the four plans:Atkins,The Zone,Ornish or LEARN.The women attended diet classes and received written information about the food plans.At the end of a year,the women on the Atkins diet had lost the most,more than four and a half kilograms on average. Christopher Gardner led the study,reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals.

They are illegal on earth, and if they make it to our planet they are hunted down and killed.Rick Deckard is a blade runner, a hunter of replicants. A group of replicants makes it to Los Angeles seeking a way to extend their life span. Replicants have a built-in 4 year life span, and this group is near the end.==========================================A crawl after the opening credits informs us that, in the near future, technology that has created synthetic humans has entered a new phase: replicants, sophisticated androids that are virtually identical to humans, are now equal in strength and emotion to their creators. Replicants are designed and built by the Tyrell Corporation, a giant multi-conglomerate headquartered in two pyramid-like towers. The latest version of replicant technology is the Nexus 6 model. Replicants are mostly used as manual laborers in the \\"off world\\" colonies out in space. Because of their advanced nature and tendency towards violence, replicants have been outlawed on Earth.

Please answer this question: Who played 'Gandhi' in the film of the same name?","completion":"The actor who portrayed 'Gandhi' in the film of the same name is Sir Ben Kingsley. Ben Kingsley, who was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji on December 31, 1943, in Snainton, England, played the lead role of Mahatma Gandhi in the critically acclaimed film. 'Gandhi' is a 1982 biographical historical drama film directed by Richard Attenborough, and it documents the life and times of the famed Indian independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi. Ben Kingsley's riveting performance in the film was lauded by critics and audiences alike. His portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi, from young adulthood to his final days in the epic struggle for Indian independence, is considered one of the finest performances in cinematic history. Kingsley meticulously prepared for the role by losing weight, adopting Indian lifestyle practices, and studying intensive research materials about Gandhi's personal life and political career. In fact, his portrayal of Gandhi is considered so accurate that many people who had personally met or interacted with Mahatma Gandhi praised Kingsley for his captivating and faithful representation. Kingsley's outstanding performance in 'Gandhi' earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1983, a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. The film itself went on to achieve great success – both critically and commercially – winning eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Attenborough. This film and Kingsley's portrayal of Gandhi solidified his status as one of the finest actors of his generation, leading to a long and illustrious career in film and television for the British actor. Some of his other notable roles include acclaimed performances in 'Schindler's List,' 'Sexy Beast,' 'House of Sand and Fog,' and 'Iron Man 3,' among many others. In 2002, Ben Kingsley was honored with a knighthood in recognition of his exceptional contributions to the arts and entertainment industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \\"secret messages to ourselves\\". Question: According to the passage, Elias Howe was _ . Options: A: much more hard-working than other inventors B: the first person who solved problems while sleeping C: the first person at the time who knew the value of dreams D: the first person to design a sewing machine that really worked The answer is:","completion":"D: the first person to design a sewing machine that really worked"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the album that was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels? Answer the above question based on the context below: Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single....

The organization is responsible for promoting and developing the sport globally, coordinating international events and competitions, and establishing standard rules and guidelines to ensure fair play. One of the most notable events associated with the World Croquet Federation is the MacRobertson Shield. The MacRobertson Shield is a prestigious international croquet competition that was first held in 1925. It is the oldest and most renowned tournament in the sport of croquet, featuring the best teams from around the world. Initially, the MacRobertson Shield was contested between Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. However, since 1993, the United States has also participated in the tournament. The MacRobertson Shield is played using the \\"Association Croquet\\" version of the game, which follows specific rules and tactics different from those of the more commonly known garden croquet. Association Croquet requires a higher degree of skill, strategy, and precision than its garden counterpart, making it more appealing for serious players and competitive tournaments like the MacRobertson Shield. Throughout the years, the World Croquet Federation has continued to evolve and expand, now encompassing over 30 member countries across various continents. These countries actively participate in managing the organization, hosting events, and promoting the sport within their territories. Apart from the MacRobertson Shield, the World Croquet Federation sanctions and organizes several other notable international events, such as the World Championship, the Women's World Championship, and various age group competitions.

She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm.

They challenged the legality of restraint methods used against them in April 2009 when they were contained by officers in Bishopsgate. But the Court of Appeal has now ruled against the High Court's decision. Mr Moos said it was \\"a shame\\" the appeal judges could not see that the police were \\"out of control\\". The High Court ruling, where officers were said to have used \\"unjustified force\\", led to a call from human rights lawyers for an \\"immediate change to police attitudes and tactics\\". Police used the kettling tactic - where demonstrators are corralled inside police cordons and prevented from leaving - against the protesters in Bishopsgate, even though they had been peaceful. The Met said the kettling was necessary to keep violent demonstrators at the Royal Exchange from \\"hijacking\\" the more peaceful climate camp, attended by up to 5,000 people. The High Court had ruled there had been no evidence of an imminent breach of the peace to justify the kettle, which was in place for more than four hours. Mr Moos, who was part of a peaceful protest camp, said he had become dehydrated after being refused permission to leave. When the police announced an appeal they made it clear the judgement did not outlaw kettling, and containment tactics would continue to be used \\"to prevent serious disorder and violence\\". The Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger, sitting in the Court of Appeal with Lord Justice Hughes and Lord Justice Sullivan, ruled against the High Court decision. In his ruling, Lord Neuberger said the Met's appeal was being allowed because the Divisional Court (High Court) had \\"applied the wrong test when assessing whether there was an imminent risk of breach of the peace\\". Rather than assessing the \\"reasonableness\\" of the view taken by the officer in charge on the day, the High Court judges had formed their own view, the Court of Appeal heard. \\"Even if they decided that (the officer's) view was unreasonable, there was no valid basis for reaching such a decision,\\" said Lord Neuberger. The decision to contain the crowd of protesters at the climate camp was justifiable because of fears of the serious risk of them being joined by \\"dispersing demonstrators from another substantial crowd\\" which had been seriously violent and disorderly, the court heard. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the verdict, saying: \\"As the August riots and student protests highlighted last year, in order to appropriately respond to a situation of disorder, police must have available to them a wide array of tactics.\\" He said clear parameters were needed so that in the future both protesters and police officers know when kettling methods would be used.

If there isn't any food other than candy, what type of store is he probably in? Choices: - department store - gas station - grocery store - drugstore - supermarket The rationale to choose \\"drugstore\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The aisle with over the counter medication is one of the strongest indicators that John might be in a drugstore. Additionally, the presence of assorted items, toys, and candy also suggests that the store offers goods beyond just medications and pharmaceutical products, which is typical for a drugstore. Drugstores often stock a variety of products, including non-prescription medicines, health and beauty items, small toys, greeting cards and, of course, candy. Now, let's examine the other choices to further establish why \\"drugstore\\" is the most appropriate answer: 1. Department Store: These stores typically sell a wide range of products, including clothing, electronics, and home goods. While they may carry some over the counter medications, this wouldn't be the primary focus of their inventory. Additionally, the fact that there doesn't appear to be food other than candy also makes it unlikely that John is in a department store, as these stores often have a food department or an area with pre-packaged snacks, unlike a drugstore. 2. Gas Station: While gas stations can sometimes carry a small selection of over the counter medications and assorted items, they generally wouldn't have an entire aisle dedicated to medication. Their primary purpose is to provide fuel and other car-related services, with convenience items available for purchase. The limited food options, specifically only candy, also doesn't rule out the gas station, but the emphasis on medications makes it less likely than a drugstore. 3. Grocery Store: A grocery store focuses primarily on selling food products, and while they do typically have an aisle for over the counter medications, their inventory concentrates on various food items. The fact that John doesn't see any food other than candy strongly suggests that he isn't in a grocery store. 4. Supermarket: Supermarkets are essentially larger versions of grocery stores, with an extensive range of food products and a broader selection of household items, including over the counter medications. However, just like with grocery stores, the absence of food other than candy indicates that John is not in a supermarket. Taking all of this into account, the answer \\"drugstore\\" makes the most sense. The presence of an aisle dedicated to over the counter medications, along with the fact that the store offers various non-food items, lends itself to the idea that John is in a drugstore. The absence of food products other than candy further supports this conclusion, given the typically limited food selection in drugstores. Thus, the rationale for choosing \\"drugstore\\" as the answer is based on the specific features of the store, such as the medication aisle and the variety of non-food items available, as well as the exclusion of other options based on their distinguishing characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: Nothing could more aptly epitomize the Mutiny's good and bad results, from an Indian point of view, than the name given to the legislation that was to the 1858 Act for Better Government of India. Here is a hypothesis: The Better Government did, ultimately, make India a better place to live. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis in relation to the premise, it is essential to critically discuss both concepts, as well as relevant context and evidence. Premise: The 1858 Act for the Better Government of India was enacted following the Mutiny - a turning point in the history of British rule in India. This event, also known as the First War of Indian Independence or the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a large-scale uprising against British rule in India. It is crucial to understand that this legislation was intended to address the dissatisfaction in Indian society at the time, which had arisen due to numerous factors, including political, social, economic, and religious grievances. Hypothesis: If the Better Government in India did indeed make the country a better place to live, it would be necessary to weigh this statement against several criteria, such as improvements in political, social, economic, and religious arenas. This evaluation could help determine the overall impact on the lives of people in India. To address the relationship between the premise and hypothesis to assess the validity of the hypothesis, it is useful to consider key changes implemented by the 1858 Act and their effects in the context of India during that time. 1. Political changes: The Act brought about several fundamental political changes, such as the end of the East India Company's rule and the beginning of direct British rule under the British Crown. As India officially became a colony of the British Empire, the Secretary of State for India was appointed to handle administrative affairs, with the Viceroy as the highest-ranking British official in India. This change symbolizes a more prominent and direct British involvement in the governance of India, which could have potentially improved the country's administration. 2. Social changes: The Act led to better interaction between the British and Indian society. A fundamental aspect of the Act was the 'Doctrine of Lapse' policy, which prohibited the adoption of an heir by an Indian ruler who dies without a natural heir. The purpose of this policy was to prevent Indian rulers from maintaining control over their territories, thus enabling the British to expand their empire. Despite this, the British became more cautious in their rule and sought to respect the socio-cultural customs of Indians. 3. Economic changes: Under the Act, India's economy became more integrated with Britain. The British developed India's infrastructure, including railways, telegraphs, and postal services. As a result, trade increased between Britain and India as well as greater communication and transportation facilitated by these advancements. However, the benefits of this economic development had varying impacts on the people in India, with some people in certain regions benefitting more than others. 4. Religious changes: One of the aftermaths of the mutiny was that the British recognized the importance of respecting religious sentiments of Indians. They became cautious in interfering with local religious practices and traditions. This led to efforts to ensure religious and cultural sensitivities were acknowledged, promoting a more inclusive administration. In conclusion, it is challenging to universally determine whether the hypothesis that the Better Government made India a better place to live holds true. The premise highlights the changes brought about by the 1858 Act for the Better Government of India, while the hypothesis assumes a positive overall impact. Although the Act led to substantial political, social, economic, and religious changes and addressed some shortcomings exposed in the aftermath of the Mutiny, whether these changes were ultimately beneficial depends on the perspectives and experiences of different sections of the Indian population. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not absolute; the hypothesis may be true for some, and not for others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved?

Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease. Which town is experiencing more groundwater contamination? Hint: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] A:","completion":"Town A is likely experiencing more groundwater contamination due to their conventional disposal of biomedical waste in a regular dump site for 10 years, as opposed to Town B's eco-friendly waste management practices. Biomedical waste poses significant dangers to the environment, public health, and the community. It consists of infectious materials, sharps, toxic chemicals, and radioactive elements. When this hazardous waste is mixed with municipal waste or disposed of improperly into regular dump sites, the risks of groundwater contamination and the spread of diseases increase. In Town A, the disposal of biomedical waste in regular dump sites allows the waste to leach into the soil and, eventually, the groundwater. Groundwater, an essential source of drinking water and irrigation, becomes contaminated with harmful chemicals, toxins, and infectious agents that result from the decomposition of this waste. Contaminated groundwater can lead to waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. Moreover, residents in the area may experience higher rates of respiratory problems, skin infections, and other illnesses associated with exposure to harmful substances and pathogens present in the biomedical waste. On the other hand, Town B's approach to waste management represents a more responsible and safer alternative. By taking their biomedical waste to an ecological site specifically designed for the disposal and treatment of hazardous waste, Town B minimizes the risk of groundwater contamination and the spread of disease. Ecological waste management sites follow strict regulations and use proper treatment methods, such as incineration, autoclaving, or chemical disinfection, to ensure that waste is effectively neutralized before disposal. This not only reduces the risk of groundwater contamination but also lessens the likelihood of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, that can result from improper waste management practices. In conclusion, by disposing of their biomedical waste in regular dump sites for 10 years, Town A has increased the likelihood of groundwater contamination and disease spread in their community. On the other hand, Town B's responsible ecological waste management practices have significantly reduced these risks, leading to better public health and a safer environment."},{"prompt":"Question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Best Subsonic client still!

Article: Scholars now believe that the Arian Party was not monolithic, but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum. They supported the tenets of Origenist thought and theology, but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled \\"Arian\\" did not consider themselves followers of Arius. In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.[citation needed] Question: Did all Arians believe the same things?","completion":"No, not all Arians believed in the same things. Although it is common to view the Arian Party as a monolithic entity espousing a singular set of beliefs, recent scholarship has come to challenge this perception. Instead, it is now believed that the Arian Party was a more diverse group of individuals and their theological views varied across the spectrum of early Christian thought. One common thread shared by the Arians was their support for Origenist thought and theology, which was derived from the teachings of the early Christian theologian Origen. Origenism emphasized the pre-existence of souls, the allegorical interpretation of scriptures, and a belief in the final restoration of all souls to God (apokatastasis). However, beyond these shared tenets, individual Arian beliefs diverged significantly. It is important to note that many individuals labeled as \\"Arian\\" did not explicitly identify as followers of Arius, the presbyter and theologian from Alexandria who lent his name to the movement. In fact, some non-Homoousian bishops – who rejected the concept of the Son being of the same substance as the Father – took issue with being labeled as followers of Arius. These bishops, being fully ordained, did not appreciate being compared to a mere presbyter. The Council of Nicaea, convened in 325 CE, also played a role in contributing to the misconception of Arianism as a homogenous theological ideology. Although the council aimed to resolve the controversy surrounding the nature of the relationship between the Father and the Son, it led to the development of the Nicene Creed, which reinforced the view of Arianism as a cohesive theological perspective. The resulting debate surrounding Arianism and its rejection at the Council of Nicaea may have unintentionally contributed to the simplification of the movement's beliefs. In summary, it is incorrect to assume that all Arians believed in the same things. The Arian Party was, in fact, a more diverse group with theological views that spanned a wide range of early Christian beliefs. It is essential to recognize this complexity to better understand the nuances of the theological debates and controversies that shaped the early Christian Church."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use. However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month. The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean. ” Anyone who uses cocaine will likely have a comedown or “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off. This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days. The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms. If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following: Severe cravings Nausea and vomiting Paranoia, depression, or anxiety Mood swings or irritability Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams Fatigue and exhaustion If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you. Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between 1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to 20,000. There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors: How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals. Summary:","completion":"Cocaine is a drug that makes people feel super happy and active for a while, but after that, they feel really, really tired and sad. If someone uses cocaine just one time, it can be found in their pee for 4 days. But if someone uses it a lot, it can be found in their body even after a month. When people stop using cocaine, they can feel sick, scared, itchy, and have trouble sleeping. They might also feel like something creepy is crawling on their skin. It's because their body is trying to get used to not having any more cocaine. If people have been using cocaine a lot and for a long time, they might need to go to a special doctor who will help them feel better while their body is cleaning out the cocaine. This can take a while, from 3 days to even more than a week. Depending on how much help they need, it may cost a lot of money. There is not a quick way to clean out cocaine from someone's body. So, how long it takes for the cocaine to leave depends on how much someone used it, how often they were using it, how strong it was, if they were using it with alcohol, how well their liver and kidneys are working, and how much they weigh."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Bad, Bad, BAD Review: This game is really bad.. the graphics are just terrible. The gameplay is slow, and very very VERY choppy. I messed around with everything the best i could.. cleared my desktop.. yada yada yada and nothing helped. I'm sure it is a great game if it worked on your computer, but it probably takes up so much darn space and everything else that it is just too much for your computer and graphic/sound cards.. oh yeah my sound disappears as well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, buy the first two.. they were GREAT! Also, I wouldnt buy any future hard truck/18 wheels of steel games.. they are just going to take more space. I'm actually quitting buying ALL computer games, cuz games now take up too much. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. Several factors contribute to the overall negative tone. The title, \\"Bad, Bad, BAD,\\" immediately sets the tone for the rest of the review, as it emphasizes the author's dissatisfaction with the product. Furthermore, the reviewer uses strong negative words and phrases throughout the review like \\"terrible,\\" \\"slow,\\" \\"choppy\\" and \\"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\\" Apart from criticizing the graphics and gameplay, the reviewer also expresses frustration with the technical issues they experienced while trying to play the game, such as the disappearing sound and the game taking up a lot of space on their computer. This further adds to the negative tone of the review, indicating that the game is not only poorly designed, but also technically flawed. However, there is a brief positive mention in the review when the author recommends buying the first two games in the series, stating that they were \\"GREAT!\\" Nevertheless, this moment of positivity is overshadowed by the overall negative sentiment expressed in the rest of the review. Additionally, the reviewer extends their dissatisfaction to future games in the series and the entire genre of computer games, claiming that they will quit buying all computer games due to the increasing space requirements. In summary, the product review carries a strongly negative tone, as it criticizes multiple aspects of the game, highlights technical issues, expresses doubts about future products in the series, and suggests an overarching frustration with computer games in general. The positive mention of the previous games in the series does little to balance out the overwhelmingly negative tone of the review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate \\"I want to see them right away.\\" to Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the sentence \\"I want to see them right away.\\" can be translated as: \\"Chci je vidět hned.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Chci\\" (I want) comes from the verb \\"chtít\\" (to want) and is conjugated in the first person singular, to express the speaker's desire. - \\"je\\" (them) is the personal pronoun in the accusative case, referring to the object or people the speaker wants to see. - \\"vidět\\" (to see) is an infinitive verb in Czech and is used after \\"chci\\" (I want) to express the specific action the speaker wants to perform - in this case, seeing someone or something. - \\"hned\\" (right away) is an adverb that indicates immediacy, reinforcing the speaker's urgency to see them as soon as possible. So, putting all these together, \\"Chci je vidět hned\\" captures the intended meaning of the original English sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does Leo assault?, using the article: A childhood accident leaves Leo mute and his devout Amish mother refuses surgery. As an adult in 2035, he works as a bartender at a Berlin strip club owned by Maksim and dates cocktail waitress Naadirah. She confides in her friend Luba that she has not told Leo about her past or her desperate need for money. After Stuart, a rowdy customer, sexually harasses Naadirah, Leo assaults him. Naadirah talks Leo down by telling him that she needs to keep her job. Naadirah shows up at Leo's apartment and attempts to tell him about something important. Leo shows her an elaborate bed he has been carving as a present for her. Naadirah is overcome with emotion and they have sex. Elsewhere, Maksim's mobsters meet two American surgeons, Cactus Bill and Duck, who run a black-market clinic. Bill desperately wants to leave Berlin and has pressed Maksim to provide forged documents for him and his young daughter, Josie. Duck, however, enjoys living in Berlin and runs a side business where he installs implants and performs cybernetic surgery. Stuart returns to the strip club and taunts Leo, leading to a fight and Maksim firing Leo. When he's unable to contact Naadirah, Leo asks Luba for help, but Luba refuses. An anonymous text message leads Leo to a black-market bazaar run by Stuart. Bill and Josie are there, and Bill takes Josie away as Stuart confronts Leo. Suddenly remembering that Naadirah wrote an address on his notepad a while back, Leo leaves the bazaar after using charcoal to read the imprint. Naadirah's address leads Leo to Oswald. When Leo expresses interest in a picture of Naadirah, Oswald assumes Leo works for Maksim's underling Nicky Simsek, who is skimming money from Maksim's prostitutes.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Movie title: Alphaville Context: Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from \\"the Outlands\\". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Mustang,[3] called a Ford Galaxie,[4] he poses as a journalist named Ivan Johnson, and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda. He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville is an inhuman, alienated society. Caution is told that men are killed at a ratio of fifty to every one woman executed. He also learns that Swedes, Germans and Americans assimilate well with Alphaville. Images of the EÂ =Â mcÂ² and E = hf equations are displayed several times throughout the film as symbols of the regime of logical science that rules Alphaville.

Write an article with the title: \\"Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve\\"","completion":"Title: Memorial Day ceremonies honor those who serve Introduction: Every year on the last Monday in May, the United States commemorates those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. Memorial Day ceremonies across the nation honor these fallen heroes by providing an opportunity for reflection, remembrance, and expression of gratitude. These events serve as a crucial reminder that the freedom and security we enjoy today have been paid for with the lives of those who have fought valiantly to protect it. (In this introduction, I establish the context of Memorial Day and its significance to American society, as well as the role these ceremonies play in honoring the sacrifice of servicemembers.) 1. The history of Memorial Day Memorial Day originated as \\"Decoration Day\\" in the years following the Civil War, when individuals would visit cemeteries to decorate the graves of fallen soldiers. The first large-scale commemoration occurred in 1868, and it eventually evolved into a national observance under the name Memorial Day. In 1971, it was established as an official federal holiday to be celebrated on the last Monday of May each year. By discussing the history of Memorial Day I provide a background of the holiday and how it started. 2. Honoring the fallen with ceremonies and traditions Across the United States, communities honor the fallen through various ceremonies and traditions. These may include: - The National Moment of Remembrance: A national act of unity observed at 3 p.m. local time, during which all Americans are encouraged to pause for a minute of silence to remember the fallen and their sacrifices. This illustrates a shared tradition and moment of respect for those who have served. - Parades: Many towns and cities host parades featuring veterans, military personnel, and local organizations. Parades allow communities to come together and publicly express their gratitude for the service and sacrifices of the fallen. - Flag Etiquette: On Memorial Day, flags are raised to full-staff in the morning and then lowered to half-staff until noon to honor the fallen. In the afternoon, they are raised once more to represent the resilience of the nation and the sacrifices made to preserve freedom. Describing these actions helps the reader to understand national rituals and customs tied to the holiday. 3. Community involvement: Volunteering and educating future generations By taking part in Memorial Day ceremonies and commemorations, communities can instill the importance of service and sacrifice in future generations. Volunteer opportunities, such as cemetery cleanups or placing flags on the graves of fallen service members, foster a sense of civic responsibility and teach valuable lessons about the cost of freedom. Additionally, engaging children in these activities ensures that the memories of those who have given their lives for their country will not be forgotten. This section highlights the role of communities in perpetuating the memory and message of Memorial Day. Conclusion: Memorial Day ceremonies hold a significant place in American society as a tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom and security. Through nationwide observances, individual acts of remembrance, and community participation, these ceremonies ensure that the brave men and women who have fought for our country are honored and remembered for generations to come. By concluding the article, I reiterate the importance of Memorial Day ceremonies and their role in honoring the fallen servicemembers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: A subclass needs to make money to cover its costs. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The statement \\"a subclass has to generate revenue to cover its costs\\" explicitly lays out the requirement that a subclass must be financially self-sufficient. In order to achieve this, the subclass must indeed generate revenue, which can be interpreted as making money. Since the premise states that this revenue generation is intended to cover the associated costs, the hypothesis, \\"a subclass needs to make money to cover its costs,\\" aligns directly with the premise. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be better understood if we break it down into more detail. The premise establishes the following conditions: 1. There is a subclass. 2. The subclass has costs associated with its operation or existence. 3. The subclass is required to generate revenue. 4. The purpose of this revenue generation is to cover these aforementioned costs. Given these conditions provided by the premise, the hypothesis logically follows. If a subclass is required to generate revenue in order to cover its costs, then it naturally needs to make money for that same purpose. Therefore, we can conclude that the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis. It is important to note that this entailment is based on a specific context in which the subclass must be financially self-sufficient and generate revenue to cover its costs. If the context or criteria change, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis may no longer hold true.

Information: - The judiciary (also known as the judicial system or court system) is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary also provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes. In some nations, under doctrines of separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets law and applies it to the facts of each case. In other nations, the judiciary can make law, known as Common Law, by setting precedent for other judges to follow, as opposed to Statutory Law made by the legislature. The Judiciary is often tasked with ensuring equal justice under law. - The Governor of California is the chief executive of the California state government, commander-in-chief of the California National Guard and the California State Military Reserve, whose responsibilities also include making annual State of the State addresses to the California State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. The position was created in 1849, the year before California became a state. The current governor is Jerry Brown, a Democrat who was inaugurated January 3, 2011, and who had previously served as governor from 1975 to 1983. In October 2013, Jerry Brown surpassed Earl Warren for the longest cumulative period of time served as governor. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a crowned republic, Ireland is a parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic. - Baja California, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Baja California, is a state in Mexico.

Question: Information: - The Kent Music Report was a weekly record chart of Australian music singles and albums which was compiled by music enthusiast David Kent from May 1974 through to 1988. After 1988, the Australian Recording Industry Association, who had been using the report under licence for a number of years, chose to produce their own charts as the 'ARIA Charts'. - The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) is a trade group representing the Australian recording industry which was established in 1983 by six major record companies, EMI, Festival, CBS, RCA, WEA and Universal replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956. It oversees the collection, administration and distribution of music licenses and royalties. - The ARIA Charts are the main Australian music sales charts, issued weekly by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The charts are a record of the highest selling singles and albums in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the Kent Music Report which had been Australia's national charts since 1974. - \`\` Do for You '' / \`\` I Want It '' is a 1992 song recorded by the Australian act Euphoria . The track reached number seven on the ARIA Charts in 1992 and is the act 's third single after \`\` One In A Million . '' \`\` Do For You '' had a more mid-tempo dance feel , while \`\` I Want It '' had a techno / house beat , which featured rapper Young MC , who got credits on the latter .

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Now, researchers report that short people--at least in the past--were also more likely to die at a younger age than their taller peers. Their study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health , found that short bones have something to do with short life for more than 1,000 years. The conclusion was based on 490 sets of adult skeletal remains from an archaeological site in northeastern England , YC dating from the 9th century to about 1850 . About 55% of men and 73% of women died before the age of 45, and 39% of men and 56% of women died before age 30. The risk of death before age 30 declined as bone length increased. \\"This study provides evidence from an archaeological sample that long bone length is connected with age at death--those with smaller bones tend to die younger,\\" according to Dr. D.J.

Related Coverage Police: Both escaped inmates now back in custody ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) – The second escaped prison inmate has been captured in Albuquerque. Back in cuffs and on his way to a cell Saturday, Lionel Clah seemed to have few regrets about his run for freedom. “It’s been ten years in prison, I wanted to get out,” Clah told reporters. Clah later said he had fun while he was on the run and that it was all worth it. He and Joseph Cruz escaped from a prisoner transport van headed to Las Cruces Wednesday. Officials think the men got away in the Artesia area when the van stopped for gas. Just hours later they were caught on camera at an Albuquerque hotel. That sparked a manhunt that shut down parts of the city in recent days. Many residents say they lost sleep over it. “It’s just a little scary to know that somebody who was wanted, on the loose and stuff like that was so close. I mean, the past couple of days I’ve been kinda on edge, you know,” said Northeast Heights Resident Stacey Garcia. Joseph Cruz had been serving a life sentence for murder. Clah got a 30 year sentence for armed robbery, and a shooting, that injured a deputy. Cruz was caught Friday in the UNM area. Clah was still on the run until Saturday morning, when a woman living near Morris and Montgomery called police. “She returned home after a couple nights of being away and she believed someone was inside of her apartment,�? said Albuquerque Police Department Spokesperson Officer Simon Drobik. It was Clah. Drobik said, “Mr. Clah literally stepped out the front door and came out and surrendered. He did state to us he didn’t want anybody else to get hurt.” Residents say it’s a relief to hear they’re both back behind bars. Now they want answers as to how this happened in the first place. “You kinda wonder, but who knows the circumstances, but yeah, you really wonder how that could possibly happen,�? said a Northeast Heights resident, Bud Tuttle. “It would be good to say that yes, we’ve made changes to policies or we’re increasing our procedures or something, to help that this would not happen again,” said another nearby resident, Sarah Erb. Investigators are still trying to figure out if anyone helped these men during their escape. They’re interviewing their family, friends and even Corrections Department employees. Officials say the woman who lives in the apartment Clah was found at does know him but won’t say how. But they say if she willingly helped him, she will be arrested.

The U.S. Marshals said the search had grown to Texas and California, and were offering a 10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of either man. Cruz was sentenced in 2006 for murder in the first degree, attempted murder and child abuse.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished.

This simple, one ingredient treatment will add moisture to hair and make it easier to straighten. You'll need whole milk, a spray bottle, and a way to heat the milk. You start by boiling milk to release preservatives. Then, you'll cool the milk before applying to hair. By leaving this treatment on for thirty minutes once a week, you'll see significant improvement in the overall condition and manageability of your hair. If you have wavy hair, using a milk treatment may completely straighten it. For tighter curls, the milk provides a more relaxed wave, and improves the effect of other straightening methods. Boil milk and pour into a spray bottle. Then, place the spray bottle in the refrigerator to cool. Section damp hair and spray milk evenly covering every strand, and comb through hair. Let the milk sit on hair for half an hour to 45 minutes. Then, wash and condition hair. These two ingredients are added to numerous products to improve shine, clean oil and buildup from the scalp naturally, and help hair retain moisture. A simple at-home treatment that combines the two will turn kinky, frizzy curls into sleek, manageable tresses. Start with enough coconut milk to completely coat your hair. Overestimate to make sure you have enough. Mix the fruit of one lemon into the coconut milk. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Starting with damp or dry hair, coat thoroughly and leave in for about an hour. Then, wash and condition as usual. Lemon juice can also lighten your hair, so this may not be an ideal treatment, if you are trying to maintain your dye color. Castor oil is a great natural treatment for a number of health and beauty concerns. From dry skin to upset stomach, castor oil does it all. It's also a simple way to relax curls. Castor oil seeps into hair follicles and naturally reduces kinks and curls, leaving hair sleeker and straighter. Apply castor oil to damp or dry hair, and wrap hair in a towel. Use pins or clips to hold the towel in place. Leave on at least an hour, but let the product sit over night for best results. Wash and condition as usual.

Answer the following question: Information: - Krum was the Khan of Bulgaria from sometime after 796 but before 803 until his death in 814. During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation. - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek : , Nikphoros I , \`\` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the \`\` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,... - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup. - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \\"Old Mountain\\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560 km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula. - Pliska (, romanized: \\"Plskov\\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20 km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea. What is the relationship between 'nikephoros i' and '26 july 811'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between Nikephoros I and 26 July 811 is that on this date, Nikephoros I, the Byzantine Emperor, was killed in the Battle of Pliska.

After much research and deliberation, Mike had narrowed down his choices to either a reliable pickup truck that would allow him to haul heavy loads and go off-roading, or a stylish convertible that would let him bask in the sun and feel the wind in his hair as he cruised the open road. The dilemma now was to find a dealership that carried both vehicles so he could see which one felt right. One morning, as Mike sipped his coffee and scrolled through his phone, he came across an ad for a dealership an hour away in a neighboring town. The ad showcased the exact truck and convertible models he had been looking for. Excited, Mike decided to make a trip to the dealership that weekend to see these vehicles in person. Mike arrived at the dealership bright and early on Saturday. The sun was shining and there was a slight crispness in the air, almost as if it was encouraging him to choose the convertible. Eager to get started, Mike looked around for a salesman who could assist him. A friendly face approached him – it was Dan, a veteran car salesman who had been working in the industry for over two decades. Dan shook Mike's hand firmly and listened intently as Mike described his dilemma between the truck and the convertible. Dan, with his years of experience, knew what Mike was going through. The decision between two completely different vehicles could be tough, especially when both could bring joy and utility in their own way. Dan decided that it would be best if he let Mike experience both vehicles firsthand. First, they took the truck for a spin. Mike loved the commanding view of the road and the power of the engine as they accelerated. The truck's suspension made bumpy roads feel smooth, and Mike could already envision himself driving this truck on remote trails and hauling materials for his weekend home improvement projects. Next, they switched to the convertible. Upon getting in the driver's seat, Mike's face lit up as the roof disappeared into the trunk of the car with the push of a button. The driving experience with this car was completely different. He reveled in the sun kissing his face and the wind rushing through his hair as they cruised down winding roads, feeling free and alive. The world felt like his to explore, and he couldn't help but smile with every turn and acceleration. After their test drives, Mike and Dan sat down, and Mike shared his thoughts. Just as he was beginning to lean towards one vehicle, memories of the other would come flooding back and create confusion. Dan decided to share a bit of advice to help Mike make a decision. \\"Mike,\\" he began, \\"It's clear that you're torn between these two options. What's important to remember is that you need to prioritize your needs and desires. Think of your daily lifestyle and what would benefit you most. Consider not only the fun factor of each vehicle but also the practicality. And remember, life is too short to make decisions that don't bring you happiness.\\" As Mike took the evening to ponder his decision, he reflected on not only his current lifestyle but also what future endeavors he wished to pursue. He thought about the roads he had yet to explore and the possibilities that laid before him. Finally, Mike made up his mind. He was going to choose the convertible because he loved the feeling of freedom it provided and felt it fit better with his free-spirited nature. Although the truck may have been helpful for some aspects in his life, he believed prioritizing happiness was essential. He took Dan's advice to heart, and the following day, he returned to the dealership to begin the purchasing process. Looking back, Mike never regretted his choice. The convertible became synonymous with endless adventures, enjoyable road trips with family and friends, and a newfound happiness that emerged every time he went for a drive. While there were moments when a truck would have been useful, Mike always found alternatives, proving that he had ultimately made the choice that was right for him. The decision may have been challenging, but taking the time to consider his needs and desires ultimately led him to the vehicle that brought the most joy and fulfillment to his life for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals to make it a 3-3 tie at halftime. The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass. The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge. The Cowboys struck again before the end of the third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber. Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback Rex Grossman threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran it back for the score. With the lead in hand, the Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, which they did effectively with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run. Barber ended the night with over 100 yards rushing, and Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens caught eight passes for 145 yards. The Cowboys improved to 3-0, while the Bears dropped to 1-2.

News article: Nicaragua warns Costa Rica it may try to 'reclaim' province in court (AFP) – Sep 2, 2013 MANAGUA — President Daniel Ortega warned Costa Rica that Nicaragua may ask the International Court of Justice to restore to Managua a province he said it lost to \\"occupation\\" in 1824. Ortega was referring to Guanacaste province, which is about 20 percent of neighboring Costa Rica's territory and a popular tourism hub. \\"Costa Rica did not win that territory in an international court, but rather by force, with arms,\\" Ortega said at a military ceremony on Monday. He said he would like to negotiate with San Jose over the issue, an idea that has been rejected by Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla. Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More » ||||| Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla led a march protesting Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s bid to claim a tourist-rich province belonging to its southern neighbor. Chinchilla was joined by legislators, Cabinet members and protesters today in a “march for the homeland” that began in the town of Nicoya in the northwest province of Guanacaste. The province, home to some of Costa Rica’s most-visited beaches and hotels owned by Four Seasons Holdings Inc. and Hilton Worldwide Inc., is the country’s least populated and second-largest region, about the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. Tensions between the Central American neighbors were heightened last week when Ortega said he may file a case with the International Court of Justice to “recover” Guanacaste, which he claimed was Nicaraguan territory. Guanacaste was annexed to form part of Costa Rica in 1824, about three years after Central America’s independence from Spain. The anniversary of the annexation is a Costa Rican holiday celebrated on July 25. “We aren’t talking about a a tiny territory, we are talking about hundreds of kilometers,” Ortega said in an Aug. 13 speech. “This is something yet to be debated, and we should consider bringing a case to the International Court of Justice.” ‘Provocations’ Chinchilla, who is in the final year of her presidency, said Ortega’s threat ignored history and disrupted the “beautiful friendship” between Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans. Newspaper La Nacion said “hundreds” of people took part in the march. “President Ortega, we will not let your irresponsibility separate our countries,” Chinchilla, 54, said in a speech after the march. “We will not fall for your provocations, but we will also not be passive toward them.” Costa Rica and Nicaragua have a history of border and territorial disputes. The ICJ ruled in 2011 that Nicaraguan soldiers had to evacuate a swath of land south of the San Juan River, which serves as the countries’ international border. Nicaragua signed a treaty ceding Guanacaste to Costa Rica in 1858 shortly after the country had been under the temporary military rule of U.S. adventurer William Walker. “It wasn’t a treaty signed voluntarily and Costa Rica knows that,” said Carlos Arguello, Nicaragua’s representative to the ICJ, in a statement on the presidential website. “What is going to be done or can be done about it is up to the president.” 40 Billion Canal Ortega’s latest comments are meant to divert attention from Nicaragua’s 40 billion plan to build an inter-oceanic canal, according to Constantino Urcuyo, a political analyst at Ciapa, a policy research institute in San Jose, Costa Rica. Legislation granting a concession to build the canal was passed earlier this year by the Nicaraguan Congress, generating protests from opposition and environmental groups. “Ortega has had a lot of opposition to the canal project and to calm it he looked for an easy target,” Urcuyo said in a phone interview from San Jose. “Every time Ortega needs to earn national support, he resorts to his traditional enemy.” Costa Rica’s consulate in Managua, Nicaragua’s capital, has been closed since Aug. 18, when protesters blocked its entrance, Ambassador Javier Sancho said in a phone interview. “Some anti-Costa Rican sentiment has increased in recent days,” Sancho said. “Hopefully things will get back to normal shortly to the benefit of both the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan people.” To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Williams in San Jose, Costa Rica at awilliams111@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net; Andre Soliani at asoliani@bloomberg.net ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In September 2013, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega warned Costa Rica that Nicaragua may ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to restore Guanacaste province to Managua, which it claimed was lost due to \\"occupation\\" in 1824.

Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla rejected the idea of negotiating over the issue and led a march protesting Nicaragua's bid to claim the province. There has been a history of border and territorial disputes between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, with the ICJ making a ruling in 2011 on Nicaragua evacuating a piece of land that serves as the countries' international border. Nicaraguan President's claims over Guanacaste province were seen by some as a way to divert attention from Nicaragua’s 40 billion plan to build an inter-oceanic canal, which faced opposition from various groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After joining the university in 1981, he played under the guidance of Coach Dean Smith for three seasons until 1984. During his tenure with the UNC Tar Heels, Jordan went on to achieve phenomenal success and make a significant impact on the college basketball scene. Some of his most notable achievements during his college career include: 1. NCAA Championship (1982): As a freshman, Jordan played a crucial role in bringing the Tar Heels their second NCAA Championship. In the finals against Georgetown University, he scored the game-winning basket with a 16-foot jump shot with just 15 seconds left in the contest. This iconic moment etched his name in college basketball history. 2. Consensus First-Team All-American (1983 and 1984): At the end of his sophomore and junior seasons, Jordan was named to the Consensus First-Team All-American list, which recognizes outstanding college basketball players. This accolade was a testament to his talent and contribution to the Tar Heels' success during this period. 3.

Title: I've carried this pen for 12 years Review: I bought one of these for myself when i started college, wanting to have a nice pen i wouldn't loose, for note taking. 12 years later, i still have it and use it all the time. Years of being kept in my purse means it's outside has worn down quite a bit - the paint is rubbing off - but i think it's a badge of honor for a pen. Refills are easy to get. You can find them in any office supply store. It's one of those pens that demands better handwriting. People are more hesitant to steal it since it's a lot larger than most pens. That's probably why i've managed to keep it for so long.Just treated myself to a second one to keep at my desk and the mechanical pencil version for my sketchbook.Happy writing!

The reviewer states they have used the pen for 12 years, showing long-lasting satisfaction. 2. They mention the pen's worn-out appearance as a \\"badge of honor,\\" implying positive sentiment. 3. The reviewer mentions the ease of getting refills, indicating a good experience in continuing to use the product. 4. They say the pen \\"demands better handwriting,\\" which is considered an advantage and contributes to the positive tone of the review. 5.

Determine the sentiment: The proverb \\"Never judge a book by it's cover\\", was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface. As I viewed the artwork to,\\"King of the Ants\\" I instantly thought HORROR! The arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. Instead what I discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. \\"King of the Ants\\" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did I feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Cheers but MEAN! Now there are a couple of interesting \\"hallucination\\" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world. It prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue, and unlikely event after unlikely event. Oh the Horror!","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this review is predominantly negative. The author begins by expressing disappointment in the difference between their expectations based on the book's cover and the actual content, describing it as \\"less interesting than what you can find under your average rock.\\" Throughout the review, there is a continued focus on the flaws of the story and its characters. The author criticizes the protagonist, Sean Crawley, as unlikable, and the reader is told that they never felt any compassion or sympathy for him. Additionally, there are negative remarks about other characters like Daniel Baldwin's Ray Mathews, whom the author deems uninspired, and Kari Wuhrer's character, who is criticized for her lack of common sense. Furthermore, the author criticizes the dialogue in the story, calling it \\"laughable.\\" Although they acknowledge some positive aspects of the book such as the \\"interesting hallucination sequences,\\" the review highlights that these aspects are overshadowed by the numerous issues with character motivations, dialogue, and plot events. Overall, the sentiment of this review is quite negative as the author expresses dissatisfaction with the book's contents, characters, and dialogue and is disappointed by their experience as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: about the different areas of of the kind of the state by reading it Here is a hypothesis: Only by reading can one learn about the different areas of the kind of state it is. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To address this task, I will need to break down the premise and the hypothesis, compare them, and draw a conclusion based on the logical implications. Step 1: Understand the premise The premise seems to refer to the process of learning about the unique attributes of various regions within a specific state by reading about it. It suggests that reading is a valid method to get information about these areas. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the only way to learn about the unique attributes of a state is by reading. This suggests that reading is the solitary means of acquiring this information. Step 3: Compare premise and hypothesis The premise and the hypothesis both mention reading as a method of learning about the state's different areas. However, they diverge in a significant way. The premise suggests reading as a method, but it does not state that it's the exclusive way to learn. Conversely, the hypothesis claims that reading is the only way to gather information about the state’s regions. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Given the differences identified, it's impossible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise doesn't limit the methods of learning strictly to reading, while the hypothesis does. Therefore, even if the premise is true, and reading can indeed provide information about different regions within a state, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is also true, as there might be other ways to learn about such information not mentioned in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: \\"At what age should a man be concerned about being a 'creepy old man', rather than just a guy who’s dating?\\" Second question: What do you talk to women about in bars? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing, but they are related as they both pertain to interacting with or dating other individuals. I will address each question in detail below. First question: \\"At what age should a man be concerned about being a 'creepy old man', rather than just a guy who’s dating?\\" There isn't a specific age at which a man should be concerned about being perceived as a \\"creepy old man.\\" Age is just a number, and it is the way people behave and treat others that determines how they are perceived by others. In general, \\"creepy\\" behavior is characterized by being overly intrusive, making others feel uncomfortable, or pursuing individuals in an inappropriate manner. To avoid being perceived as a \\"creepy old man\\" regardless of age, it is important to follow some general guidelines: 1. Be respectful of boundaries: This includes understanding and respecting both physical and emotional boundaries of the person you are trying to establish a relationship with. 2. Act your age: It is essential to embrace life experiences and maturity while interacting with people. Trying to act much younger than your actual age can come across as disingenuous and may make others feel uncomfortable. 3. Be genuine: Do not use manipulative tactics or play games while trying to establish a connection with someone. People appreciate authenticity and honesty. 4. Be aware of the age difference: When dating someone considerably younger, take into consideration the potential difference in life stages and what that might mean for the relationship to be mutually beneficial and respectful. Second question: \\"What do you talk to women about in bars?\\" When it comes to talking to women in bars, the most effective approach is to initiate a conversation that feels natural and relaxed. Here are some suggestions for topics to engage in: 1. Small talk: Start with small talk, such as discussing the location, music, or drinks. This helps break the ice and sets a friendly tone for the conversation. 2. Hobbies and interests: Ask about her interests and hobbies, and share some of yours. This helps to assess common grounds and could potentially serve as a foundation to connect on a deeper level. 3. Compliments: Genuine compliments are often appreciated, but be sure to avoid making any comments that could be perceived as offensive or superficial. 4. Current events or pop culture: Discussing recent events or popular culture topics can help demonstrate that you're a well-informed individual and can provide material for a lighthearted conversation. 5. Personal experiences: Share stories or interesting personal experiences, as they can provide a glimpse into your character and help spark a more intimate connection. It is important to remember that every person is different, and some individuals may not be open to engaging in conversation at a bar. Always pay close attention to body language and verbal cues, and respect personal boundaries. If someone seems uninterested in talking, it is essential to recognize that signal and not push the issue further. In conclusion, both questions touch upon the interaction and dating aspect, but they are fundamentally different questions. The first focuses on how to avoid being labeled as a \\"creepy old man,\\" while the second question deals with initiating and maintaining conversation with women in social settings such as bars. By reviewing and implementing these guidelines, one can improve their social skills and understanding of how to interact respectfully with others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Test sentence: \\"The twins might have both been at the party.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence? *unacceptable; *acceptable;","completion":"The test sentence, \\"The twins might have both been at the party,\\" is indeed an acceptable and grammatically correct English sentence. In this analysis, I will break down the elements of the sentence to provide a detailed explanation of why it is correct. Firstly, let's identify the main parts of the sentence: 1. Subject: The twins 2. Auxiliary Verbs: might have 3. Main Verb: been 4. Adverb: both 5. Prepositional Phrase: at the party Now, let's analyze these components in further detail. 1. Subject: \\"The twins\\" is the subject of the sentence, serving as the main focus of the statement. The noun \\"twins\\" is plural, which allows for the use of \\"both\\" later in the sentence when referring to the two individuals. The article \\"the\\" is correctly used as a specifier, indicating that we are talking about particular twins (probably mentioned earlier in a conversation or context). 2. Auxiliary Verbs: \\"Might have\\" is a combination of the modal auxiliary verb \\"might\\" and the auxiliary verb \\"have.\\" The modal verb \\"might\\" is used to express possibility or uncertainty, whereas \\"have\\" is used for perfect verb tenses. In this sentence, \\"might have\\" correctly precedes the past participle \\"been\\" to form the modal perfect verb tense, which describes an uncertain or possible event in the past. 3. Main Verb: \\"Been\\" is the past participle form of the verb \\"to be.\\" It is appropriately paired with the auxiliary verbs \\"might have\\" to create the modal perfect verb tense. This structure properly conveys the sense of uncertainty, probability, or possibility regarding the presence of the twins at the party. 4. Adverb: \\"Both\\" is an adverb, used to emphasize that the action or state applies to each of the two subjects mentioned (i.e., the twins). The placement of \\"both\\" between the auxiliary verbs and the main verb is correct, as it effectively modifies the verb \\"been.\\" 5. Prepositional Phrase: \\"At the party\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides details about where the possible action occurred. The preposition \\"at\\" is followed by the noun phrase \\"the party,\\" which serves as the object of the preposition. Thus, the test sentence \\"The twins might have both been at the party\\" correctly follows the rules of English grammar, forming a coherent and meaningful statement that expresses the possibility that both twins were present at the party. As a result, the sentence is both detailed and acceptable in terms of its grammatical construction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

There are several aspects and clues in the review that indicate the customer's satisfaction with their purchase and experience on Amazon. Let's break down the review into components to analyze why this is a positive review. 1. Title: \\"HAPPY\\" - The title of the review itself already conveys the customer's happiness and satisfaction with their purchase. Using an all-caps word that directly expresses a positive emotion leaves no doubt about the customer's feelings in this case. 2. Review content: The reviewer shares the story of their son's efforts in searching for the desired video all over town and on Redbox, which highlights the importance and value of the video to the family. After discovering it on Amazon for a low price, they couldn't resist purchasing it. 3. Condition of the video: The reviewer mentions that the video is in \\"Perfect condition,\\" indicating that their expectations were met or even exceeded regarding the quality of the product they received.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the original name of the person whose early work was published primarily in magazines? , can you please find it? André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known. They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.

The more authentic... the better. Hole-in-the-wall? Great! Nobody speaks a lick of English? Perfect! C grade from the health dept? As long as the food tastes good and I don't get sick! So when some of my Mexican friends invited me to dinner at Los Molcajetes on Eastern, I figured I would feast as if I was south of the border. When I walked in, I thought the ambience was decent. Servers were friendly and the chips & salsa were really good. I ordered a Corona and was disappointed that the beer wasn't that cold. My friends ordered what they called Mexican Cola, which is basically Coke bottled in glass bottles in Mexico. They had several TV's on Hispanic channels that were blaring so loud we could hardly talk. We ordered an appetizer dish of mini tacos that were covered in shredded lettuce, sliced avocados, and piled high with Mexican cheese. This was delicious!!! I told the server that I wanted to order the dish that they were famous for and she recommended the Molcajetes, which I later learned was basically the bowl that it was served in. For 7 it was a bargain. The actual meal was okay. A bowl that was filled with everything but the kitchen sink. Beef, chicken, shrimp, grilled green onions, avocado, tomatoes... all drenched in a spicy sauce. It was okay. Perhaps more suitable for sharing because it was huge. For 17, not bad considering it would've fed 2+. During our meal, some guy started walking around with a stack of bootleg dvd's selling them for 5 each. Odd. Haha. As we finished our meal, a mariachi band asked each table if they wanted a song. If you pay them, they stand around your table playing music so loud that you can't even hear yourself think. I felt that the restaurant was a real miss. Nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations. They bring out a sombrero and put it on the birthday customer and sing to them. They have a tambourine going and clap really loud. At the end of the song, the guys in the kitchen scream and blow on that loud, obnoxious vuvuzela horn that they blow at soccer games.

Positive sentiments: 1. The reviewer loves authentic Mexican food, 2. Excitement about going to dinner at Los Molcajetes, 3. Ambience is decent, 4. Servers are friendly, 5. Chips and salsa are good, 6. Appetizer dish of mini tacos is delicious, 7. The famous Molcajetes dish is recommended and is a bargain, 8. The meal portions are large, suitable for sharing, and relatively affordable. Negative sentiments: 1. The beer is not cold enough, 2. TVs are too loud, making it hard to talk, 3.

The reviewer won't be returning. Looking at the positive and negative sentiments, the reviewer appears to have mixed feelings about their experience at Los Molcajetes. The positive sentiments primarily revolve around the food, whereas the negative sentiments focus on various off-putting aspects of the restaurant atmosphere and specific situations. However, the closing statement, \\"I won't be back,\\" suggests that the negative aspects of the experience outweighed the positive aspects for the reviewer. Additionally, the reviewer encourages others to try the restaurant themselves, implying that their experience may not be representative of the typical experience at Los Molcajetes.

As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The people who built Stonehenge in Southern England thousands of years ago had wild parties, eating barbecued pigs and breaking pottery. This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4,600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the Pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive man-made circular dirt wall, or \\"henge\\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \\"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\\", says Mike Parker-Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away half-eaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead s in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge. Parker-Pearson believes Stonehenge was like a cemetery where ancient Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors. The recent discovery of the village within the Durrington Walls shows that Stonehenge didn't stand alone but was part of a much bigger religious site, according to Parker-Pearson.People still come to worship and celebrate at Stonehenge today. They meet there when the sun sets on the shortest day of winter and when it rises on the longest day of summer. But the days of barbecuing whole pigs...

We will explore some of the possible scenarios below. 1. Playing: One possibility is that the man is indeed playing, perhaps engaged in a game with friends or family members, like catch or dodgeball. Tossing a ball back and forth is a common form of enjoyment and physical activity at the beach. 2. Exercising or Practicing Sports: The man may not be playing, but rather engaging in physical exercise or practicing for a particular sport that involves throwing a ball. For example, he could be a baseball or American football player working on his throwing technique or strength. In this context, the act of throwing a ball would serve a specific purpose and may not be considered \\"playing.\\" 3. Training a Pet: The man could be at the beach with his dog, throwing the red ball for the dog to fetch. In this scenario, the primary focus would be on the dog's activity, while the man is simply facilitating his pet's play and exercise. 4. Occupational or Therapeutic Reason: The man could be involved in a task related to his occupation or a therapeutic exercise, such as a physical therapy session. For instance, he might be a lifeguard practicing throwing a rescue buoy, or perhaps a patient recovering from an arm or shoulder injury and following a prescribed exercise regimen that includes throwing a ball. 5. Random or Meaningless Action: It's even possible that the man's action has no particular goal or purpose, or is simply a spontaneous one-time gesture, such as casually tossing a red ball found lying on the beach. In this case, it would not be accurate to describe the man as \\"playing.\\" Thus, while it may be tempting to assume that the man is playing, it would be an oversimplification to draw this conclusion solely from the given information.

You can even try to hide the tutorial altogether blending it seamlessly into the game or display all of the tutorial all at once. No matter what you do, make sure that it feels natural within your game. The world is the environments in which your player will play the game. How expansive will your world be? How challenging? How will you indicate that an area should be explored? That it shouldn't? These are things you'll need to consider. These are the internal rules of the game. You'll want to decide on a rule system and make sure that it's balanced and consistent. The best way to do this is to look at what other games do right or wrong in this area. The levels are the individual chunks of the game, the \\"episodes\\" that the player has to get through to make it to the end of the game. The levels should be engaging and just the right amount of challenging. They should also be physically laid out in a way that makes sense. You'll need to design all the content, like the items that can be interacted with, the characters themselves, the environmental items, etc. This can be extremely time consuming so plan ahead! Try to find clever ways to recycle things without making them seem repetitive. The interface includes things like the menus and UI. You want these to be easy to navigate and natural to use. Take cues from your favorite games but remember that generally the simpler the better. If an 8-year-old can figure it out, you're set. Having controls which feel natural are key to players really enjoying and getting the most out of your game. Remember to keep things simple and streamlined. When in doubt, conform to standardized control systems. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article discusses various aspects of game design, emphasizing the importance of creating a natural and engaging tutorial, building an expansive and challenging game world, establishing consistent internal rules, designing captivating levels, and creating a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls.

This can protect your hands from being bitten by live bed bugs and the gloves will prevent you from coming into contact with blood from smashed bed bugs. If you don't have any gloves around, wrap a plastic bag over your hand before looking for the bed bugs. Adult bed bugs are around 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) long and they have 6 legs. A bed bug that's recently fed on blood will be bright red and round. Once it digests the blood, it will turn a darker brown color and become flat. If the bed bug hasn't fed in a while, it will be a pale brown color. Since bed bugs feed on blood, they can leave behind red or rusty stains if they get smashed. The color may be bright red if the bed bug was recently crushed or the stain may be dark if the bed bug was smashed a while ago. The stains might look like single drops of blood or there will be smears and streaks. Bed bug excrement will look like very small black spots (about this size: •). The excrement can stain the fabric that's underneath it, so you may see dark streaks as well. You should also look for small pale white eggs that are around 1 millimetre (0.10 cm) in size. You may also see pale skins that the bed bug nymphs shed as they grow larger.

In this psychological thriller, a very pregnant Francesca (Patty Duke) travels from Los Angeles to Minnesota to meet her late husband's mother, Mrs. Kinsolving, whom she has never met before. Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her.While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury.That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs. Kinsolving, and it is menacing. Meanwhile, Mrs. Kinsolving discovers that the family Bible has been opened to the page detailing the date of Maria Kinsolving's death. Mrs. Kinsolving informs Kenny that Francesca knows Maria is dead, but does not think she is aware that Kenny is hiding in the mansion. The next morning, Mrs. Kinsolving announces that the blizzard has cleared enough for a driver to take Francesca into town to take the bus back to Los Angeles.At breakfast, the driver arrivesâand it is Kenny. Francesca quickly tells Mrs. Kinsolving that she left her gloves in her third floor room and she needs to retrieve them. Instead, she gets her baby from the attic, hides the baby under her coat and flees the mansion. However, Mrs. Kinsolving spots Francesca running away and yells for Kenny to get her. He takes chase, and Kathleen notices. Francesca sees Kenny is quickly gaining ground, and she darts into the carriage house in an attempt to elude him.

Water your plants after you prune them.\\"","completion":"Title: Essential Pruning Tips for Healthy and Vibrant Perennials Introduction: Pruning perennials is an essential task for gardeners who seek to maintain their plants' health, vigor, and overall appearance. Proper pruning encourages new growth, replaces old growth, and can even prolong the life of your favorite plants. This guide outlines key steps to sterilize your pruning equipment, trim away unhealthy parts of your plants, shape your perennials, and care for them post-pruning. Step 1: Sterilize Pruning Equipment Regardless of whether you are using pruning shears, loppers, or even a simple pair of scissors, it is crucial to sterilize your equipment before use. Sterilization is essential for preventing the spread of diseases and pests from one plant to another. To sterilize your pruning equipment, simply follow these steps: - Fill a container with a solution of 10% bleach and 90% water. - Soak your pruning equipment for at least 30 seconds in the solution. - Remove the equipment and allow it to air-dry before use. Step 2: Identify and Remove Unhealthy Plant Parts When pruning perennials, it's essential to start by identifying and removing any unhealthy parts of the plant. This includes any dead, diseased, or damaged growth. Removing these parts encourages healthy new growth while eliminating potential sources of disease or pest infestations. To trim unhealthy parts of your plants, follow these general guidelines: - Cut away dead or yellowing leaves and stems. - Remove any growth that appears diseased or infested with pests. - Cut back any damaged stems or leaves which may have been caused by environmental stress or physical damage. Step 3: Prune for Shape and Size Once you have removed any unhealthy plant parts, it's time to focus on shaping your perennials. Properly shaping perennials promotes growth and improves the plant's overall appearance. Here are some general tips for pruning perennials for shape: - Determine the desired height and shape of the plant. - Begin by removing any crowded or crossing stems to promote airflow and reduce the risk of disease. - Prune back older growth to stimulate new growth and keep the plant looking vibrant. - Trim plants to achieve the desired shape, taking care to make clean cuts at an angle to promote healthy healing. Step 4: Water After Pruning Lastly, it's essential to water your perennials after pruning. This helps the plants recover from the stress of pruning, as well as promoting the growth of new stems and leaves. When watering your plants, avoid overhead watering which could potentially lead to the development of fungal diseases on the newly exposed cut surfaces. Instead, water at the base of the plant, making sure the soil is evenly moist but not overly saturated. Conclusion: Pruning is an essential component of maintaining healthy and vibrant perennials in your garden. By following the steps outlined in this guide, including sterilizing pruning equipment, trimming away unhealthy plant parts, shaping your perennials, and watering them after pruning, you'll be well on your way to a beautiful and thriving garden of lush, flourishing perennials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We liked the comedy show more than we liked the play because the performers interacted with us less during the","completion":"latter, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the humor and wit of the comedy show without any distractions or disruptions. The well-crafted jokes, impeccable comic timing, and the natural chemistry between the comedians on stage captivated us from the beginning, leaving us in stitches and gasping for breath due to the continuous laughter. The comedians managed to create an atmosphere of merriment, where we could forget our daily stresses and simply bask in the joy of shared laughter, which is a highly therapeutic and bonding experience. As the comedy show progressed, we discovered the intricacies of the comedic sketches, the satirical satire of current events and culture, and the self-deprecating wit that provided an intelligent, yet lighthearted entertainment. The comedians effortlessly connected with the audience, establishing a sense of camaraderie that made everyone feel included and part of the experience. This intimate connection was absent in the play we had seen earlier, which contributed to our preference for the comedy show. In contrast, the play that we attended, despite being a well-executed production with a talented cast and crew, failed to fully engage us in the same manner that the comedy show managed to do. The storyline, although intriguing, did not elicit the same level of emotional investment from us. Moreover, the feeling of being mere passive observers, rather than actively participating members of the audience, made for a less captivating experience overall. Additionally, the format of the play, being a more structured and formal type of entertainment, could not provide the same level of spontaneity and fun that the comedy show did. The comedy show encouraged playful heckling, allowing for unexpected interactions that added to the overall enjoyment. This gave the comedy show a certain dynamism and unpredictable quality that kept the audience on their toes and more engaged. In comparison, the play remained rigidly confined to its established script, offering little opportunity for surprises or audience connection. In conclusion, our preference for the comedy show over the play can be attributed to a number of factors, including the immersive nature of comedic performances, the ability to establish a strong connection with the audience, and the unpredictable and spontaneous aspect that kept the audience engaged and entertained throughout the entire show. The play, while undoubtedly a form of art that holds great value, simply did not offer the same level of entertainment and enjoyment in that specific instance, leading to our lasting fondness for the comedy show experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The new administration had already begun exploring possible diplomatic options, retracing many of the paths traveled by its predecessors.U.S. envoys again pressed the Taliban to turn Bin Laden \\"over to a country where he could face justice\\" and repeated, yet again, the warning that the Taliban would be held responsible for any al Qaeda attacks on U.S. interests.

Clarke and the CIA's Cofer Black renewed the push to aid the Northern Alliance. Clarke suggested starting with modest aid, just enough to keep the Northern Alliance in the fight and tie down al Qaeda terrorists, without aiming to overthrow the Taliban. Rice, Hadley, and the NSC staff member for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told us they opposed giving aid to the Northern Alliance alone. They argued that the program needed to have a big part for Pashtun opponents of theTaliban. They also thought the program should be conducted on a larger scale than had been suggested. Clarke concurred with the idea of a larger program, but he warned that delay risked the Northern Alliance's final defeat at the hands of the Taliban.

Some of these mentions refer to the same person, place, or thing. Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer.

Passage: The first years of the 14th century were marked by famines, culminating in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn. These troubles were followed in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe during the following three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, about one-third of the population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague throughout the rest of the 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages. Output:","completion":"Before writing the questions, let's break down the passage: 1. The passage starts with discussing the Great Famine of 1315–17 which was caused by climate change and its effects on agriculture. 2. The passage then moves on to describe the Black Death, a pandemic that killed about one-third of Europe's population in 1347. 3. The consequences of the Black Death are mentioned: increased wages due to scarcity of workers, lower demand for food, popular uprisings, and an increase in piety. 4. The passage ends with the mention of the plague returning and its continuous effects on Europe. Now, let's write questions that evaluate one's understanding of these references: 1. What were the causes of the Great Famine of 1315–17 mentioned in the passage? Answer: The slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, bad weather causing crop failures. 2. How did the Black Death affect the European population? Answer: The death toll was about 35 million people, about one-third of the population. 3. Why did wages rise after the Black Death? Answer: Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. 4. Which popular uprisings were mentioned in the passage as a consequence of the Black Death? Answer: The jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. 5.

Both questions are seeking advice on how to appropriately and effectively reject or decline a request or offer from someone. Let me provide a detailed and long answer on the best way to say \\"NO.\\" 1. Be honest but respectful: It's important to be truthful about your reasons for saying no, but also considerate of the person making the request. A simple and honest explanation that conveys respect is the foundation of a polite decline. For example: \\"I appreciate that you thought of me for this opportunity, but I'm unable to commit to it at the moment.\\" 2. Use assertive communication: Use assertive language to express your decision, reinforcing that your decision is based on your feelings and needs, not malicious intent. You can say something like, \\"I understand that you need help with this project, but given my current workload, I cannot take on any additional responsibilities.\\" 3. Offer an alternative: Sometimes, proposing another solution or suggesting a different person for the task may soften the blow of a rejection. For example: \\"Unfortunately, I can't assist you this time, but I can recommend someone else who might be able to help you.\\" 4. Be direct yet tactful: It's crucial to be straightforward in communicating your decline, avoiding ambiguous statements that might give the asker false hope. However, using tactful language can help the person understand your decision. For example: \\"I cannot take up this offer now, as it isn't aligned with my current priorities. I hope you understand.\\" 5. Show empathy: Acknowledge the feelings of the person making the request and express empathy for their situation. This helps them see that you understand their point of view and are not dismissing their needs. For example: \\"I know how much this means to you, and I wish I could help, but I'm unable to commit to this right now.\\" 6. Express gratitude: Thank the person for thinking of you or offering the opportunity. Showing gratitude can help soften the rejection and demonstrate a positive attitude. For example: \\"Thank you for considering me, but I won't be able to participate this time.\\" 7. Use appropriate body language: Non-verbal cues play a significant role in communication. Maintain eye contact, keep a relaxed posture, and avoid crossing your arms. This way, you convey an open and honest demeanor, making the rejection seem less hostile. 8. Stand firm in your decision: Be confident in your decision and avoid backtracking, as this may create confusion. You might need to reiterate your stance politely if the person is persistent. For example: \\"I understand your position, but my decision remains the same. I cannot take part in this.\\" In summary, the best way to say \\"NO\\" is by being honest, respectful, assertive, and empathetic while offering alternatives and showing gratitude. Use appropriate body language and maintain a confident but polite demeanor to communicate your decision effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, it seems like the user is requesting the addition of a video call feature to the app. The user's review does not provide any other positive or negative feedback about the app. They simply provide a suggestion for an added feature, which implies that they might have found the app useful to some extent, but the lack of a video call function could be a limiting factor for them. Taking both the user's suggestion and the absence of clear positive feedback into account, I would recommend \\"Maybe\\" to a friend if they were looking for an app with the video call feature already built-in. It is important to consider the user's main concern and focus on that aspect while evaluating the app. However, it would also be valuable to explore the app further to familiarize oneself with its available features and performance. Since the given review does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the app's pros and cons, a personal assessment would be necessary before making a recommendation. Moreover, the friend's requirements, preferences, and the presence (or lack) of alternative options would also be influential factors in the final decision. In conclusion, the limited information from the review makes it difficult to provide a definitive stance on recommending the app to a friend. The best course of action is to suggest a \\"Maybe\\" while encouraging further exploration of the app and considering individual preferences and needs. Additionally, the developers may take the user's feedback into account and introduce the requested video call feature in a future update, which would potentially make the app more appealing and increase the likelihood of a recommendation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - The Euphrates (Sumerian: : \\"Buranuna\\", : \\"Purattu\\", : \\"al-Furt\\", : \\"Prt\\", : \\"Yeprat\\", : \\"Perat\\", ) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia.

Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- No one at the Railway Golf Club in the heart of Nairobi quite remembers if Barack Obama, Sr., the father of the 44th U.S. president, ever played here when he was a high-flying civil servant in the 1960s . Perhaps he played up the road at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club, the oldest of the city's six golf establishments, someone suggests. The club scene was certainly the natural ecosystem for the pipe-smoking Harvard-educated economist, and the hordes of other young Africans just returned from the world's top universities to take over their newly independent country.

This can be seen by observing how different global events and milestones have impacted the way various countries and individuals view the United States. One significant influence on the global perception of America was the end of the Cold War. This ushered in a new era of globalization, with America emerging as a unipolar power in a post-Soviet landscape. As the United States embraced international trade and its economy boomed, many people around the world began to view America as a land of opportunity and a global leader. The election of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States further shaped international views of America. Obama, who had a Kenyan father and served as the first African-American president of the United States, represented a break from the country's predominantly white political leadership. This development was met with enthusiasm and hope in many parts of the world, especially in Africa, where numerous people saw it as a sign of progressive change and a testament to the possibility of equal opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds. However, the perception of America was not always positive over the years. The United States' foreign policy, particularly its involvement in the Middle East and other parts of the world, has been a cause of resentment and anti-American sentiment in certain regions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the use of drone strikes, have attracted criticism and contributed to negative views of the United States among some global citizens. Additionally, the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president and his subsequent policies and rhetoric, such as prioritizing American interests first, calling for a ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, and introducing measures that affected immigrants and minorities, sparked controversy and debate around the world. Consequently, perceptions of America shifted, with some people viewing the country as more inward-focused, less welcoming, and increasingly polarized. In conclusion, the world's perception of America has evolved and changed over the years, impacted by significant events, political developments, and various global trends. The United States' position as a leading global power and its role in shaping the world has contributed to diverse and nuanced views of the country across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. just finished lunch...it's kinda a late! @ least i'm eat! Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by this tweet is a combination of self-awareness, mild frustration, and ultimately, a sense of satisfaction or relief. The tweet indicates that the tweeter has just finished eating lunch, albeit later than their typical or preferred lunchtime. This suggests that they are conscious of their mealtime habits and might feel a slight sense of annoyance or even guilt that they ate lunch later than usual. The use of casual language and colloquial expressions like \\"kinda\\" and \\"at least\\" further illustrates a certain level of informality and familiarity with their audience. This informality can serve to dampen any perceived negativity associated with their late lunch while also acknowledging that a late lunch is not an ideal situation. The tweeter, using \\"@ least,\\" makes it a point to emphasize that they were eating, and from this, we can infer that they are trying to communicate two things: first, that a late lunch is not as bad as skipping a meal altogether; and second, that they are maintaining a positive attitude about the situation. Additionally, the use of an exclamation point at the end of the tweet may suggest excitement or enthusiasm. The tweeter could be using the exclamation point to show that, despite the late timing of their lunch, they are feeling a sense of accomplishment or enjoyment from having eaten. It is also possible that they are trying to create an inviting or light-hearted tone to encourage engagement with their audience. In summary, the sentiment embodied by this tweet is a mix of mild frustration due to eating lunch later than intended but also lighthearted satisfaction from having consumed the meal. The casual language and use of an exclamation point convey a friendly and upbeat tone, inviting their audience to share in their experience and possibly even engage with the tweet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Smerinthus minor (lesser eyed hawkmoth) is a moth of the family Sphingidae. It was described by Mell in 1937. It is a montane species found from the Taibai Shan area, western Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China eastwards along the Qinling to southern Shanxi and then north to just west of Beijing. It has also been recorded from the Miaofeng Mountains near Beijing and the Wuling Mountains in Hunan. Can we infer the following? The lesser eyed hawkmoth originated in Russian.","completion":"To determine if we can infer that the lesser eyed hawkmoth originated in Russia, let's examine the information provided step-by-step: 1. The lesser eyed hawkmoth (Smerinthus minor) is a moth of the family Sphingidae. This piece of information tells us about the moth's classification, which doesn't provide any insight into its origin. 2. It was described by Mell in 1937. This statement tells us when the moth was described by a researcher named Mell. This doesn't give us information about the moth's origin either. 3. It is a montane species found from the Taibai Shan area, western Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, China eastwards along the Qinling to southern Shanxi and then north to just west of Beijing. This information provides us with the moth's habitat range, which is in China. It does not mention Russia or any regions nearby. 4. It has also been recorded from the Miaofeng Mountains near Beijing and the Wuling Mountains in Hunan. Again, this statement gives additional information about the moth's habitat range, but all locations mentioned are within China. Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the lesser eyed hawkmoth originated in Russia. Its habitat range is primarily within China, and no connections to Russia have been mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If \\"Two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air.\\", does this mean that \\"Two men playing with a dog in the playground\\"?","completion":"No, the two phrases describe completely different scenarios despite both featuring interactions between individuals and animals. The phrase \\"two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air\\" refers to an image or situation involving two men dressed in a western or cowboy-like fashion, together with a brown horse that is performing an action known as a kick, where the hind legs of the horse are swiftly and powerfully raised into the air. This scenario could potentially take place on a ranch, farm, or countryside setting, where horses are typically found, and the western attire of the men could indicate a rural or culturally associated connection with the location or activity. On the other hand, \\"two men playing with a dog in the playground\\" describes a completely different situation. This phrase suggests that two men are interacting with a dog, potentially playing a game or engaging in a fun activity, within a playground setting. A playground is a recreational area typically designed for children, sometimes featuring slides, swings, and other play structures. The presence of a dog in this setting would likely be because the two men are either dog owners or dog lovers who have brought the dog to play in a place where pets are allowed. The attire of the men is not mentioned in this phrase, and the animal involved is a dog rather than a horse. In conclusion, while both phrases depict scenarios where people are interacting with animals, they describe different situations, settings, animals, and potentially even different cultural contexts. \\"Two men in western attire with a brown horse kicking into the air\\" refers to a situation involving a horse and men dressed in western clothing, likely set in a rural or western environment. In contrast, \\"two men playing with a dog in the playground\\" describes a more urban or suburban recreational situation, where the men are engaged in play with a dog within a playground, and their attire is not specified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill Shine Steps Out From Behind the Scenes to Lead Fox News Andrea Tantaros, a daytime host, said that when she complained about Mr. Ailes to Mr. Shine, he held an issue of Variety with Mr. Ailes’s picture on the cover and said, “Don’t fight this.” Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes’s harassing her. Laurie Luhn, a former booker at Fox, told New York magazine that Mr. Ailes enlisted Mr. Shine to recommend doctors and make travel arrangements for her while she was involved in a relationship with Mr. Ailes. Mr. Shine has told associates that he never knew that the two were romantically involved. In the television industry, Mr. Shine’s promotion was taken as a sign that Rupert Murdoch, who is now executive chairman of Fox News, does not intend a full-scale removal of people who worked closely with Ailes. It also suggested that Mr. Murdoch is enamored of Mr. Shine, who is now tasked with leading Fox News as CNN’s ratings surge and some popular anchors have suggested they may retire or leave the network. Silver-haired and bearded — with a facial scar picked up from a rowdy night in college — Mr. Shine is a Long Island native, who grew up past where the island’s electrified train tracks end. After college, he worked as a producer at local stations there. He married a fellow producer, Darla Seneck, and met Mr. Hannity, who was soon to start at Fox News. Producing “Hannity & Colmes,” Mr. Shine showed a knack for earning ratings and managing talent, quickly winning Mr. Ailes’s trust. When Ms. Van Susteren was lured to Fox from CNN, Mr. Shine was put in charge of her prime-time show. In news meetings, Mr. Shine is known less for voicing strident political views than for suggesting segments that prove popular with viewers, like stories about the gas tax. At Christmastime, he treats executive producers to lunch at a Midtown steakhouse. He can also be blunt when he needs to be. When Liz Claman, a Fox Business anchor, complained to Mr. Shine last year about what she viewed as too much politics in the coverage, Mr. Shine dismissed her complaint by noting that her ratings were among the lowest on the channel, according to a former employee at the network with direct knowledge of the conversation. His carrot-and-stick style impressed Mr. Ailes, who often asked Mr. Shine to handle an upset anchor. It was Mr. Shine who informed Mr. Hannity, in 2010, that he could not headline a Tea Party rally in Ohio; the two remain close. In 2004, Mr. Shine was directed by Mr. Ailes to mollify Susan Estrich, a lawyer and Fox News contributor, who was upset after the Democratic convention in Boston when fellow Democrats criticized her for appearing on the network, according to two executives familiar with the discussion. (Ms. Estrich is now defending Mr. Ailes in the harassment case brought against him by the former Fox host Gretchen Carlson.) Mr. Shine, a twin, was one of four children and grew up in a household where, according to his wife’s book, his parents sometimes went weeks without speaking. “He always said he would never want this for his marriage,” Darla Shine wrote, describing her husband as someone who doted on their children, and a romantic who likes to dance on dates. “Eat your hearts out,” she wrote. “He makes the beds on the weekend and will even do a few loads of laundry (including folding and putting away).” Ms. Shine’s book, published in 2005 by Judith Regan, then an executive at Fox News’s parent company, was a response to the series “Desperate Housewives.” The book urged women to “shut up, stop whining, and for goodness’ sake, stop nagging your husband.” Ms. Shine appeared on the “Today” show, and Mr. Shine told Newsday that he was unembarrassed by the sections in the book about the couple’s intimate life. “Hopefully, it’ll start a conversation between women and men and husbands and wives,” he told the paper. For Mr. Shine, it was a rare foray into the spotlight. In 20 years at Fox, he has eaten lunch at Michael’s, the Midtown media hangout, just once. Only this past year did he rent a Manhattan apartment to accommodate his longer hours. “What I love most about Bill is he’s a regular guy,” Maria Bartiromo, the Fox Business anchor, wrote in an email, in which she credited Mr. Shine for an increase in her ratings. “Very steady, very smart, and very genuine. He tells you the way it is. I appreciate that.” Fox News remains influential in Republican politics, but Mr. Shine is not registered in a political party. His wife, on her blog, occasionally delves into politics, writing last month, “I am afraid of our debt, afraid for my children, afraid we have lost the American Dream.” She has also described her concerns about the health effects of vaccinations. She writes glowingly about Mr. Shine. Among the glimpses into their life are photographs from last year’s White House Correspondents Dinner. In one image, Mr. Shine, in formal wear, is seen posing with eight female Fox anchors at his side. “Wow,” Ms. Shine wrote. “My husband is one lucky guy.” A version of this article appears in print on August 16, 2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Behind-the-Scenes Executive Steps Forward to Take a Starring Role at Fox News. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Bill Shine has taken on a major leadership role at Fox News following the resignation of Roger Ailes, the network's former chairman and CEO, who stepped down in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.

He has been tasked with leading Fox News as the network faces multiple challenges, including CNN's surging ratings and the potential departure of some popular anchors.

Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Charlottenlund is a suburban area on the coast north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the administrative seat of Gentofte Municipality. Bordered to the east by the Øresund, to the South by Hellerup and to the north by Klampenborg, it is one of the most wealthy areas in Denmark.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands). - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund.

Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016). - A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

Most public aquariums feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public. - Hellerup is a Danish town of Region Hovedstaden, located in the Gentofte Municipality in Denmark. It is bordered to the east by the sound Øresund and to the South by Copenhagen and counted among the most wealthy areas in Denmark. - Gentofte Kommune is an affluent and wealthy municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") in the Capital Region of Denmark (\\"Region Hovedstaden\\") on the east coast of the island of Zealand (\\"Sjælland\\") in eastern Denmark.

The strait has a length of and the width varies from to . It is wide at its narrowest point between Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden. - Tårnby Kommune is a municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") bordering Copenhagen on the island of Amager just south of Zealand (\\"Sjælland\\") in eastern Denmark. The municipality includes the islands of Saltholm and Peberholm, and covers an area of 65 km². It has a population of 42,179 (1 April 2014). Its mayor is Henrik Zimino, a member of the Social Democrats (\\"Socialdemokraterne\\") political party. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper. - The Copenhagen metropolitan area (or Metropolitan Copenhagen) is a large commuter belt (the area in which it is practical to commute to work) surrounding Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark.

The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - An \\"aquatic animal\\" is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in water for most or all of its life. It may breathe air or extract its oxygen from that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through its skin. Natural environments and the animals that live in them can be categorized as aquatic (water) or terrestrial (land). - The Øresund/Öresund/Oresund Bridge (, , hybrid name: \\"\\") is a combined railway and motorway bridge across the Øresund strait between Sweden and Denmark. The bridge runs nearly from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Amager (or, especially among older speakers) is a Danish island in the Øresund. The Danish capital, Copenhagen, is partly situated on Amager, which is connected to the much larger island of Zealand by five bridges. Amager also has a connection across the Øresund to Sweden, the Øresund Bridge. Its western part begins with a tunnel from Amager to another Danish island, Peberholm. Copenhagen Airport is located on the island, around from Copenhagen city centre. Amager is the largest island in the Øresund, and the only one with a large population. , 192,709 people live on the island, including its northern tip, Christianshavn. The northern part is included in the Copenhagen municipality. The middle part comprises Tårnby municipality, and Dragør municipality is located on the southeast part of the island. Most of the western part is land that was reclaimed from the sea from the 1930s-1950s. This enlargement, from the shallow sound towards Zealand, is known as \\"Kalveboderne\\". The enlargement has never been built-up and its soil isn't suitable for agricultural use. However the area between Dragør town and the airport is cultivated land of high quality. Amager has in the past been referred to as the \\"kitchen of Copenhagen\\". At the border of the enlargement there is an old beech forest, \\"Kongelunden\\" (The King's Grove). - Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport is the main international airport serving Copenhagen, Denmark, the entire Zealand, the Øresund Region, and a large part of southern Sweden (not only Scania). It is the largest airport in the Nordic countries with 29 million passengers in 2016 and one of the oldest international airports in Europe. It is the third-busiest airport in Northern Europe, and by far the busiest for international travel in Scandinavia. - An aquarium (plural: \\"aquariums\\" or \\"aquaria\\") is a vivarium of any size having at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept and displayed. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, aquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root \\"aqua\\", meaning water, with the suffix \\"-arium\\", meaning \\"a place for relating to\\". The aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained that plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals, so long as their numbers do not grow too large. The aquarium craze was launched in early Victorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London Zoo in 1853, and published the first manual, \\"The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea\\" in 1854. - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road. - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - A zoo (short for zoological garden or zoological park and also called an animal park or menagerie) is a facility in which animals are confined within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.

The artist had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer. The Doors formed in 1965 after Manzarek happened to meet Jim Morrison on California's Venice Beach. The legendary rock group went on to sell 100 million albums worldwide, establishing five multiplatinum discs in the U.S. Morrison died in 1971, but Manzarek carried on The Doors' legacy, continuing to work as a musician and an author. \\"I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today,\\" said Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. \\"I'm just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life and I will always miss him.\\" The band famously defied Ed Sullivan's request that they not sing the lyric \\"higher\\" when they performed \\"Light My Fire\\" on his show in 1969. A show producer approached them in the dressing room shortly before they were to perform, Manzarek recalled in an interview with CNN in 2002. Manzarek remembers the band publicly agreeing like choirboys. \\" 'Yes, sir,' we told him,\\" he recalls. \\"'Whatever you say, sir. We'll change.' (The producer) looked at Jim and said, 'You're the poet. Think of something else -- 'wire,' 'flyer.' \\" Then the Doors went out and did the song exactly as they always did. Sullivan was so furious he didn't even shake their hands. Manzarek went on to produce the Los Angeles punk band X.

What is the full name of the character who overpays his accountant? Answer the above question based on the context below: Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey). The plot resembles the premise of The Producers by Mel Brooks. Inside Shelldrake's private screening room, the \\"film within the film\\" begins.

Options: - theater - airplane - theatre - new york city - fieldhouse The answer is \\"fieldhouse\\" because","completion":"a fieldhouse is generally a large enclosed area designed for indoor sports or athletic events which might include track and field or baseball. This type of facility typically has a large central area for sports and may also contain locker rooms, showers, or other amenities. While it is theoretically possible to stage a fashion show or other event that would include a catwalk in a space like this, that is not its primary or customary usage. On the other hand, catwalks are commonly associated with theaters and theatres (the different spellings refer to the same type of establishment, just in American and British English respectively). In this context, a catwalk refers to a platform used by stagehands and technicians to access the overhead stage lights and scenery. Additionally, professional fashion shows (which are also commonly associated with the term 'catwalk') are often held in theatre spaces due to the ease of viewing provided by the stepped seating. Airplanes, more specifically large commercial ones, also have an area that could be referred to as a catwalk. It's a narrow, usually unseen walkway running the length of the plane used for maintenance, inspections and in case of emergencies. New York City is a recognized hub for fashion globally and it's common for significant fashion events, which would feature catwalks, to be held here. Therefore, out of all the options, a catwalk would be least likely to be found in a fieldhouse due to its primary function as a sports facility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this isn’t always the case, and you may need additional treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out what type of treatment you need. Back pain typically causes the following symptoms: Muscle aches. Dull, shooting, or stabbing pain. Back pain that gets worse when you bend, lift, stand, or walk. Back pain that feels better when you lie down. Try not to worry, but these symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition. Your doctor can figure out what’s causing your symptoms and can recommend the best treatments for you. See your doctor immediately to get the treatment you need. Tell your doctor how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms. While you likely don’t need to worry, back pain can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition. If this is the case, you may need additional treatment. Visit your doctor or go to an emergency room if you have the following symptoms: Bowel or bladder problems—especially if you can’t control urination. Fever. Back injury from a fall or accident. If you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse, are older than 50, or have a bone or joint disorder, the back pain is more likely to get out of control if you don’t get a thorough exam. Additionally, if you have a family history of cancer, back pain may be an early sign of spinal, colon, or ovarian cancer. You’re probably fine, but it’s a good idea to get screened just to be safe. It’s rare for back pain to be a sign of cancer, but it’s worth checking out if the back pain came out of nowhere and wasn’t triggered by physical activity. Your doctor will review your symptoms and do a physical exam. Then, they may order some simple diagnostic tests. Most of these tests will be non-invasive and painless, but you may experience some discomfort. After the tests, talk to your doctor about your diagnosis. For instance, your doctor will probably do an imaging test. You may need to complete an X-ray, MRI, CT scan, or ultrasound. In some cases, your doctor may inject you with a contrast dye so they can look for back problems, like a herniated disc, fracture, or spondylolisthesis. Your doctor can tell you about all of your treatment options. For minor back pain, exercise and over-the-counter pain relievers may be enough to help your back pain. However, they may prescribe additional medication or recommend physical therapy. For severe cases, your doctor may recommend you get surgery, but only as a last resort. Try not to worry because you have a lot of treatment options. Your doctor can help you figure out what’s best for you.","completion":"Back pain is a common issue that often resolves itself with home treatment and self-care.

Answer based on context: In week twelve, the Bears hosted the 5-6 Tennessee Titans. The Bears were 6-5 in the all-time series, most recently a 51-20 victory in 2012, though the Bears lost the last game in Chicago, a 31-24 defeat in 2008. With Jay Cutler sidelined, Matt Barkley made his first career NFL start against a Dick LeBeau-led defense that blitzed often; on second down, the Titans recorded 12 sacks, second-most in the league. For the Bears defense, they faced an offense powered by a running game featuring DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry, while quarterback Marcus Mariota led a unit that ranked eighth in the NFL in five-minute drives and a fifth-ranked third down conversion rate. Despite the recent woes, Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears needed to maintain a high morale and allow younger players to develop, both as players and as a team. On their opening drive, the Bears reached the Titans' 33-yard line before stalling and turning the ball over on downs. After the Titans punted, the Bears scored first when Barkley threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Daniel Brown, their first career touchdowns. The Titans responded with Henry's 11-yard touchdown run with four seconds left in the first quarter, followed by Mariota throwing a four-yard touchdown pass to Delanie Walker in the second quarter. Chicago attempted to score again when they entered Tennessee's red zone on their next drive, but Barkley's pass for Ben Braunecker was intercepted by Wesley Woodyard. The next two drives of the game ended with a punt before Mariota threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Rishard Matthews to give the Titans a 21-7 entering halftime. To start the second half, Connor Barth attempted a surprise onside kick, which bounced off Titan Nate Palmer as Adrian Amos recovered. The Bears took advantage to drive to the Titan's five-yard line, but were unable to score as Barkley's pass for Cameron Meredith was intercepted by Da'Norris Searcy in the endzone. Tennessee's Ryan Succop kicked field goals of 19 and 31 yards to increase the lead to 20 points. In the fourth quarter, Barkley began to lead a comeback as he led a 75-yard drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, followed by a 69-yard scoring drive that concluded with a six-yard touchdown pass to Deonte Thompson to narrow the score to 27-21. The Titans were forced to punt on their next possession with 1:56 left in the game. Barkley moved the Bears downfield with 14-, 21- and 23-yard passes to Wilson, where they reached the Titans' seven-yard line to create a first-and-goal situation with 47 seconds left. Barkley's first pass to Josh Bellamy, which would have resulted in a touchdown, was dropped. His next two passes to Brown and Thompson also fell incomplete. On fourth-and-goal, Thompson dropped a Barkley pass in the back of the endzone to result in a turnover on downs. In addition to the two late drops by Bellamy and Thompson, the Bears as a whole struggled with drops, with ten total in the game and eight in the fourth quarter.

Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses). Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and Cr2O3 additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide. When used in art glass or studio glass is colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and 'cook' times.

Is the admiration for the British royal family rooted in racism? Is it compulsory for members of the British Royal Family to serve in the armed forces? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPT: a). no b). yes","completion":"a). No, the two questions do not have the same meaning. Each question addresses a separate aspect of the British royal family and alludes to different discussions. For the first question, \\"Is the admiration for the British royal family rooted in racism?\\": The question is fundamentally asking whether the affection and esteem in which the British royal family is held are based on racist principles. The admiration for the British royal family could stem from different factors such as tradition, culture, history, and the roles they play in society. Though there might be historical connections to colonialism and imperialism, attributing the modern admiration for the royal family solely to racism is an oversimplification. It is important, however, to acknowledge and recognize the multifaceted aspects that contribute to the admiration of the British royal family, which could range from deeply ingrained societal values, fascination with the monarchy, and a genuine appreciation for the philanthropic work they do. For the second question, \\"Is it compulsory for members of the British Royal Family to serve in the armed forces?\\": This question seeks clarification on whether military service is mandatory for members of the British royal family. Historically, many members of the British royal family have served in the armed forces, predominantly due to a close relationship between the monarchy and the military. While it is not compulsory for all members of the royal family to serve, it has become somewhat of a tradition for certain members to pursue military careers, and in some cases assume ceremonial military roles. For instance, Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince Harry have all served in various branches of the military. However, this is not a formal requirement of being a member of the British royal family. It is important to note that royal family members actively involved in the military are subject to the same standards and expectations as their fellow servicemen and servicewomen. In summary, the two questions focus on different aspects of the British royal family – the first addresses the origins of admiration, potentially touching on sensitive topics like racism, while the second tackles the subject of whether military service is obligatory for the members of the monarchy. Thus, the answer is option a): No, these questions do not have the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Boats that aren't on the ocean travel across the surface of what? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - lake - ocean - tetrahedron - mirror - object Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option for answering the question \\"Boats that aren't on the ocean travel across the surface of what?\\" is lake. Lakes are large bodies of water, usually found inland, that provide an ideal environment for various types of boats to travel across their surfaces. While the term \\"lake\\" is quite general and encompasses a wide range of sizes, depths, and characteristics, they all share the common trait of providing a suitable surface for boats to traverse. Boats are designed for different purposes and environments, and many of them are adaptable to both ocean and lake settings. In comparison to the vastness of the ocean, lakes typically offer calmer waters, making it easier for smaller boats to navigate and traverse without the risk of being overwhelmed by large waves or harsh weather conditions. Recreational boating is a common activity on lakes, with a variety of watercraft available to suit different needs and preferences. Some examples include sailing boats, rowing boats, kayaks, canoes, and even motorboats. Each type of watercraft offers a unique experience for those who travel across the surface of a lake, providing opportunities for leisure, exercise, and exploration. In addition to recreational boating, lakes also provide a setting for professional boating activities such as competitive events and water-based sports. Rowing, sailing, and canoe racing are just a few examples of sports that take place on lakes. These events require a suitable body of water with relatively calm conditions, making lakes an ideal location for this type of activity. The other options provided in the question, ocean, tetrahedron, mirror, and object, are less suitable answers for the given context. While ocean and lake may both serve as travel environments for boats, the question specifically asks about boats that aren't on the ocean. Tetrahedron is a geometrical figure and is irrelevant to the context of boats and water surfaces. A mirror, although associated with reflecting surfaces, cannot support the physical traversal of a boat. Lastly, an object is a general term that can refer to any item or entity, making it an unsuitable and vague answer. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question about where boats that aren't on the ocean travel across is a lake. This body of water provides an appropriate environment for boats to traverse, both for recreational and professional purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens. - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer. - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them. - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons. - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies. - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month . - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information. - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad. - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws. - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law. - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004. - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\" - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes. - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers. - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam? Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years. The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days. Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

New York (CNN) -- When Gina Keatley first moved to New York to attend culinary school, she noticed that many of her neighbors were missing limbs. \\"I lived on 99th Street across from some projects,\\" she said. \\"I would walk to the train and think, 'Why are there so many amputees?'\\" Keatley found out that many of them had to have amputations because of complications from diabetes. Diabetes can reduce blood flow to extremities and cause nerve damage, and sometimes amputations are necessary if serious infection sets in and there is severe damage to the tissue and bone. The neighborhood where Keatley lived, East Harlem, has the highest diabetes rate in Manhattan, according to city health officials. It also has the highest obesity rate: One-third of adult residents are obese or overweight. Since then, the 8-year-old and his family have been frequenting their local farmers' market in","completion":"East Harlem, joining a growing number of residents who are determined to fight the epidemic of diabetes and obesity plaguing their community. Keatley, now a certified nutritionist, took it upon herself to make a difference in the lives of the people around her, especially those who are most vulnerable to the effects of this debilitating disease. To combat the issue, Keatley established a nonprofit organization called \\"Nutrition for Life,\\" which focuses on educating residents about healthy eating habits and empowering them to make sustainable dietary changes. Through her organization, she organizes cooking classes, grocery store tours, and workshops in East Harlem schools, churches, and community centers, teaching participants how to prepare affordable and nutritious meals with ingredients easily found in their neighborhood. Realizing the importance of accessible and healthy food options in the community, Keatley also began working closely with local farmers' markets and other community organizations to help improve the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. This included advocating for more farmers' markets in the area and implementing initiatives like the \\"Double Up Food Bucks\\" program, which provides additional benefits to SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) participants when they purchase fresh produce at participating markets. In addition to increasing access to fresh and healthy food options, Keatley and her Nutrition for Life team have worked to develop culturally relevant educational materials and programs in order to resonate with East Harlem's diverse population. By taking into account cultural backgrounds, dietary preferences, and cooking traditions from different ethnicities, Keatley believes that her organization can make a genuine impact in the fight against diabetes and obesity in the community. The efforts of Keatley, her nonprofit, and the broader East Harlem community have started to show promising results. More residents are now aware of the importance of healthy eating and the potential consequences of not taking care of their bodies. They're also realizing that making healthier food choices doesn't necessarily mean giving up on the foods they love, but rather finding more balanced and nutritious alternatives. Families like the one mentioned earlier, who once faced an uncertain future due to the prevalence of diabetes and obesity in their neighborhood, have been given a newfound sense of hope. They have become regulars at the farmers' market and are actively taking charge of their own health by learning about nutrition and incorporating healthier ingredients in their daily meals. As more members of the East Harlem community take these crucial steps toward better health, the hope is that the alarming statistics plaguing this neighborhood will gradually diminish, ultimately turning the tide against this modern-day epidemic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: name = The Waterman, food = Chinese, priceRange = cheap, customer rating = average, area = city centre, familyFriendly = yes Can you represent the content in this sentence in data form?","completion":"Certainly. The information provided in the sentence can be best represented in a structured data form such as a dictionary or a relational database record in a tabular format. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs; a relational database, on the other hand, is a type of database that organizes data into tables. Here are the two formats: 1) Representation as a Python dictionary: Python dictionaries are capable of storing data in key-value pairs. In this language, the keys function as identifiers that help in sorting and calling the values attached to them. Values can be any form of information, including but not limited to strings, integers, and objects. For our purposes, the dictionary would look something like this: \`\`\`python restaurant_information = { \\"name\\": \\"The Waterman\\", \\"food\\": \\"Chinese\\", \\"priceRange\\": \\"cheap\\", \\"customer rating\\": \\"average\\", \\"area\\": \\"city centre\\", \\"familyFriendly\\": \\"yes\\" } \`\`\` In this dictionary, the keys are the identifiers, such as \\"name,\\" \\"food,\\" and \\"priceRange,\\" and the values are the related specific details like \\"The Waterman,\\" \\"cheap,\\" and \\"Chinese.\\" 2) Representation as a relational database record: In this form, each piece of data corresponds to a column in the table, while each restaurant's data makes up a single row.

Title: 25th Hour Movie plot: A canary yellow vintage Super Bee pulls up short on a New York City street, and Montgomery \\"Monty\\" Brogan gets out with his buddy Kostya to look at a dog lying in the road. The animal was mauled in a dogfight so Monty intends to shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye. Monty decides to take the dog to a nearby clinic instead.

In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested. Detectives come to Monty's apartment while he's still there. They find the drugs immediately and not after any real search, suggesting that Monty had been betrayed. Monty sold drugs for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who turned him in, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai, but he's not sure what Nikolai will do at the club that night.
