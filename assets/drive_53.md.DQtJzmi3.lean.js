This decision was taken as part of the program adjustments recommended by the International Olympic Committee to ensure gender equality in the sport and allow lightweight women's events to be added to the roster.

Who is the only 20th century president to be carved onto Mount Rushmore?","completion":"The only 20th century president to be carved onto Mount Rushmore is Theodore Roosevelt. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills region of South Dakota. The monument features the heads of four significant United States presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln—each chosen because they respective roles in the country's establishment, development, and preservation. The sculptor behind this mammoth project was Gutzon Borglum. The work began in 1927, and it took 14 years to complete, with occasional interruptions caused by weather and financial issues. Completed in 1941, Borglum died a few months before the work was declared finished. Theodore Roosevelt, the only 20th-century president on Mount Rushmore, had a considerable impact on the United States, serving as the 26th president from 1901 to 1909. He was chosen by Borglum due to his significant contributions to the development of the country. Some notable achievements during his presidency include promoting progressive policies that championed labor rights, consumer protection, and natural resource conservation. He was instrumental in the construction of the Panama Canal and was an advocate of the U.S.'s emergence as a major world power. Roosevelt's passion for conservation led to the establishment of five national parks and 18 national monuments, along with 150 national forests, setting aside over 230 million acres of public land for the generations to come. This strong commitment to conservation is one reason why he was ideal for inclusion alongside the other three remarkable American presidents on the iconic Mount Rushmore monument."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes, which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia. The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton. Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth).

Please answer a question about the following article about Alps: During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as Les Menuires. Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors. From 1980 to the present, ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts, leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline.

Would \\"The female figures Liberty and Ceres , representative of the state's motto (see next item).\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"Yes, your description of the New Jersey flag is accurate, but I will provide a more detailed answer for better understanding. The flag of New Jersey, known as the \\"State Banner\\" or \\"State Flag of New Jersey,\\" consists of the official state seal placed on a buff-colored background. The New Jersey state motto, “Liberty and Prosperity,” is also a part of the flag. The state seal, designed by Pierre Eugene du Simitiere in 1777 and officially adopted in the same year, has diverse symbols representing the values and history of the state. The main elements of the seal are: 1. The female figures Liberty and Ceres: Liberty, holding a staff with the liberty cap on top, is a representation of political freedom. Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, holding a cornucopia filled with harvested produce, signifies abundance and agricultural prosperity. These two figures not only represent the state's motto but also underscore the importance of freedom and agricultural wealth to New Jersey. 2. The blue shield with three plows: Located in the center of the seal, the blue shield symbolizes the state's commitment to governance and the significance of agriculture, as the three plows depict New Jersey's agricultural heritage. The state's long tradition of farming is an essential aspect of its prosperity. 3. The horse's head and the knight's helmet: Above the shield, there is a horse's head and a forward-facing knight's helmet. The horse, which is the official state animal, represents speed, strength, and resilience. The knight's helmet symbolizes the state's sovereignty, dignity, and protection. 4. The scroll with the state motto \\"Liberty and Prosperity\\": The state motto, inscribed on the scroll at the bottom of the state seal, refers to the fundamental principles upon which New Jersey was founded. The phrase is also a reflection of the hopes and aspirations of its citizens. In summary, the New Jersey flag features the state seal on a buff-colored background, and its primary elements - the female figures Liberty and Ceres, the blue shield with three plows, the horse's head and knight's helmet, and the scroll with the state motto - exemplify the essential values and the rich history of the state. Your description of the female figures representing the state's motto is accurate and reasonable, but it's essential to consider the other elements of the seal for a comprehensive understanding of the New Jersey flag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a mixture of both negative and positive sentiments, making it difficult to classify definitively. Initially, the review expresses a negative sentiment by stating that the book was \\"ok but not great,\\" suggesting some dissatisfaction or disappointment with the book. Furthermore, the mention of \\"no pictures sad\\" may indicate that the reviewer found the book's lack of illustrations disappointing, further emphasizing a negative sentiment. However, the reviewer quickly changes their tone and humorously states that they were \\"JUST KIDDING,\\" which might be taken as a shift to a more positive sentiment, or simply as a playful and perhaps sarcastic remark. The reference to a YouTube video, \\"cenafan363 Weapons for dummies,\\" could be seen as an attempt to divert the reader's attention away from the initial negative remarks and direct them towards something that the reviewer might find more enjoyable or entertaining, thus suggesting a more positive sentiment about the content they are recommending. In this context, the reviewer might be suggesting that the book is better than they initially described it to be, or that the YouTube content is somehow related to the book in terms of subject matter or quality.

It only took three minutes for this match when Forrest buried the rebound after Gary Harkins forced a save from Dumbarton goalkeeper Alan Martin. Harkins was again instrumental in the second goal, teeing up Forrest for an easy finish. And Forrest made it three from the penalty spot. Harkins could have had one himself; driving the ball towards goal from distance, but there was too much on the strike and it flew over the bar. Dumbarton finally showed up in the 18th minute. Greg Fleming had to punch clear in the Ayr goal, it then fell to Josh Todd, but his shot from 20 yards took a deflection on its way over. There were calls for a penalty by the United camp before the end of the first half, but it looked as though Mark Docherty timed his challenge on Nicky Devlin as he burst into the area. It was another early goal in the second half and another gift from Dumbarton. Alan Martin lost out to Harkins in the box, the keeper committed and lost, then Harkins squared to Forrest who couldn't miss for his second. Ayr wrapped up the points from the penalty spot when Devlin was brought down in the box by Daniel Harvie, and Forrest stepped up and secured his hat-trick.

To do this, we will add 10584 to both sides of the equation: 216 * o = 10584 Great! The last step is to find out what one 'o' is. We do that by dividing both sides by 216: o = 10584 / 216 When we do that, we find out o is equal to 49: o = 49 So, there you have it! The answer to the math problem is o = 49.

John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible. The hostage negotiator, Lt. Frank Grimes, stands down to let John cool off. Meanwhile, John and the eleven hostages learn more about each other. They begin to understand John's situation and support him a little as he ensures each of them receive the treatment they came to the emergency room for. One of them, Miriam, is pregnant, and her husband Steve is hoping that their first child is healthy. A young hostage, Julie, has a broken arm, and she and her boyfriend Mitch claim that a car crash caused it. Due to holes in their story, John and another hostage, Lester, conclude the two are lying and... Answer:","completion":"In the movie John Q, John Quincy Archibald's son, Michael, is suffering from an enlarged heart, also known as cardiomegaly. This condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes thickened or weakened, affecting its ability to pump blood effectively. As a result, Michael requires a heart transplant to save his life. The movie's plot revolves around the challenges John faces in trying to secure the necessary funds for his son's expensive heart transplant surgery. The minimum cost for the procedure is 250,000, with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) needed to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. Unfortunately, John discovers that his health insurance policy does not cover the surgery due to his employer's change in his work status from full-time to part-time. Despite John and Denise's efforts to raise the down payment, they can only come up with a third of the required amount. As the hospital grows impatient and releases Michael, John decides to take matters into his own hands. He goes to the emergency room armed with a handgun, takes eleven hostages, and demands that his son's name be put on the recipient list as soon as possible. Throughout the tense hostage situation, John and his hostages form a bond as they come to understand each other and his desperate predicament. They also assist in treating each other's medical conditions and uncovering the truth behind some of their stories, such as Julie and Mitch's fabricated account of their car accident. In summary, the central issue with John's son, Michael, is his enlarged heart, which necessitates a heart transplant to save his life. This serves as the catalyst for the movie's plot, highlighting the difficulties faced by families attempting to navigate healthcare systems and insurance policies, as well as the lengths a parent might go to in order to save their child's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sleeping is one of the most important things you do to take care of your body––and it helps with weight loss too! Staying well-rested will lead to more calories burned, more fat lost, and even less late-night snacking. There are many other added bonuses to getting enough sleep including increased focus and concentration levels, higher energy levels, and better decision making skills. . It takes your brain about 20 minutes to catch up with your stomach. This means that you will actually be full before your brain is able to communicate that with you. If you eat more slowly, this will help you avoid overeating and it will give your brain more time to communicate your level of fullness to the rest of your body. If you struggle with this, try chewing your food more thoroughly. Chew each bite a certain several times before swallowing. It may help to count the bites at first until your body adjusts to eating more slowly. Avoid eating when you're distracted — it's easier to overeat if you're not paying attention to what you're eating. Exercising will help you lose water weight by increasing your sweat levels, which means your body is expelling water. You will also shift some of your body’s water content into the muscles, rather than letting it remain outside the cells. Cardio and weight training are the best ways to lose weight. Try alternating your workouts between these two methods – cardio one day, weight training the next. Try doing some form of moderate to vigorous cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes 3 times per week. Running, cycling, rowing, and swimming are all forms of cardio you can do. Do weight training exercises for 30 minutes 3 times a week, like weighted squats, deadlifts, and leg presses. If you don’t currently exercise, try making a commitment to work out once a week and building from there. Weighing yourself frequently will allow you to observe weight changes and pinpoint potentially problematic behavior. People who weigh themselves more frequently are more in-tuned with changes in their weight, and are more likely to take preventative measures. Weigh yourself at the same time every day (preferably first thing in the morning) for the most consistent results. It’s normal for your weight to fluctuate from day to day, especially during menstruation. In order to be able to report your symptoms accurately to your doctor, you should keep a journal that records all of the relevant details. Write down everything you eat each day, when you exercise and for how long, and how much you weigh. You can also use an app, like MyFitnessPal, to keep track of what you're eating and how much you're exercising. There are also quite a few online tracking apps that allow women to enter information about their menstrual cycle, along with other symptoms related to their cycle. This will be a handy tool to refer back to during a conversation with your doctor.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Authorities are investigating whether Fox Lake Police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz and his son, Donald, a soldier in the Army, conducted a sham marriage with the rogue cop’s mistress to improperly take money and benefits from the Army, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Investigators have found that Joseph Gliniewicz was having an affair with a woman who had recently gotten divorced and needed money to buy food as well as health care benefits for her two children, the source said. Gliniewicz allegedly arranged for his son, Donald “D.J.” Gliniewicz to marry the woman for a brief period of time while Donald Gliniewicz served in the Army, the source said. With the addition of the family, Donald Gliniewicz would get about 1,750 a month for being married and having two children to support, the source said. Gliniewicz’s mistress would get 500, and Donald Gliniewicz would get the rest. The two were married for about a year, the source said. A dissolution of marriage was filed in Lake County at the end of 2014, records show. D.J. Gliniewicz could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday night. ||||| Gliniewicz autopsy report Disgraced Fox Lake Police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was portrayed as a hero immediately after his staged shooting death, but his personnel records, released by the village Thursday after months of delay, show a much different story: an officer who repeatedly faced complaints that he was drunk in public, deceptive and sexually harassed women. In a Feb. 1, 2009, letter sent to the village mayor, submitted by anonymous members of the Fox Lake Police Department, officers complained about Gliniewicz making threats and sexually harassing a dispatcher; having to be escorted out of bars by bouncers because he was highly intoxicated; stiffing another bar on a 300 tab; taking his family on vacation to Wisconsin in his squad car; grabbing women’s breasts at department Christmas parties; and being found repeatedly drunk in public and being belligerent with officers who confronted him. A Fox Lake dispatcher wrote in an April 2003 memo about a comment Gliniewicz made about putting “a round of bullets” in her chest. She said she couldn’t recall the exact comment, nor her response. But she said Gliniewicz then replied, “not if they don’t find the body, and there are a lot of lakes around here.” She said she initially felt threatened, but later realized he was joking. Records also show that Gliniewicz had attempted elaborate subterfuges to get himself out of trouble in the past. In 1988, a detective reported Gliniewicz to a supervisor after officers found Gliniewicz passed out behind the wheel of his pickup truck about 1 a.m. The truck was parked on the shoulder with “the engine running full-throttle” as the unconscious and unresponsive Gliniewicz sat with this foot on the gas. The letter indicates the detective arrived at the scene after officers who responded could not rouse Gliniewicz. The detective had the truck towed and took Gliniewicz home, only to find the next day that Gliniewicz had reported the truck stolen. When he called Gliniewicz’s home, the answering machine message said Gliniewicz was out looking for his truck. When questioned by the detective — the same officer who had driven him home the night before — Gliniewicz said he had been drinking at a bar and could not recall what happened to his truck, but that his roommate’s girlfriend had seen the truck parked at his house about 4 a.m. The new revelations about Gliniewicz came as the Fox Lake village administrator said Thursday that reports that Gliniewicz had explored hiring a hit man to kill her were “quite unbelievable and almost surreal.” “My concern is my family. It’s quite unbelievable and almost surreal,” Village Administrator Anne Marrin said at a news conference Thursday. Marrin said she did not think her safety was at risk now. Authorities said Wednesday that Gliniewicz staged his suicide on Sept. 1 to look like a murder. He faced mounting pressure as Marrin audited the finances of a police youth group he led. The rogue officer feared that she would discover that he had been stealing tens of thousands of dollars meant for kids that he spent on porn, a gym membership, his mortgage and vacations. Shortly after she was hired, Marrin began auditing all village programs. In March, she started a review of the village’s police Explorers program, a youth program for teens interested in law enforcement careers run by Gliniewicz. In text messages released by the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force on Wednesday, Gliniewicz was clearly distressed that the audit would reveal his embezzlement from the youth group, and he seemed to consider Marrin an enemy. Gliniewicz said he had “MANY SCENARIOS” to get rid of his unsuspecting adversary, from discrediting her by planting evidence to dumping her body in a remote nature area near the Wisconsin and Illinois border. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that Gliniewicz had explored hiring a hit man to kill her. He had reached out to a high-ranking member of the infamous Outlaw motorcycle gang, authorities said. Investigators also found cocaine in Gliniewicz’s desk, and given his mentions of planting evidence, speculated that he was considering planting it on Marrin, authorities said. At the press conference, Marrin said she was unaware of her role as Gliniewicz’s nemesis. The two seldom talked, usually only ahead of village events where the Explorers helped police manage traffic and parking, she said. “Most of our interactions were very pleasant,” Marrin said. Marrin said there were numerous questions once she began looking into the Explorers: Gliniewicz could not provide a roster of participants or parental consent forms, and the group seemed not to have a budget. Gliniewicz had direct control over program funds, Marrin said. “There were a lot of red flags,” she said. The day before Gliniewicz staged his suicide, Marrin had asked him to complete an inventory of Explorers equipment kept at a village building, a requirement for the village to review its liability insurance. Gliniewicz failed to turn over the list, and in a text message to an unnamed person, he wrote: “She now has demanded a complete inventory of exploder [sic] central and a financial report . . . FML.” Marrin emailed Gliniewicz and asked for the inventory list again the morning of Sept. 1. “He said, ‘I will have it to you by noon or 1 o’clock,’” Marrin said. Shortly before 8 a.m. that morning, Gliniewicz radioed dispatchers to say he was investigating “suspicious activity” at a remote abandoned cement plant and saw three men there. Back-up officers Gliniewicz had requested found him fatally shot. In the days that followed, hundreds of police joined the search for suspects, and Fox Lake residents hosted fundraisers and mourned the 30-year-veteran officer with prayer vigils and a hero’s funeral. Investigators this week said Gliniewicz committed suicide, staging his death to make it appear he had died in struggle with his fictional assailants. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video The Gliniewicz family reportedly took part in a sham marriage to boost the military benefits to the lieutenant’s son. Sources tell WGN Investigates that officials were briefed about the possibility prior to Wednesday’s news conference where Lt. Joe Gliniewicz’s death was declared a suicide. WGN is told the information was gathered during the investigation of the lieutenant’s life as authorities came to the suicide conclusion. According to sources, Gliniewicz, who was married, had an affair with a woman. He later arranged to have that woman marry his son, D.J. Gliniewicz, who is in the army in order to boost the military benefits for D.J., since being married could add up to thousands more per year. WGN Investigates learned that marriage did not last long between D.J. and a woman named Kathryn Grams. The marriage was dissolved just after Christmas, 2014. Sources say the question now is whether D.J. could face court martial as information about the sham army marriage comes to light. WGN obtained part of Lt. Gliniewicz's personnel file that details a history of complaints going back two decades. They include: His failure to show up at work on occasion. An incidence when he passed out in his truck, with the engine running, after a night of drinking. Officers were unable to wake him. They took him home. The next day Gliniewicz had no memory of the incident and thought his truck had been stolen. There are also complaints from bar owners complaining about Gliniewicz drinking to excess. He was accused of groping a woman's breast at a Christmas party. Frustrated officers in 2009 sent a letter to the Village Board complaining that the former police chief ignored Glienewicz's numerous sexual harassment complaints and intoxication. Read the full complaints here and here. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A police officer named Charles and his son, Donald, are being investigated by authorities for possibly having a fake marriage.

In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. (This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy - three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Advise on investing in equities (Money Magazine) -- Question: I'm a recent college grad with a steady job. Now that I've saved some money I want to invest. I've opened an online brokerage account, but the problem is I have no idea how to pick a stock. Where do I start? -- Celia, New York, N.Y. Answer: There's actually a very simple solution for anyone who wants to invest in equities, but doesn't have the foggiest idea of how to pick even a single stock. Don't buy one stock. Buy a few thousand. Yes, I realize that on the face of it, that may seem absurd. If you're that unsure of your stock-picking prowess, wouldn't buying hundreds or even thousands of stocks be much dicier than trying to settle on just one good one? The answer, paradoxically enough, is no. You're actually taking less risk by buying in bulk, provided you go about it the right way. When you invest in stocks, you are taking on several types of risk. Two of the most important are called systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk. Systematic risk is simply the risk of being in the stock market. Every stock's price fluctuates with the market overall, to one degree or another. To see the extent to which a stock will likely rise more steeply when the market soars or fall more sharply when it drops, you can check out a stat known as beta which you can find by plugging a stock's name or ticker symbol into the Get Quotes box at Yahoo! Finance and then clicking on the Key Statistics link under the Company heading on the quote summary page. The second risk is called idiosyncratic, or specific stock risk. This is the possibility that you'll incur a loss not just because the stock market declines, but that something goes wrong with the particular stock you've chosen. Maybe the new product that's supposed to boost earnings falls flat. Or perhaps an audit reveals that a top exec has been pilfering company funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. The important point, though, is that while you can't get away from systematic risk -- any stock you own will always be tied to the fortunes of the market overall -- you can sidestep much of the idiosyncratic or specific stock risk. How? By diversifying. If you plow all your money into just one stock and the company suits make a series of blunders that sends the firm into bankruptcy, your entire investment stake is in jeopardy. But if you spread your money among many stocks, you dramatically reduce the chances of taking a big hit due to idiosyncratic risk. After all, if you own, say, a couple hundred or more stocks, what are the chances that the management teams of all of them will screw up? In short, when it comes to buying stocks, there is at least some protection in numbers. So how do you get that protection as well as a shot at the long-term investment growth stocks can provide? Well, I say the easiest and most effective way is to invest in a total stock market index fund. When you buy this type of fund, you are effectively getting the entire U.S. stock market in a single fund. That means large, medium and small companies in all industries and sectors of the market the whole enchilada. What's more, you can get all this at a relative bargain price. The annual operating expenses on such funds are typically less than 0.20% of your account value each year, and can even run as low as 0.07%. That's 7 to 20 a year on a 10,000 investment. You can find a total stock market index fund in our MONEY 70 list of recommended funds, although other versions of this type of fund are also available through most large investment firms. You can also buy a total stock market fund as an ETF, or exchange traded fund. Until recently, a downside to ETFs was that brokerage commissions could erode the low annual expense advantage if you're investing small amounts. But a number of firms, including Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard and TD Waterhouse now offer ETFs without the brokerage commissions (although you should still see if there are other fees or account minimums). Before you boot up your computer to invest in a total stock market fund or ETF, however, I have two caveats. First, when you start scouting around the index and ETF world, you'll quickly find that investment firms also tout a mind-numbing array of variations on the total stock market theme, splicing and dicing the market into hundreds of indexes and ETFs focused on sectors, subsectors, market niches and, in my opinion, just plain gimmicky products. As I've noted before, I think investors are better off ignoring such gewgaws, as well as the explicit or implicit idea that you can boost returns by deftly timing your moves in and out of ETFs focusing on particular sectors. Focus instead on investing for the long-term in a broad portfolio such as a total stock index fund. Second, since buying a total stock index fund still leaves you vulnerable to systematic or market risk, I suggest you mitigate that threat a bit by putting some of your investment stash into another asset class -- bonds. You can take the same approach as with stocks by buying a total bond market index fund or ETF. (For guidance on how much to devote to bonds, click here and here. If you still want to try your hand at buying individual stocks, fine. You can learn more about how to do that by checking out our MONEY 101 lesson on investing in stocks and by going to the Stock Investing Courses link under the Learn heading in the Stocks section of Morningstar.com. But I suggest you wait until you've already established a core portfolio using the approach I've suggested here, and then go slow with modest amounts of money. Otherwise, learning about the stock market could be one of the most expensive educations you'll ever get.","completion":"A recent college graduate with a steady job wants to start investing in equities but is unsure of how to pick stocks. The recommended approach is to invest in a total stock market index fund, which provides exposure to a large number of stocks, reducing idiosyncratic risk and offering long-term growth potential. By diversifying investments, the investor can minimize the impact of individual stock failures. The inexpensive option of total stock market index funds allows for broad market exposure at a low cost. However, because investing in such funds still involves systematic risk, the investor should also consider putting some of their savings into bonds by investing in a total bond market index fund or ETF. This creates a balanced investment portfolio and reduces the risk associated with stock market fluctuations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I thought most of my customers would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn't have worried. After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger, and within a month my regular trucker customers had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot.

He was like a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties. Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table.

It follows the history of flight , from the first hot air balloons in the 19th century to 20th century manned space missions . It was created for performance at the National Air and Space Museum 's IMAX Theater in Washington , D.C. - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - The National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, also called the NASM, is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It holds the largest collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft in the world. It was established in 1946 as the National Air Museum and opened its main building on the National Mall near L'Enfant Plaza in 1976. In 2014, the museum saw approximately 6.7 million visitors, making it the fifth most visited museum in the world. The museum contains the Apollo 11 module, the Friendship 7 which was flown by John Glenn, the Bell X-1 which broke the sound barrier, and the Wright brothers plane near the entrance. - The National Mall is a national park in downtown Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Mall, which is part of its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit. The term \\"National Mall\\" commonly includes areas that are officially part of West Potomac Park and Constitution Gardens to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument dividing the area slightly west of its midpoint. A smaller designation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Mall proper\\", excludes both the Capitol grounds and the Washington Monument grounds, applying only to an area between them. The National Mall contains a number of museums and memorials and receives approximately 24 million visitors each year. - The Bell X-1 was a rocket engine-powered aircraft, designated originally as the XS-1, and was a joint National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics-U.S. Army Air Forces-U.S. Air Force supersonic research project built by Bell Aircraft. Conceived during 1944 and designed and built in 1945, it achieved a speed of nearly in 1948. A derivative of this same design, the Bell X-1A, having greater fuel capacity and hence longer rocket burning time, exceeded in 1954. The X-1, piloted by Chuck Yeager, was the first manned airplane to exceed the speed of sound in level flight and was the first of the X-planes, a series of American experimental rocket planes (and non-rocket planes) designated for testing of new technologies and often kept secret. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans, who were Americans, on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module \\"Eagle\\" on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module \\"Columbia\\" alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with \\"Columbia\\" in lunar orbit. - L'Enfant Plaza is a complex of four commercial buildings grouped around a large plaza in the Southwest section of Washington, D.C.. Immediately below the plaza and the buildings is the \\"La Promenade\\" shopping mall. The plaza is located south of Independence Avenue SW between 12th and 9th Streets SW (9th Street actually runs underneath the centers of the buildings on the easternmost side of the plaza). It was built perpendicular to L'Enfant Promenade, a north-south running street and pedestrian esplanade part of which is directly above 10th Street SW. The plaza is named for Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, the architect and planner who first designed a street layout for the capital city. It was dedicated in 1968 after completion of the north and south buildings. - Roman Kroitor (December 12, 1926 September 17, 2012) was a Canadian filmmaker who was known as an early practitioner of Cinéma vérité, as co-founder of IMAX, and as creator of the Sandde hand-drawn stereoscopic animation system. He was also the original inspiration for the Force, popularized in the \\"Star Wars\\" series. - The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871 January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867 May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who are generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful airplane. They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 190405 the brothers developed their flying machine into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft. Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. - IMAX (an acronym for Image maximum) is a motion picture film format and a set of cinema projection standards developed in Canada by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw. IMAX has the capacity to record and display images of far greater size and resolution than conventional film systems. Since 2002, some feature films have been converted (or upgraded) into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres and some have also been partially shot in IMAX. - The Smithsonian Institution, established in 1846 \\"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge,\\" is a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. Originally organized as the \\"United States National Museum,\\" that name ceased to exist as an administrative entity in 1967. Termed \\"the nation's attic\\" for its eclectic holdings of 138 million items, the Institution's nineteen museums, nine research centers, and zoo include historical and architectural landmarks, mostly located in the District of Columbia. Additional facilities are located in Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York City, Virginia, Texas, and Panama. More than 200 institutions and museums in 45 states, Puerto Rico, and Panama are Smithsonian Affiliates The Institution's thirty million annual visitors are admitted without charge. The institution's annual budget is around 1.2 billion with 2/3 coming from annual federal appropriations. Other funding comes from the Institution's endowment, private and corporate contributions, membership dues, and earned retail, concession, and licensing revenue.

Such films were originally shot on film stockthe only medium availablebut now include video and digital productions that can be either direct-to-video, made into a TV show, or released for screening in cinemas. \\"Documentary\\" has been described as a \\"filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception\\" that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries. - Direct-to-video or straight-to-video (also known as direct-to-VHS, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-Blu-ray, direct-to-digital, etc.) refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast. Because inferior sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies. - A film format is a technical definition of a set of standard characteristics regarding image capture on photographic film, for either stills or filmmaking. It can also apply to projected film, either slides or movies. The primary characteristic of a film format is its size and shape. - Ivan Graeme Ferguson, CM (born 7 October 1929 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian filmmaker and inventor who co-invented IMAX.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Meet the Oregon Journalist Who Keeps Taking Down Governors The resignation of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber on Friday is another pelt on the wall for Nigel Jaquiss, a Goldman Sachs oil trader turned muck-raking journalist. Jaquiss, 52, works at Willamette Week, the free alternative weekly in Portland where he reported on allegations of Gov. John Kitzhaber's influence peddling. From that modest perch, Jaquiss also won a Pulitzer Prize, in 2005, for exposing long-hidden sexual assault by former Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, the godfather of Oregon politics. And in 2009, Jaquiss's reporting revealed an improper sexual relationship between then-Portland Mayor Sam Adams and a legislative intern, which Adams initially denied. \\"It's pretty astonishing,\\" Jaquiss wrote in an e-mail. \\"Goldschmidt was no longer in office. Adams stayed in office. So from that perspective, this story had more impact than the other two.\\" “He never loses sight of where he's going.” Tim Gleason, University of Oregon Jaquiss leveled his sites on Kitzhaber, 67, late last year, and in October reported that the governor’s fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, 47, used taxpayer money to advance her green-energy consulting business. Jaquiss has followed the story with a bundle of scoops, feeding the flames that finally consumed Kitzhaber. In Kitzhaber's resignation statement, he acknowledged an \\"escalating media frenzy\\" stemming from the Hayes allegations. Kate Brown, Oregon's Secretary of State, will succeed Kitzhaber. \\"I think Nigel is among the best investigative journalists in the country,\\" says Tim Gleason, the former dean and a professor of journalism at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. \\"What distinguishes Nigel is his ability to focus. He never loses sight of where he's going. He just digs and digs and digs.\\" Jaquiss is a lanky, wonky journalist with none of the pretension of a Goldman trader or governor-slayer. After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1984, he traded oil derivatives for 11 years in New York and Singapore for Cargill, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman. Then he abruptly switched careers and went to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, graduating in 1997. He joined Willamette Week in 1998. He lives in Portland with his wife and three kids, and over lunch often shakes his head at the tawdry affairs in Oregon politics. He regularly beats the Oregonian, the state’s largest newspaper, on political scoops. Jaquiss earned his Pulitzer for breaking a story in May 2004 that revealed a long-rumored relationship in the 1970s between Goldschmidt and his family’s baby sitter, who was 14 at the time. The statute of limitations had expired so Goldschmidt—who was once secretary of transportation for Jimmy Carter—wasn't prosecuted. But Goldschmidt, who had been leading a bid by buyout firm TPG for Portland General Electric and also sitting on the State Board of Higher Education, resigned all his posts. He's since vanished from Oregon politics. Gleason also credits Jaquiss's managing editor, Brent Walth, for the publication's focus on public affairs. \\"Willamette Week has an interesting niche in this state,\\" says Gleason. \\"Others have pulled back more than a little from investigative journalism, but Willamette Week has remained a constant.\\" Before Jaquiss took aim at Kitzhaber directly, he helped kill one of the governor’s pet projects: the Columbia River Crossing, a new bridge across the Columbia River north of Portland. Jaquiss’s reporting showed that estimates for traffic over the bridge were too high and wouldn’t support the mammoth project unless proposed tolls on the span increased. You won't hear much about the Columbia River Crossing or Goldschmidt around Oregon these days. And now that Jaquiss is hanging Kitzhaber's pelt, you probably won't be hearing much from the former governor, either. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article highlights the impactful investigative journalism career of Nigel Jaquiss, an Oregon-based reporter who has garnered a reputation for taking down prominent political figures in the state. The article covers three key instances of his work: 1. In 2005, Jaquiss won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing former Governor Neil Goldschmidt's long-hidden sexual assault. Jaquiss's reporting led to Goldschmidt's resignation from all his posts and his subsequent disappearance from Oregon politics. 2. In 2009, Jaquiss revealed an improper sexual relationship between then-Portland Mayor Sam Adams and a legislative intern. Though Adams initially denied the allegations, his reputation was significantly tarnished by the reporting. 3. The most recent incident involves the resignation of Governor John Kitzhaber, which can be attributed to Jaquiss's dogged pursuit of allegations concerning influence peddling and the misuse of taxpayer money by the governor's fiancée, Cylvia Hayes. The article also demonstrates the importance of Jaquiss's work as an investigative journalist in keeping a check on those in power in Oregon, as well as highlighting the support of his managing editor, Brent Walth, and the significant role played by the publication Willamette Week in maintaining a focus on public affairs and investigative journalism in the state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras. - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear. - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States. - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus . - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population. - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen. - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara. - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section). - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area. - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\". - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations. - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus. - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

The White House accidentally revealed the name of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan to some 6,000 journalists. The person was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, \\"Chief of Station.\\" The print pool reporter -- a journalist allowed access to or is given information about an event who relays it to the rest of the media -- copied and pasted the list that was provided by the White House. Print pool reports are then distributed by the White House press office, which does not edit them, to a large list of media. In this case, the same reporter, Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post, noticed the unusual entry after the list was distributed and then checked it out with officials. The White House followed up and distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name. In his account to CNN, Wilson said when they arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President. A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, \\"manifest for briefing for Pool,\\" Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson and he proceeded to copy and paste that list for the pool report. He then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list. After the initial report had been issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list, which he flagged to the White House official. After checking with the military, the White House official said, \\"This is a problem.\\" The official asked if Wilson would write another pool report, asking journalists to disregard the previous report that contained the list with the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report. He said he was unsure whether that report was distributed. The new list, Wilson said, was distributed by a separate pool report that included details from Obama's speech to the troops. That report included a shorter list of names with a note saying, \\"this is the correct list of participants.\\" Privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident, but so far the White House and CIA officials have declined to comment publicly. A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. In the most recent case before this one, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003.

Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss.

The Seychelles , as with the other nations whose very existence is threatened by climate change , is small .","completion":"The debate topic that these sentences pertain to is the potential relocation of the Seychelles due to the threat of climate change. As a low-lying island nation, the Seychelles is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Consequently, the idea of relocating the entire country to protect its people, culture, and infrastructure has emerged as a topic of debate. The sentences provided give an overview of the key points regarding land availability and size comparisons for this potential relocation. 1. The first sentence emphasizes the size disparity between Kenya, one of the possible relocation options, and the Seychelles. Kenya's land area is more than 1200 times larger than that of the Seychelles, establishing that there is a vast difference in size between the two countries. 2. The second sentence lists other neighboring states (Tanzania, Somalia, and Madagascar) that could potentially provide land for the Seychelles' relocation. It suggests that these countries have ample land that they could offer without causing significant inconvenience to their own citizens. 3. The third sentence highlights the overall feasibility of finding enough land for the relocation due to the availability of land in neighboring states, thus making it a plausible option for the Seychelles to consider. 4. The fourth sentence provides a size comparison with a known city, indicating that the land area of the Seychelles is actually smaller than Washington D.C., further emphasizing the challenges that the nation faces in terms of space and vulnerability to climate change. 5. The fifth sentence highlights that the Seychelles is one of many nations whose existence is threatened by climate change, and that its small size amplifies this threat. This implies that addressing the issue of relocation might not only be vital for the Seychelles but for other similarly affected nations as well. In conclusion, the debate topic in question revolves around the potential relocation of the Seychelles due to the threats posed by climate change - with a focus on land availability, size comparisons, and the broader implications for other vulnerable nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The jury was deadlocked and could not reach a verdict. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Pick your answer from: 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","completion":"3). no Given that these two sentences contradict each other, we can confidently say that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true. Sentence 1 states that the jury has reached a verdict and found Moore guilty of several charges. Hence, they aren't \\"deadlocked\\" or unable to reach a verdict, as suggested by Sentence 2. In legal terms, a jury being \\"deadlocked\\" or a \\"hung jury\\" means that the jurors cannot agree upon a verdict unanimously after all reasonable efforts have been made to reach one. Consequently, no official verdict is given, and the case may need to be tried again. This is distinctly different from the scenario described in Sentence 1, where it's said that a verdict has indeed been reached where Moore is judged as guilty. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true (indicating that a verdict has been rendered), then Sentence 2, suggesting that the jury was deadlocked and could not reach a verdict, must be false. Therefore the answer is \\"3). no\\". It is impossible for the jury to have both reached a guilty verdict and failed to reach a verdict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 for j.","completion":"To solve this equation for j, you first need to simplify the equation by gathering the j terms together. The equation given is: 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 You need to carry out the subtraction operation on the left side. 79*j - 74*j gives you 5*j. Hence, the equation becomes: 5*j + 15 = 0 The next step is to isolate j. To accomplish this, you need to get rid of that '+15' on the left side. You can do this by performing the opposite mathematical operation. The opposite of '+15' is '-15'. So, you subtract 15 from both sides: 5*j = -15 Following, to completely isolate j, you need to get rid of the '5*' by dividing both sides by 5 because the opposite of multiplication is division. When you divide -15 by 5, the equation becomes: j = -15 / 5 Finally, solving the equation yields: j = -3 So, the solution to the equation 79*j - 74*j + 15 = 0 is j = -3."},{"prompt":"This article: The story takes place entirely in New York.

Please answer the following question: This article: Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days. Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations. At 12:36 p.m. on March 27, phreatic eruptions (explosions of steam caused by magma suddenly heating groundwater) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a new crater 250 feet (75 m) wide, and sending an ash column about 7,000 feet (2.1 km) into the air. By this date a 16,000-foot-long (3.0 mi; 4.9 km) eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3,000 to 3,400 m) above their vent. Most of this ash fell between three and twelve miles (5 and 19 km) from its vent, but some was carried 150 miles (240 km) south to Bend, Oregon, or 285 miles (460 km) east to Spokane, Washington. contains an answer for the question: By what specific date had a 16,000-foot-long eastward-trending fracture system developed across the summit area?, what is it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Thomas are brothers whose careers have taken them to different cities. Michael lives in Beijing, where the levels of air pollution are fairly high due to the extensive manufacturing industry. Thomas, on the other hand, lives in Seattle, which has low levels of air pollution thanks to government initiatives and culture attitudes in the region. Answer this question please: Who has a higher risk of developing lung cancer? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Michael, who lives in Beijing, has a higher risk of developing lung cancer due to the high levels of air pollution in the city. Air pollution is known to have various adverse effects on human health, with one of the primary concerns being its impact on respiratory health, including an increased risk of lung cancer. Beijing, known for its extensive manufacturing industry, has consistently faced issues with air pollution. The high levels of pollutants released from these industries, as well as from vehicular emissions and various other sources, contribute to poor air quality in the city. Breathing in polluted air exposes the residents to harmful chemicals and particulate matter that can damage lung tissue and create inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of developing lung diseases, including lung cancer. In contrast, Thomas lives in Seattle, which enjoys lower levels of air pollution due to the proactive government initiatives and the population's culture attitudes towards environmental conservation. The cleaner air in Seattle reduces the exposure to harmful pollutants and lowers the risk of various health problems, such as respiratory diseases and lung cancer. As a result, Thomas is at a significantly lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared to his brother Michael. Furthermore, it is important to note that children are even more susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution, as their lungs are still developing and growing. They also breathe in more air for their size compared to adults. While both Michael and Thomas are adults, this information is particularly relevant if they have children, as the air quality in their respective cities could have a significant impact on their children's health. In conclusion, Michael, living in Beijing with its high levels of air pollution, has a higher risk of developing lung cancer than his brother Thomas, who lives in the relatively cleaner air of Seattle. Despite the many factors that can influence an individual's risk of developing lung cancer, such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and overall health, the difference in air quality between the two cities plays a crucial role in determining their respective risks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Their unique musical style led to the rhythm and blues and rock and roll musical genres, and the subgenre doo-wop. The Ink Spots were widely accepted in both the white and black communities, largely due to the ballad style introduced to the group by lead singer Bill Kenny. In 1989, the Ink Spots (Bill Kenny, Deek Watson, Charlie Fuqua and Hoppy Jones) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 1999 they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 1936, Jerry Daniels was replaced by a 21-year-old singer from Baltimore, Bill Kenny, who signed on with the Ink Spots after winning first place in an amateur contest at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. Three years later, Kenny was credited for bringing the group to global success with his unusual high tenor ballad singing. In 1938, after being in the group for two years, Bill Kenny started to introduce the group to a new format that he called \\"Top & Bottom\\". This format was used primarily for ballads rather than the uptempo \\"jive\\" songs the group was used to performing. This format called for the tenor (Bill Kenny or Deek Watson) to sing the lead for one chorus followed by a chorus performed by bass singer Hoppy Jones reciting the lyrics rather than singing them. After a chorus of the \\"talking bass\\" the lead tenor sang the rest of the song until the end. The earliest example of their \\"Top & Bottom\\" format is from a radio broadcast from 1938. The song entitled \\"Tune In on My Heart\\" features Bill Kenny taking the lead and Hoppy Jones performing the talking bass. The year 1938 also saw Bill Kenny taking his first feature solo in Decca studios. His feature was on a song entitled \\"I Wish You the Best of Everything\\". Although it wasn't in the \\"Top & Bottom\\" format it was a ballad and used the signature Ink Spots guitar intro. Even though it got a good response, it wasn't very successful in terms of record sales and didn't reach the pop charts.

Movie title: Charlotte's Web Context: With the birth of a new litter of 11 piglets, the farmer must eliminate one so the mother can feed them. The farmer gets his ax and selects the runt of the litter when he is stopped by his daughter, Fern (Dakota Fanning). Fern begins to feed her new piglet and names him Wilbur (voice of Dominic Scott Kay). After Wilbur gets strong enough to be on his own, he is put into the barn across the road. In the new barn, he meets many different animals: cows, sheep, geese, a rat, a horse, and of course a spider named Charlotte (voice of Julia Roberts). Wilbur's friendship with all the animals in the barn brings them all together, and they become one big happy family. There is only one problem that Wilbur doesn't know, he is a spring pig, and they don't usually get to see winter. Charlotte promises Wilbur that she will do something to save his life. Charlotte spins the words \\"some pig\\" in her web to show the farmer a miracle that may save Wilbur's life. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) The answer is:","completion":"In the movie \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" the farmer must eliminate one piglet because a litter of 11 piglets is too many for the mother to adequately feed and care for. By reducing the litter size, the mother pig can provide more attention and resources to the remaining piglets, increasing their chances of survival and growth.

Answer the following question: I heard that Remy hadn't seen the shore in ages. She was so happy to be back in the sun. And I was wondering Why did Remy do this? Answer:","completion":"Without additional context, it's hard to provide a precise answer to why Remy hadn't seen the shore in ages and why she was happy to be back in the sun. However, one can make a few general assumptions given the information provided. Firstly, Remy could possibly have been living in a place where there is no beach or shore nearby, thereby limiting her opportunity to see the shore. This could be a landlocked area or a city lifestyle which kept her busy away from nature. Regarding her happiness, it is regular human psychology that change brings happiness in most of the scenarios. Similarly, spending time outside, especially in sunny, natural environments, has been scientifically shown to significantly boost mood and mental health. Therefore, after an extended period away from the shore and sun, Remy would likely experience an increase in happiness upon returning. Further, the sun is also an excellent source of Vitamin D, which promotes healthy skin and bones, increases energy, and boosts the immune system. It is also said to help alleviate some of the symptoms of depression. This could be another reason why Remy was happy to be back in the sun after a long time. So, with all these possible assumptions, I can say that Remy's return to the shore and happiness stems from a mix of preference, exposure to nature, the physical benefits of sunlight, and the overall mental upliftment provided by a change in scenery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Marie Charlotte Carmichael Stopes (15 October 1880 - 2 October 1958) was a British author, palaeobotanist and campaigner for eugenics and women's rights. She made significant contributions to plant palaeontology and coal classification, and was the first female academic on the faculty of the University of Manchester. With her second husband, Humphrey Verdon Roe, Stopes founded the first birth control clinic in Britain. Stopes edited the newsletter Birth Control News, which gave explicit practical advice. Around the start of her divorce proceedings in 1913, Stopes began to write a book about the way she thought marriage should work. In July 1913, she met Margaret Sanger, who had just given a talk on birth control at a Fabian Society meeting. Stopes showed Sanger her writings and sought her advice about a chapter on contraception. Stopes' book was finished by the end of 1913. She offered it to Blackie and Son, who declined. Several publishers refused the book because they thought it too controversial. When Binnie Dunlop, secretary of the Malthusian League, introduced her to Humphrey Verdon Roe--Stopes' future second husband--in 1917, she received the boost that helped her publish her book. Roe was a philanthropist interested in birth control; he paid Fifield & Co. to publish the work. The book was an instant success, requiring five editions in the first year, and elevated Stopes to national prominence. Married Love was published on 26 March 1918; that day, Stopes was visiting Humphrey Roe, who had just returned with a broken ankle from service during the First World War after his aeroplane crashed. Less than two months later they were married and Stopes had her first opportunity to practise what she preached in her book. The success of Married Love encouraged Stopes to provide a follow-up; the already written Wise Parenthood: a Book for Married People, a manual on birth control that was published later that year. Many readers wrote to Stopes for personal advice, which she energetically endeavoured to give. The following year, Stopes published A Letter to Working Mothers on how to have healthy children and avoid weakening pregnancies, a condensed version of Wise Parenthood aimed at the poor. It was a 16-page pamphlet and was to be distributed free of charge. Stopes's intended audience had--until this work--been the middle classes. She had shown little interest in, or respect for, the working classes; the Letter was aimed at redressing her bias. On 16 July 1919, Stopes--pregnant and a month overdue--entered a nursing home. Stopes and the doctors clashed over the method of birth--she was not allowed to give birth on her knees. The child was stillborn; the doctors suggested the incident was due to syphilis, but an examination excluded the possibility. Stopes was furious and said her baby had been murdered. She was 38 years old. What is married love?","completion":"Married Love is a book written by Marie Stopes, which talks about the way she thought marriage should work. It shares ideas about relationships between married people and how to have a happy marriage.

To get up early in the morning for exercise, try these steps: 1. Sleep time: Go to bed earlier, like when mommy and daddy say it's bedtime. This helps you get enough sleep so you won't be grumpy. 2. Set an alarm: Choose a fun song or sound to gently wake you up. It's like your superhero wake-up call. 3.

Now, waking up early in the morning for studying is similar, but let's think of it like preparing for a quiz show: 1. Sleep time: Go to bed early so your brain can rest and be sharp for learning. 2. Set an alarm: Choose a happy and calm sound to wake up peacefully, ready to study. 3. Get excited: Imagine you are going on a treasure hunt to find facts and learn new things. 4. Make a plan: With your parents, set a schedule for the morning that includes fun study time. Although both questions ask about waking up early, one is for exercise and one is for studying.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Would you rather just wear trousers? Valentino makes them cool again. One in a series on the clothes that made a splash at Paris Fashion Week. PARIS — In the amicable fashion divorce that saw former Valentino co-designer Maria Grazia Chiuri moving to Dior and her partner Pierpaolo Piccioli staying put, one could argue that Piccioli got custody of the daywear. And it looked terrific. Valentino is not particularly known as the go-to for women who need a good jacket for a business-day ensemble or who are eager for trousers because they can’t stand the thought of another sleeveless sheath. But the collection that Piccioli put on the runway in the elegant Hôtel Salomon de Rothschild blended the luxury and extravagance of Valentino with a real world sensibility: more relaxed, a little sharper and more firmly rooted in the day-to-day of shoulder-bumping sidewalks, frantic commutes and other messiness. To be clear, Piccioli wasn’t putting blue jeans and cargo pants on the runway. His clothes were wholly in the vernacular of the house: lush fabrics, romantic colors, high prices. But he managed to combine the art of Hieronymus Bosch with the prints of Zandra Rhodes and wrap it all up in a subtext of punk — and a palette of pink. And somehow, inexplicably, it all worked. Instead of coming across as an idealized version of a woman as an indulged princess, the clothes were more willing to engage with her as a woman who sometimes just wants to throw on an old Army jacket, a crisp white shirt or a canvas coat — Valentino style — and go. A dress is easy and pretty and feminine. And there were plenty of those on the Valentino runway. But there is something about a pair of trousers that speaks of a no-nonsense approach to life, of practicality and, well, jauntiness. Which is a very upmarket way of expressing that elusive notion: cool. ALSO AT PARIS FASHION WEEK: The power of being invisible — in oversized clothes by Comme des Garcons How ‘street style’ lost its meaning and its power From fencing jackets to tulle skirts, Dior sees many ways to dress a feminist These delicate, swirling clothes from Rick Owens are a blast of pure emotion No, really: A big white shirt is all you’ll want next spring, if fashion has its way Rihanna actually took fashion to a new place.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Rams, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel against the Miami Dolphins &#8212; the Broncos' first home game in exactly one month. The Dolphins grabbed the early lead, with running back Daniel Thomas rushing for a 3-yard touchdown. The Broncos subsequently got on the scoreboard, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Dolphins added to their lead early in the second quarter, with quarterback Ryan Tannehill rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. The Broncos cut into the Dolphins' lead, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, however, the Dolphins responded, with Tannehill throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace. Another touchdown pass from Manning to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 14 yards out &#8212; narrowed the Dolphins' lead to 21-17 just before halftime. The Broncos drove to as far as the Dolphins' 7-yard line on the initial possession of the second half, but after Manning was sacked by Dolphins' linebacker Jelani Jenkins for an 8-yard loss, McManus missed on a 33-yard field goal attempt. After the Broncos' defense forced a Dolphins' punt, return specialist Isaiah Burse fumbled deep in Broncos' territory, giving the football back to the Dolphins. Four plays later, Tannehill connected with wide receiver Jarvis Landry on a 5-yard touchdown pass to give the Dolphins a 28-17 lead at the 2:15 mark of the third quarter. The Broncos then reeled off 22 unanswered points. Early in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his third touchdown pass of the game to Demaryius Thomas &#8212; from 5 yards out &#8212; coupled with a two-point conversion pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. After forcing a Dolphins' punt, the Broncos grabbed their first lead of the game at the 5:05 mark of the fourth quarter, with running back C. J. Anderson rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. On the third play of the Dolphins' next possession, Tannehill was intercepted by Broncos' safety T. J. Ward, who advanced the football all the way to the Dolphins' 8-yard line. Two plays later, Manning threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker to increase the Broncos' lead to 39-28 with 3:17 remaining in the fourth quarter.

Bu tür protesto yürüyüşleri, politik kararlara duyulan anlaşmazlık ve memnuniyetsizliği ifade etmek için organize edilir ve genellikle kalabalık gruplar şeklinde gerçekleşir. Yürüyüşler sırasında, protestocuların genellikle sloganlar attığı veya pankartlar taşıdığı görülmektedir. Bu özel durumda, üyelerin protestolarda, aldıkları karara ilişkin hoşnutsuzluklarını dile getirerek Oprea ve partinin diğer yetkililerine tepkilerini iletmeyi amaçladıkları düşünülmekte. Bu tür çatışmalar ve protestolar, demokratik süreçlerin işleyişine katkıda bulunarak politik liderler ve halk arasında daha açık bir iletişimsel yapı kurmaya yardımcı olabilir ve politik süreçleri şekillendirmede vatandaş katılımına önemli bir yer sağlar. Sonuç olarak, bu durum Türkiye'deki siyasi arenaya özgü değil; dünya genelinde demokratik süreçlerin bir parçası olarak düşünülmelidir.

The Unisphere is located in the borough of Queens in New York City. Specifically, it can be found in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which is one of the largest parks in the city. Constructed for the 1964-1965 World's Fair, the Unisphere is an iconic, stainless steel representation of the Earth, symbolizing the theme of the fair, \\"Peace through Understanding\\". Designed by landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke, the structure stands 140 feet tall and features three orbits, which signify the first successful man-made satellite (Sputnik) and the orbits of the first American astronaut (John Glenn) and the first Russian cosmonaut (Yuri Gagarin). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park not only houses the Unisphere but also serves as a hub for sports, recreation, and cultural events that take place throughout the year. Other attractions near the Unisphere include the Queens Museum, the New York Hall of Science, the Queens Botanical Garden, and the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which hosts the annual US Open Tennis Championships. On the other hand, the statement provided refers to the New York Wheel project, which was a proposed Ferris wheel that was initially planned for Staten Island, but was later canceled in October 2018 due to financial and legal complexities. The purpose of the New York Wheel project was to create a major tourist attraction and public space on the northern shore of Staten Island that would provide spectacular views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty, and Lower Manhattan. Despite generating initial enthusiasm and interest, the ambitious project did not go through, and as a result, construction was ceased."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: – New York magazine is out with a lengthy profile of former presidential aide Hope Hicks that provides some behind-the-scenes snapshots of her stint in the White House and her close, daughterly relationship with President Trump. (He would regularly summon her to his office by shouting, \\"Hopester!\\" or \\"Hopey!\\") Just maybe don't expect it to reveal too much, with the article leaving Ruth Graham at Slate wondering, \\"How is it possible to read 6,000 words of deep reporting on Hope Hicks and still not really understand her at all?\\" The question, though, meshes with the gist of the profile, which emphasizes that the 29-year-old Hicks was that rarity in DC: someone who shunned publicity (though also someone who cares about her public image). The story by Olivia Nuzzi recounts that Hicks considered resigning twice before eventually making the move on Feb. 28. \\"She'd prayed a lot over the weekend,\\" then opened a notebook in her White House office that morning with pro and con lists about resigning—not if, but when, writes Nuzzi. At noon, she informed Trump she was out immediately, tired not of him but of the toxic DC environment. \\"Before she could finish resigning, Trump interrupted her,\\" writes Nuzzi. \\"He told her that he cared about her happiness, that he understood her decision, and he would help her do anything she wanted to do in her life. He said he hoped she would go make a lot of money.

Article:","completion":"The Unraveling Enigma of Hope Hicks: A Rare, Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse New York magazine recently published an extensive profile on Hope Hicks, the former White House Communications Director and presidential aide. The article provides some rare behind-the-scenes glimpses into her life during her tenure at the White House and her close, daughterly relationship with President Trump. Despite the in-depth examination, the piece leaves some readers, such as Ruth Graham at Slate, still puzzled by who Hope Hicks genuinely is. Hope Hicks, a 29-year-old political advisor, is a rare phenomenon in Washington DC - someone who shunned publicity but also cared deeply about her public image. Olivia Nuzzi, the author of this captivating profile in New York magazine, unfolds the layers of Hicks' life to uncover the events leading up to her decision to resign. The article reveals that Hicks considered resigning twice before finally leaving on February 28th. Ironically, the elusive nature of Hope Hicks is what meshes with the overall theme of the profile, which emphasizes her enigmatic persona and ability to keep her public image intact even amidst the tumultuous political environment. This apparent contradiction between her desire for privacy and her pursuit of a public career makes Hicks an intriguing subject for a profile. One of the most compelling aspects of the article is the portrayal of her close relationship with President Trump. Hicks became one of Trump's most trusted confidants during her time at the White House and, according to the profile, he would regularly summon her to his office by shouting, \\"Hopester!\\" or \\"Hopey!\\" The article delves into the chemistry between Hicks and Trump, highlighting his trust in her advice and her unwavering loyalty to him. This loyalty is also evident when the article discusses the moment Hicks decided to resign. Apparently, she had prayed a lot over the weekend and had even written a pros and cons list in a notebook about the timing of her resignation, not about whether to resign. At noon that day, she informed Trump of her decision to leave immediately due to her exhaustion from the toxic DC environment, rather than distancing herself from him. In response, Trump interrupted her and expressed his concern for her happiness, understanding her difficult decision, and pledging to help her in any way possible. He simultaneously expressed hopefulness that she would “go make a lot of money” and eventually return to the White House someday. As the profile comes to a close, it touches upon the high-profile personal relationships that Hicks had during her time at the White House, namely her connections to former Trump aides Rob Porter and Corey Lewandowski. These relationships garnered significant media attention, further fueling the enigmatic aura that surrounds Hope Hicks. While the article offers an in-depth look into Hope Hicks' life, striving to unravel the enigma, readers may still be left with questions about the true essence of who she is. The mystery surrounding Hicks can be seen as both frustrating and alluring, making her story even more captivating to follow. As she embarks on the next chapter of her life, one thing seems certain: Hope Hicks will continue to captivate and mystify those who try to understand her."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Review: This excellent series, narrated by Laurence Olivier, brilliantly, it should be said, charts the beginning to the end of World War 2. The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one reviewer says, that must be hard to do, in a 26-part series with so much to cram in. Apart from the expected combat photography/action, there are plenty of personal, emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a World War 2 buff/fan. Episodes showing 'testimonies' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies/adversary, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the U.S.A. were quite eye-opening. Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians, the death camps etc., were very well handled and exposed. I'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation (Of which it could be said I am one at 47!). Certain things are quite strangely left out, like the advent of the new jet era beginning, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the V2. This is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WW2 brought forward from a more barren old science. But a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated.

Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

In the autumn of 1988 almost all the 200,000 Azerbaijani minority in Armenia was expelled by Armenian Nationalists, with over 100 killed in the process – this, after the Sumgait pogrom earlier that year carried out by Azerbaijanis against ethnic Armenians and subsequent expulsion of all Armenians from Azerbaijan. On November 25, 1988, a military commandant took control of Yerevan as the Soviet government moved to prevent further ethnic violence.

Transistor In a switching circuit, the idea is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off, short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the \\"off\\" output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry; the resistance of the transistor in the \\"on\\" state is too small to affect circuitry; and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect. Q: What is a switching circuit trying to simulate when on?","completion":"When a switching circuit is on, it is trying to simulate an ideal short circuit.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person Stern compared to Marilyn? is inside the article: Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her \\"Spinning Around\\" video led to some media outlets referring to her as \\"SexKylie\\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a \\"double edged sword\\", observing that \\"we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.

Eden Hoelscher's mom, Kylee Hoelscher, reports in a GoFundMe page set up to help with that therapy that her daughter was walking at 9 months, potty-trained herself at 18 months, and rode a bike, sans training wheels, the first time she tried. \\"She just came out of the womb with so much energy,\\" Hoelscher tells ABC News. Doing flips and falling came with bumps and bruises, so after Eden did a simple gymnastics move she'd done dozens of times before—pushing herself off the ground in a backbend position—and complained that her legs and hip hurt, her mother hugged her and told her to calm down. A half-hour later Eden's face changed; she said she felt like her legs had fallen asleep and she was unable to move them. That was on Dec. 23; the 5-year-old would go on to spend the next 52 days in the hospital, where doctors discovered she had hyperextended her spine and caused the artery that feeds her spinal cord to stop pumping blood, causing a stroke in her spinal cord and paralyzing her from the waist down. \\"The extent of damage is unheard of,\\" her mother writes. \\"Her bowels and bladder do not work.

A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design. \\"wow\\" (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover. What happens if a vinyl comes with a bit of warp?","completion":"If a vinyl record comes with a bit of warp, it means that the record is not completely flat and has a slight curve or bend. This can happen for different reasons like heat, sunlight, or storage issues. When you play a warped record on a turntable, the sound quality might not be as good because the needle could have trouble following the grooves in the music. It might cause wobbly sounds, called \\"wow\\", which means the music pitch changes as the record spins.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Review: This film centers on four criminals, locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell, hoping that a mysterious book of black magic, penned by a former inmate around 1920, named Danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young. Carrère's(Gérald Laroche)criminal business tactics(shortcuts)have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates..a transsexual brute Marcus(Clovis Cornillac), Marcus' love-toy Pâquerette(Dimitri Rataud)who eats objects he touches(..and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister)and obeys his charge as if \\"he\\" were his mother, and the scholarly Lassalle(Philippe Laudenbach)who doesn't read, or eat breakfast(..the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day). The film follows Carrère as he reads from the book, attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison. Carrère loves his child, and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail. When she betrays him, Carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate, and longing to see and hold his beloved son. Carrère's toughest critic is Marcus, who longs to be fully female, while still folding to several masculine traits, such as working out and taking a leak standing up. He talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic, although deep inside is a world of vulnerability. Pâquerette is completely under Marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master..there's even an alarming scene where Pâquerette breast-feeds from Marcus! Lassalle is an unraveling mystery, opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain. Clearly intellectual, and holding possible secrets from the others, Lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going. Soon, those who aren't a threat to the book seek their \\"true\\" escape, not as much from the cell of four walls, but the cell that imprisons their true desires. After a certain murder, the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant..who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away, and better yet, how to use it? A constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach. I'm glad I had a chance to watch this film. It does play out like \\"Monkey's Paw\\", the characters get what they desire, but a price must be met. There's gore in the film, startling moments of graphic violence, but, in my opinion, this is first and foremost a story-driven tale. The gore is a product of what the book unleashes. One of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air, while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire. We see Danver's fate at the end, with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away. Lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence. I will say that Maléfique, through Eric Valette's well paced direction, always kept my attention, and, for being such an isolated movie(..about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location, the prison cell)it never seems to drag.

The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \\"Popish Plot\\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton.

James Haskell celebrated his return to the England fold with a typical all-action display in their 21-16 win over Wales, but he ended up red-faced after running into the post instead of diving over for a certain try. The Wasps skipper has been in and out of the England side for years now, but with injuries piling up in the back row he was given the nod and certainly put his hand up to become a mainstay with a powerful performance at the Millennium Stadium. But England were 16-15 down and putting Wales under intense pressure when Haskell ran straight into the post in a slapstick moment amid the fury of battle in the RBS 6 Nations opener. James Haskell (centre) was denied a try during England's 21-16 victory over Wales on Friday night. Haskell (with the blue scrum cap) is tackled by Wales' Toby Faletau into the post protector in Cardiff. Haskell (blue scrum cap) bounced back off the post protector at the Millennium Stadium on Friday. 'I knew I wasn't going to get there so I tried to hit and bounce back out and I bounced back into the post unbelievably, but only I could do that,' he told BBC Sport. In the end it did not matter as fly-half George Ford booted England clear with two late penalties and that was a remarkable turnaround after Wales raced into a 10-0 lead after eight minutes. With the Cardiff crowd still dazzled by a fireworks and lights show beforehand, Warren Gatland's men caught England cold as Rhys Webb scampered over and Leigh Halfpenny added the extras and a penalty. But England built on some mighty work by their forwards as Bath backs and Six Nations debutants Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph both claimed touchdowns. Ford added three penalties and a conversion - his second strike after Wales wing Alex Cuthbert had been sin-binned - while Wales failed to score in the second period after another Halfpenny penalty and a Dan Biggar drop-goal had given them what appeared to be a solid advantage. Faletau (right) pushes Haskell into the post as he is prevented from scoring a try for England. Haskell (centre) is tackled by Wales' Alex Cuthbert (left) as he advances with the ball for England. Haskell said afterwards that Stuart Lancaster's men always believed they were capable of turning things round, adding: 'We've done a lot of work, there's a lot of talent in this group, and I think we felt if we stick in the game, keep our discipline and play in the right areas then we were going to get tries.' Ford once again showcased his talents, remaining cool under pressure to boot over the decisive penalty after England had given themselves an 18-16 lead, and he was just glad to give his side their just rewards for a stellar evening's work. 'I just wanted to knock it over for the lads really. The performance they put in, especially the pack again, was outstanding so it was the least I could do to kick that,' he said. 'We felt comfortable first half. We obviously had a bit of a poor start but to come out and score 13 points, the message at half-time was exactly the same as the messages before the game.' Faletau (obscured) tackles Haskell during England's famous victory at the Millennium Stadium. Wales boss Gatland paid tribute to England's second-half show, despite clear frustrations over his side throwing away the 16-8 advantage they held at half-time. 'Give England credit, I thought they played particularly well in the second half,' he said. 'I thought we started the game well and played pretty well in the first half, were reasonably comfortable at half-time, but we weren't able to score points in the second half and that sometimes happens at top-level sport.' There was a question mark afterwards over George North being allowed to play the whole game, despite picking up several heavy knocks, and some were questioning if he was showing signs of concussion. Gatland belayed those fears and backed his medical team, adding: 'Well that's part of the medical protocol. The medical team wouldn't have let him back on the field unless they felt 100 per cent confident that he was okay, so you've got to back your medical team and I haven't spoken to them about it. George seems fine.' Haskell (second right) celebrates with England team-mate Billy Vunipola (left) at the final whistle.

Professor Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has won the £1m award for his development of drug-release systems, tissue building and microchip implants. The Queen Elizabeth Prize, designed to become a \\"Nobel\\" for engineering, was set up with cross-party backing and industry support to celebrate innovators with global impact. Prof Langer's work has been cited 170,000 times - making him the most cited engineer in history - and he has more than 1,000 patents granted or pending for his inventions. It is estimated that as many as two billion people have in some way been touched by technologies devised and developed by him and his teams. The previous winners of the prize - set up to inspire young people to become engineers - were the five pioneers of the Internet and World Wide Web including Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Prof Langer told the BBC: \\"I've always wanted to see what I can do to help people have happier, healthier lives. I worked in a hospital for a number of years - I've seen different medical problems and I've thought: What can we do to make things better for people?\\" He said he was delighted to win the award because he supported \\"the idea of inspiring young people - nothing is more important than that\\". In the 1970s, in the face of widespread opposition from the medical and scientific establishment, Prof Langer pioneered the use of materials known as polymers which could gradually release sophisticated medications. It had been thought that the large molecules involved in treatments for diseases such as cancer and diabetes could not pass through polymers, but Prof Langer found ways to achieve this, allowing the development of devices to release controlled amounts of drugs. Working with surgeons at Boston Children's Hospital, he developed the first substances that could block the spread of blood vessels in tumours - a process called angiogenesis. His aim was to target anti-cancer drugs where they were most needed, to avoid harm to the whole body. Among his first inventions were \\"wafers\\" containing medication that could be inserted at the right locations, including brain tumours. Prof Langer is known for bringing together researchers from many different disciplines ranging from chemical engineering - his original field - to patient care. His design for cardiovascular stents which are coated in drugs has gone on to benefit about 10 million heart patients. Combining materials science and medicine enabled him to make significant advances in tissue engineering - using synthetic polymers to guide cells into forming a wide range of tissues. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved this technique for making artificial skin for use on burn victims and people with diabetic skin ulcers. Trials of the growth of new cartilage and spinal cord repair are under way. More recently Prof Langer has developed implants designed to release specific doses of drugs over a period of years - with the potential for the releases to be controlled remotely by wireless signals. The first uses of these devices are planned to be for diabetes medication, female contraception and osteoporosis while the provision of malaria drugs and essential minerals are on the horizon too. On the opposition faced by many of his inventions, Prof Langer said: \\"Conventional wisdom is not always right and to really invent things, to come up with ideas, you to have examine carefully the basis for that conventional wisdom, and a lot of inventions have come because people say, 'What I've read, isn't right' - and that's part of what we did. \\"When I started doing a lot of this work in the 1970s, it probably was considered science fiction, in fact a lot of the people who reviewed our grants said we shouldn't get the funds because it was like fiction. \\"But you keep pushing, you keep believing in your ideas and eventually they do become reality.\\" When asked how he would spend the prize money, Prof Langer said he would leave it to his wife to decide. He will receive the award from the Queen later this year.

Write an article based on this summary: A 62-year-old man has been arrested after a man in his 30s was found seriously injured with stab wounds.","completion":"Title: Man in his 30s Found Seriously Injured with Stab Wounds, Assailant Arrested Introduction In an alarming incident, a 62-year-old man was taken into custody by local law enforcement after a man in his 30s was discovered with critical stab wounds. Given the sensitive nature of the case, names have been withheld at the request of the authorities as they continue with their investigation. Here is a step-by-step account of the events that transpired. Step 1: Discovering the Victim On the evening of the incident, a passerby came across the injured man lying on the ground in a pool of blood. The Good Samaritan immediately alerted the authorities, who arrived at the scene within minutes. The victim was taken to the nearest hospital where he is being treated for multiple life-threatening injuries. Step 2: Identification of Suspect and Victim The police cordoned off the area and began a thorough examination of the crime scene to gather critical details about the attacker. Meanwhile, the hospital was able to provide the police with identification for the victim. The victim's family was contacted, and an all-points bulletin was issued to apprehend the suspect based on the information provided. Step 3: Search for Assailant The police conducted an extensive search in the vicinity of the crime scene, and nearby CCTV footage was analyzed to provide a clearer picture of the attacker's appearance and movements. Useful information from eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen the suspect fleeing the scene was also obtained. Step 4: Apprehension of Suspect Through a combination of swift detective work and technological support, the authorities were able to zero in on and locate the 62-year-old suspect at his residence the very same night. The man was then taken into custody without any struggle. Step 5: Investigation and Charges Following his arrest, the suspect is currently being interrogated by the police to determine the motive behind the vicious attack. It remains unknown if the men were acquaintances or if the incident occurred as a result of an altercation. Charges are yet to be laid, as more information surrounding the circumstances of the stabbing comes to light. Conclusion This episode highlights the importance of quick thinking and prompt action by both the passerby and law enforcement agencies. The near-immediate apprehension of the suspect ensures public safety and can potentially prevent further violence in the community. While the victim still struggles for his life at the hospital, the authorities are working diligently to uncover more details and deliver justice to the individuals involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The battle was stopped before either side had achieved victory, and the two parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute. After the battle Amr ibn al-As was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator, and Ali appointed Abu Musa Ashaari. Seven months later, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at Adhruh, about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordon. Amr ibn al-As convinced Abu Musa Ashaari that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new Caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the Caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah I. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and Amr. Ali refused to accept the verdict and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Please answer this question : Who is causing more marine pollution? Answer:","completion":"In the given situation, Hilda is causing more marine pollution than Luke. This is primarily due to the fact that Hilda has been disposing of her excess fertilizer into the river connected to the Malegese Ocean for decades. The practice of dumping excess fertilizer into water bodies can have severe consequences on marine ecosystems, leading to hypoxia, dead zones, and the disruption of aquatic flora and fauna. When fertilizer chemicals are introduced into waterways, they contribute to the excessive growth of algae, which in turn depletes oxygen levels in the water, adversely affecting marine animals and potentially leading to their death. On the other hand, Luke is consciously managing his waste and excess fertilizer by storing it for future use or properly disposing of it rather than disposing of it into the rivers connected to the Dundrin Ocean. This demonstrates his awareness of the various environmental issues caused by improper waste disposal and his commitment to mitigating marine pollution. Consequently, Luke is causing far less marine pollution compared to Hilda. Although the Dundrin Ocean is connected to numerous rivers originating from uninhabited and natural areas of the world, which may contain agricultural runoff or other pollutants, the primary factor in determining who is responsible for causing more marine pollution in this specific situation lies in the practices implemented by the farm owners, Hilda and Luke. Since Hilda continues to dispose of her excess fertilizer into the river, she contributes significantly more to marine pollution than Luke, who upholds proper waste management practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he explains: They held a tryout for 5-year-old boys and my father took me there. I didn't even have real skates. I had those blades that you screwed onto the soles of your shoes, but I was tall, and the 9-year-olds didn't have a goalie, so they put me in with them and thats where I fell in love with the game of hockey. Context: Before the start of the next season, Hasek was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in an attempt to lower the Sabres' payroll and to send Hasek to a more competitive team. He was dealt for Vyacheslav Kozlov, a first round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft and future considerations, which eventually became the draft pick of Jim Slater. During his first season with Detroit, Hasek posted a career high 41 wins with just 15 losses, helping the Red Wings earn the President's Trophy with the league's best record. In the playoffs, he led the Wings past the Vancouver Canucks, the St. Louis Blues, the Colorado Avalanche and eventually the Carolina Hurricanes in the finals to win the Stanley Cup. During the conference finals against Colorado, he became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season after passing the puck to Wings captain Steve Yzerman, who then assisted Fredrik Olausson in scoring the final goal of the third game of that series. He also set a record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, broken the year after by Martin Brodeur with seven. That summer, Hasek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies. However, after Detroit's first round loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the following season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year 24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies. In the 2003-04 season Hasek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hasek privately told general manager Ken Holland that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about 3 million of his 6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in Prague, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate. Question: What else did you find interesting in this section?. Whats the answer?","completion":"There are several interesting aspects in this section related to Dominik Hasek's hockey career and personal decisions, which can be highlighted as follows: 1. Trade to Detroit Red Wings: Hasek's trade to the Red Wings not only aimed to lower the Sabres' payroll but also provided him a chance to play for a more competitive team. The transaction involved a notable exchange, including Vyacheslav Kozlov and future draft selections. 2. Impressive first season with Detroit: Hasek had an outstanding first season with the Red Wings, achieving a substantial 41-win record and contributing to the team winning the President's Trophy for the league's best record. 3. Record-setting performances: During the playoffs, Hasek set a record for most shutouts in a postseason (with six), which was only broken later by Martin Brodeur. He also became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the postseason, showcasing his versatility on the ice. 4. Initial retirement and then return: Hasek's decision to retire, followed by his sudden urge to resume playing, created a challenging situation for the Red Wings. Their roster now had three potential starting goalies, including the experienced Curtis Joseph, who had a sizable contract with a no-trade clause. 5. Groin injury and financial sacrifice: Hasek's decision to forego a significant portion of his salary while dealing with a groin injury showcased his character and commitment to the team. His decision to undergo surgery in Prague and recover in his hometown of Pardubice further illustrates his connection to his roots. These points demonstrate Dominik Hasek's impact on the teams he played for, his remarkable achievements on the ice, and his personal values and decisions that shaped his career."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jesse Donald Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (nee Moore). His parents were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors immigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph. Before he entered high school, Knotts began performing as a ventriloquist and comedian at various church and school functions. After high school, he traveled to New York City to try to make his way as a comedian, but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the United States Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops. He toured the Pacific Islands as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called Stars and Gripes. His ventriloquist act included a dummy named Danny \\"Hooch\\" Matador. In a TV Guide interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the South Pacific. He swore that he could hear the dummy calling for help as the ship sailed on, leaving him bobbing helplessly in the waves. Knotts served in the United States Army from June 21, 1943 to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with a Carbine BAR) and Honorable Service Lapel Pin. Knotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \\"Windy Wales\\" on a radio western called \\"Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders\\". Knotts got his first major break on television in the soap opera Search for Tomorrow where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on Steve Allen's variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \\"Man in the Street\\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959-1960 season. From October 20, 1955 through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway version of No Time for Sergeants, in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher. In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with Andy Griffith in the film version of No Time for Sergeants. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit. What did he say about this","completion":"Unfortunately, while we have quite a bit of information on the life and career of Jesse Donald Knotts, also known as Don Knotts, there are no specific statements from him about the particular events and experiences you've mentioned, at least none that have been highly publicized or documented. Even during interviews, Knotts seemed to have focused more on his work and the people he worked with rather than his personal journey in the early days. His style of storytelling and humor is often observed more in his work than his background or upbringing. However, his autobiography \\"Barney Fife And Other Characters I Have Known\\" could provide more depth and insight about his early life, his struggles, and journey in the entertainment industry. In interviews and his autobiography, Knotts did share his thoughts on his acting career and his unforgettable character Barney Fife from “The Andy Griffith Show”. He reportedly stated that he believed the character was so popular because he was everyone's deputy, recklessly brave while being absolutely terrified. He also shared the fact that he saw himself as an actor playing comedy, rather than as a comedian. Regarding his army service, Knotts was reported to say that he was relieved that he was able to spend most of his service entertaining troops rather than in combat. That's where he delivered his ventriloquist act, \\"Danny \\"Hooch\\" Matador\\". Still, the anecdote about him throwing the dummy overboard might be more of a reflection of his comedic and storytelling style, rather than an actual occurrence. His transition back to civilian life and getting into show business, particularly his years on \\"Search for Tomorrow\\", \\"The Steve Allen Show\\", \\"No Time for Sergeants\\", and his eventual big break that lead to his fame, would have been periods of growth and development in his career.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described is the establishment of a stable and consistent warm environment within the greenhouse, promoting optimal plant growth and development. This process, known as the greenhouse effect, occurs through the following stages: 1. Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse: As the sun emits its rays down to Earth, these rays, composed of various forms of radiation (including visible light and infrared radiation), penetrate the transparent or translucent glass or plastic panels of the greenhouse, enabling the light to enter the structure. 2. The plants and floor absorb the sunlight: Once the sunlight enters the greenhouse, it is absorbed by the surfaces it encounters, such as the plants, floor, and other objects present. This absorption is particularly efficient in plants, as they require sunlight for photosynthesis – the process by which they transform light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. 3. The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat: As the sunlight interacts with the surfaces it encounters, the absorbed energy is converted into heat (thermal energy). This process occurs as a result of the absorbed photons agitating the molecules of the objects they come into contact with, causing them to vibrate and generate heat. 4. The heat cannot escape the glass: The glass or plastic panels of the greenhouse act as an insulator, preventing the heat generated within the structure from readily escaping. This is because the materials used for the panels have a lower thermal conductivity, meaning that they do not efficiently transfer heat from their interior surface to their exterior surface. 5. The heat is trapped in the greenhouse: As a result of the insulating properties of the greenhouse panels, the heat generated within the structure remains trapped, leading to a gradual increase in the internal temperature. This effectively creates a warm and stable environment, ideal for encouraging plant growth. 6. The hot air rises: As the internal temperature of the greenhouse increases, the hot air within the structure becomes lighter and less dense. Consequently, this hot air rises toward the top of the greenhouse, creating a natural circulation of air within the structure. 7. The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom: As the hot air rises, it displaces the cooler, denser air located at the top of the greenhouse. This cooler air is then pushed downward, where it comes into contact with the warm surfaces (plants, floor, and other objects) and absorbs heat. As the cooler air heats up, it too becomes less dense, and the process repeats - maintaining a constant circulation of warm air within the greenhouse. Final Step: Establishment of a stable and consistent warm environment for plant growth: Through this continuous process of heat absorption, entrapment, and air circulation, a stable and consistently warm environment is maintained within the greenhouse. This warm environment is ideal for plant growth, as it enables plants to absorb the necessary sunlight, maintain a consistent temperature, and optimize their metabolic processes. Additionally, the higher humidity levels within the greenhouse can further benefit plant growth by reducing water loss through evapotranspiration and providing a more effective means of absorbing nutrients. In turn, this leads to increased plant productivity, improved crop yields, and potentially a longer growing season. Overall, the final step in this process is the creation of an ideal environment for plant growth, taking advantage of the greenhouse effect to maintain a continuous cycle of heat absorption, entrapment, and circulation, ultimately leading to optimal growth conditions for the plants within the greenhouse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: As India’s most remarkable mathematical prodigy, she had astounded friends and family with her numerical prowess since childhood. She once calculated the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in her head in less than a minute, and in June 1980, at Imperial College, London, accurately multiplied two random 13-digit numbers in a few seconds. The sum, picked at random by the computer department, was 7,686,369,774,870 x 2,465,099,745,779. After 28 seconds she correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730, a feat that earned her a place in the Guinness Book of Records. Her ability to solve complicated arithmetical problems with apparent ease and astonishing speed had stunned observers since the 1970s, when her unexplained brain power made even sophisticated digital devices of the day seem inadequate by comparison. Witty and sharp-minded, she possessed exceptional powers of retention and appeared to harness the power of several mnemonic devices in her brain. In 1988 she visited the United States, where the educational psychologist Professor Arthur Jensen tried to unlock the secret of her abilities. At Stanford University he monitored her performance in several mathematical tasks involving large numbers and subjected her to a series of tests. When volunteers wrote problems on a blackboard, Shakuntala Devi would turn around, stare at the problem and come up with the right answer, always in less than a minute. According to Jensen, in a research study published in the journal Intelligence in 1990: “Devi solved most of the problems faster than I was able to copy them in my notebook.” Jensen set her two problems, the cube root of 61,629,875, and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Shakuntala Devi gave the correct answers — 395 and 15 — even before Jensen’s wife could start the stopwatch. The study explored whether Shakuntala Devi’s feats derived from some innate ability to manipulate large numbers or from practice. Her reaction times on simple cognitive tasks such as picking the odd man out were unexceptional, and contrasted sharply with her speed at arithmetical calculations. Jensen suggested that she perceived large numbers differently from others. “For a calculating prodigy like Devi, the manipulation of numbers is apparently like a native language, whereas for most of us, arithmetic calculation is at best like the foreign language we learnt at school,” he wrote. He believed that some “motivational factor” that drives and sustains “enormous and prolonged interest and practice” might explain her extreme levels of skill. Shakuntala Devi was born on November 4 1929 in Bangalore into an orthodox Brahmin family. Her father, refusing to follow the family priestly tradition, became a circus performer, excelling in trapeze, tightrope, lion taming and human cannonball acts. When she was three, Shakuntala began exhibiting precocious skill with numbers, and by the time she was five, could calculate cube roots. A year later she amazed mathematicians at Mysore University with her ability to solve complex mathematical problems in her head. But she had no conventional schooling, mainly on account of her father’s travels with the circus, and even went short of food. She claimed to have joined a convent at the age of 10, but to have been expelled within three months because her parents were unable to pay the fees. While growing up in a run-down area of Bangalore, Shakuntala was able to retain large numbers of digits in her memory. This singular talent came to wider attention when she beat one of the world’s fastest computers by 10 seconds in a complicated calculation. “Numbers have life, they’re not just symbols on paper,” she once said. “I cannot transfer my abilities to anyone, but I can think of quicker ways with which to help people develop numerical aptitude.” A daughter survives her. Shakuntala Devi, born November 4 1929, died April 20 2013 ||||| Shakuntala Devi, an Indian mathematical wizard known as “the human computer” for her ability to make incredibly swift calculations, died on Sunday in Bangalore, India. She was 83. The cause was respiratory and cardiac problems, said D. C. Shivadev, a trustee of the Shakuntala Devi Educational Foundation Public Trust. Ms. Devi demonstrated her mathematical gifts around the world, at colleges, in theaters and on radio and television. In 1977, at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, she extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds, beating a Univac computer, which took 62 seconds. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Shakuntala Devi, an Indian mathematical prodigy known as \\"the human computer,\\" stunned observers with her remarkable ability to perform complex arithmetic calculations mentally and rapidly. Born on November 4, 1929, she demonstrated her skill from an early age despite a lack of formal education. In 1980, she earned a place in the Guinness Book of Records for accurately multiplying two random 13-digit numbers in just 28 seconds. Her incredible performances were studied by educational psychologist Professor Arthur Jensen, who suggested that she perceived and manipulated large numbers differently from others like a native language.

Try to rework your exercise plan if you workout at a moderate intensity or are only doing steady-state cardio for your workouts. Higher intensity exercises and interval training have been shown to help support weight loss better than steady-state cardio. Select from the following. -- Doing high intensity exercises and interval training every day can lower your heart rate which in turn can help maintain bone health and prevent you from growing bored if you stop exercising. Do 30-60 minutes of intense cardio daily. -- Be sure to do 1-3 days of high intensity workouts each week when you're in a fast paced routine. This can help kick that fast-paced, low-intensity workout routines into high intensity mode for you. -- Longer periods of slow, steady exercise may help boost your bmr levels. Aerobic workouts and interval training are particularly helpful since they can help improve brain and heart function. -- Including a few days of higher intensity exercises can help your body burn more calories and more fat per exercise session. If you are unsure of what pace you're maintaining, judge by how well you are able to keep up a conversation. Answer:","completion":"Including a few days of higher intensity exercises can help your body burn more calories and more fat per exercise session. If you are unsure of what pace you're maintaining, judge by how well you are able to keep up a conversation. Explanation: Other answer choices are incorrect due to the following reasons: 1. Doing high intensity exercises and interval training every day can lower your heart rate which in turn can help maintain bone health and prevent you from growing bored if you stop exercising. Do 30-60 minutes of intense cardio daily. - This option is wrong because high intensity exercises and interval training should not be done every day. It can lead to overtraining and increase the risk of injury. Additionally, bone health and preventing boredom are not directly related to the discussed topic of losing weight fast with exercise. 2. Be sure to do 1-3 days of high intensity workouts each week when you're in a fast paced routine. This can help kick that fast-paced, low-intensity workout routines into high intensity mode for you. - This option is unclear and somewhat repetitive. It does not provide a clear explanation about why incorporating high intensity workouts is beneficial for weight loss. 3. Longer periods of slow, steady exercise may help boost your bmr levels. Aerobic workouts and interval training are particularly helpful since they can help improve brain and heart function. - This option is incorrect because it claims that slow, steady exercises can boost basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the energy needed to maintain basic bodily functions. However, the passage emphasizes that high intensity exercises and interval training are more effective for weight loss. Moreover, discussing brain and heart function distracts from the main focus, which is losing weight fast with exercise."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Meanwhile, PM Theresa May admitted support for families in the \\"initial hours\\" was \\"not good enough\\". The statement came after Mrs May met volunteers and some of the people made homeless by the fire. As they left Number 10, one representative spoke to reporters briefly, saying they would not make a full statement yet. \\"We will be making this in the community, with the community,\\" he said. \\"We have had two-and-a-half hours with the prime minister in the last 48 hours and spoke about demands and what we expect.\\" Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said \\"lessons must be learned\\", adding that he was \\"heartbroken by the tragic fire and the appalling loss of life\\" Earlier, residents caught up in the fire condemned the relief effort as \\"absolute chaos\\". In her statement, Mrs May said: \\"Frankly, the support on the ground for families who needed help or basic information in the initial hours after this appalling disaster was not good enough.\\" She said phone lines would be better staffed and more staff would be deployed in the area. They would wear high-visibility clothing so they could easily be found, dispense advice and ensure the right support is provided, she added. Mrs May said she expected to announce the name of the judge for a public inquiry within the next few days. The inquiry will report back to the prime minister. She has told councils to complete urgent safety checks on similar tower blocks. Mr Paget-Brown said: \\"Kensington and Chelsea council is working closely with the government, charities, volunteer and resident groups and the emergency services to help re-house and assist all those affected,\\" he said. \\"Of course, people rightly have questions about the causes of the fire and why it spread so quickly and these will be answered.\\" Commander Cundy appealed for anyone who managed to escape from the building to let authorities know they were safe. Pictures and footage showing the inside of the tower would be released on Sunday to help people understand why the search was taking so long, he said. The search of the building was briefly stalled for safety reasons but resumed on Saturday. \\"As soon as we can, we will locate and recover loved ones,\\" he said. In her official birthday message, the Queen reflected on the \\"sombre national mood\\" following tragedies in London and Manchester in recent weeks.

In other developments: Mrs May has come in for a barrage of criticism over her response to the disaster, including being jeered when she visited the North Kensington estate on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, hundreds of protesters gathered in Whitehall, to call for her resignation. First Secretary of State Damian Green has defended the prime minister, saying she was as \\"distraught as we all are\\". The government has committed Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies for the victims. The BBC's Matthew Price said senior members of the residents' association described an \\"absolute chaos\\" of \\"no organisation\\" from officials. Some residents said they no longer wanted Kensington and Chelsea council to be involved in any way. He added: \\"They do not believe they are capable of managing the response.

Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare. - Lake Erie is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the thirteenth-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is deep. Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake. - Downtown Cleveland is the central business district of the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, United States. It is the economic and symbolic center of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area. As of 2000, 100,000 people worked in the district; as of 2012, it contained more than 16 million square feet of rentable office space. - The Lettermen is an American male pop vocal trio. The Lettermen's trademark is close-harmony pop songs with light arrangements. The group started in 1959. They have had two Top 10 singles (both #7), 16 Top 10 singles on the Adult Contemporary chart (including one #1), 32 consecutive Billboard Magazine chart albums, 11 gold records, and five Grammy nominations. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\". - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family. - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. - The O'Jays are an American R&B group from Canton , Ohio , formed in 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert ( born June 16 , 1942 ) , Walter Williams ( born August 25 , 1943 ) , William Powell ( January 20 , 1942 -- May 26 , 1977 ) , Bobby Massey and Bill Isles . The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with \`\` Lonely Drifter '' in 1963 , but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff , a team of producers and songwriters , signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972 . With Gamble & Huff , the O'Jays ( now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey ) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with \`\` Back Stabbers '' ( 1972 ) , and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with \`\` Love Train '' . Numerous other hits followed through the 1970s and into the 80s and 90s , and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 , and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 . - Philadelphia soul, sometimes called Philly soul, the Philadelphia sound or Sweet Philly, is a genre of soul music characterized by funk influences and lush instrumental arrangements, often featuring sweeping strings and piercing horns. The subtle sound of a vibraphone can often be heard in the background of Philly soul songs. The genre laid the groundwork for disco and what are now considered quiet storm and smooth jazz by fusing the R&B rhythm sections of the 1960s with the pop vocal tradition, and featuring a slightly more pronounced jazz influence in its melodic structures and arrangements. - Smooth jazz is a popular genre of music that grew out of jazz and is influenced by rhythm and blues, funk, rock and roll, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). Musicians such as Kenny G, Ramsey Lewis, Dave Koz, and Spyro Gyra have had hits with instrumental recordings, while singers such as Anita Baker, Sade, Sting and Norah Jones have found success with vocal releases. George Benson remains a popular Smooth Jazz artist as both a singer and guitar player. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Quiet storm is a radio format and a subgenre of contemporary R&B music that is characterized by understated, mellow dynamics, slow tempos, and relaxed rhythms. It was pioneered in the mid-1970s by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the radio station WHUR-FM in Washington, D.C.. This style of R&B music is named for Smokey Robinson's 1976 single \\"Quiet Storm\\". - Back Stabbers is a studio album by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays, released in August 1972 on Philadelphia International Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1972. - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) was organized to honor outstanding vocal groups throughout the world by Tony Butala, also the founder (and now only surviving original member) of The Lettermen. Headquartered in Sharon, Pennsylvania, United States, it includes a theater and a museum. - North Coast Harbor is a district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on the shore of Lake Erie. The district serves as the home of the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, FirstEnergy Stadium, the Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum, the USS \\"Cod\\", Burke Lakefront Airport, Voinovich Bicentennial Park, and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. It is served by the West 3rd and North Coast stations on RTA's light rail Waterfront Line. - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Philadelphia International Records (PIR) is an American record label based in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1971 by the writer-producer duo, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, along with their long time collaborator Thom Bell. It was famous for showcasing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly soul) that was founded on the gospel, doo-wop, and soul music of the time. This Philly Soul sound later became a prominent and distinct era within R&B itself. During the 1970s the label released a string of worldwide hits which emphasized lavish orchestral instrumentation, heavy bass, and driving percussion. - \\"Love Train\\" is a hit single by The O'Jays, written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Released in 1972, it reached number one on both the R&B Singles and the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, in February and March 1973 respectively, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold by the RIAA. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\" part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion. - Ahmet Ertegun (Turkish spelling: Ahmet Ertegün; ( December 14, 2006) was a Turkish-American businessman, songwriter and philanthropist. - Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegün and Herb Abramson. Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.

To help increase your grip strength, try incorporating exercises like hand extensions into your regular exercise routine. This exercise is not really a grip exercise, but it will strengthen the muscles that help to give you a strong grip. You can either use a thick rubber band (or multiple rubber bands) or get a professional tool that helps you perform this exercise. To use the rubber bands, pull the rubber band down over your hand so that it's resting near the base of your fingers. In a slow and controlled way, spread your fingers and thumbs out away from your palm. They should be pushing against the rubber band. Hold your fingers and thumbs as long as you can against the pressure of the rubber band. Repeat a few times on each hand. Another great exercise to try is by squeezing a hand gripper. You will need to get a gripper, which is a handheld grip exerciser that you squeeze with 1 hand at a time. Squeezing a gripper will help strengthen your grip by working the muscles in your hand. Hold on to a gripper in each hand or work 1 hand at a time. Wrap your entire hand around the handles. Make sure the grippers have a plastic coating to help make this exercise comfortable. Squeeze the handles so they are close together (this would typically open the gripper so it could be placed around a barbell). Hold this squeeze for as long as you can. Repeat a few reps with each hand. Another great exercise to strengthen the muscles in your palms are plate pinches. Grab a few conventional weighted plates to get started on this exercise. Place 1 or more 10 pound plates together with the smoother side facing out. Pinch or squeeze them together with your hands (thumb on 1 side and 4 fingers on the other side) and hold them as long as you can in the air. Keep the plates closer to the floor in case you drop 1. Also, do not hold them over your feet. Try to work up to being able to hold four 10 pound plates in each hand for at least 1 minute. Repeat two to three times if you can. If you have barbells that have a wider circumference than the standard barbells, these are a great tool to use to help improve your grip strength as well. Improving your grip strength with a fat or wide barbell is easy and simple to do. Grab 1 of these barbells with both hands and squeeze as tight as you can. Your fingers and thumbs should not be able to touch when your fist is clasped around the bar. To make this exercise more difficult, add plates to either side of the bar. Your goal should be to hold this bar for at least 1 minute and repeat for 1 or 2 more sets.","completion":"Increase grip strength by incorporating exercises such as hand extensions with rubber bands, squeezing hand grippers, performing plate pinches with weighted plates, and working with fat or wide barbells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She is the only child of Wilbur Rimes and Belinda Butler. The family moved to Garland, Texas when she was six. She was enrolled in vocal and dance classes, and was performing at local talent shows at the age of 5. In January 2005, Rimes released her seventh studio album, This Woman, her first album of contemporary country music in many years. Although the album received mixed reviews from magazines and critics, it was Rimes's best-selling album in over five years, reaching No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in 2005, selling more than 100,000 copies within its first week. Rimes explained to the Chicago Sun-Times that the album helped mature her as a person, \\"I have 10 years of experience, so it's tough to get anything past me in this business. I've become a very strong woman because of all I've gone through, good and bad.\\" This Woman would eventually be certified \\"Gold\\" later in 2005, after selling more than 500,000 units nationwide. The album's singles were Rimes's first Top 10 hits on the Hot Country Songs chart in five years. The three singles released from the album--\\"Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense\\", \\"Probably Wouldn't Be This Way\\", and \\"Something's Gotta Give\\"--all peaked within the Top 5 on the country charts between 2005 and 2006. From the album, Rimes was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". In addition, she was also nominated for an American Music Award for \\"Favorite Female Country Artist.\\" In 2006, Rimes recorded a cover version of Barbara Mandrell's \\"If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want to Be Right)\\", for a tribute album to Mandrell's career titled, She Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool: A Tribute to Barbara Mandrell. Rimes also would record a track for Disneyland's 50th anniversary celebration album titled, \\"Remember When.\\" In summer 2006, Rimes released the studio album Whatever We Wanna, which was released exclusively outside of the United States and Canada. It was originally planned on being released in North America, however due to the success of This Woman, it was never released. The album spawned three singles, \\"And It Feels Like\\", a duet with Brian McFadden titled, \\"Everybody's Someone\\" and \\"Strong\\".

He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\".

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: David Robinson was born in Key West, Florida, the second child of Ambrose and Freda Robinson. Since Robinson's father was in the Navy, the family moved many times. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. He was 5 feet, 9 inches tall in junior high school; he tried his hand at basketball, but soon quit. Robinson married Valerie Hoggatt in 1991. They have three sons, David Jr., Corey, and Justin. Corey attends Notre Dame and was a member of the football team, playing wide receiver, before ending his playing career on medical advice prior to what would have been his senior season in 2016 due to multiple concussions. He will remain very active on campus in his final undergraduate year, having been elected in February 2016 as student body president for the 2016-17 school year. Justin, a 6'8\\" (2.03 m) forward in basketball and a two-time all-state selection in Texas, has attended Duke since August 2015. He was initially recruited to the Duke team as a \\"preferred walk-on\\" with the opportunity to eventually earn a scholarship, but was placed on scholarship before his arrival at Duke. Robinson identifies his religious affiliation as Christian. Robinson has stated that he became a Christian on June 8, 1991 after being encouraged to read the Bible. In 2001, Robinson founded and funded the 9 million Carver Academy in San Antonio, a non-profit private school named for George Washington Carver to provide more opportunities for inner-city children. In 2012, the school became a public charter school and its name changed to IDEA Carver. Robinson continues to be a very active participant in the school's day-to-day activities. In 2011, Robinson earned a Master of Arts in Administration (with concentration in organizational development) from the University of the Incarnate Word to better \\"understand how businesses work and how to build them.\\". Beyond his founding of Carver Academy, Robinson is well known as a philanthropist. Robinson and business partner Daniel Bassichis donate 10 percent of their profits to charitable causes. The winner of the NBA Community Assist Award is presented with the David Robinson Plaque. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"This article sheds light on several interesting aspects of David Robinson's life beyond his well-known career as a basketball player. Firstly, it highlights how Robinson's family frequently moved due to his father's career in the Navy before finally settling in Woodbridge, Virginia. Despite his initial lack of success at basketball in his youth, he eventually grew taller and excelled in the sport. Another intriguing aspect of Robinson's life is his strong commitment to his Christian faith, which began on June 8, 1991, after he was encouraged to read the Bible. His faith has remained an integral part of his identity throughout his life. Robinson's dedication to education and the betterment of society, particularly for inner-city children, is exemplified by his founding of the Carver Academy in San Antonio in 2001. The school was initially a non-profit private institution, before becoming a public charter school in 2012 and being renamed IDEA Carver. Robinson remains actively involved in the school's daily operations. Furthermore, the article delves into Robinson's pursuit of higher education, revealing that in 2011, he earned a Master of Arts in Administration from the University of the Incarnate Word, with a concentration in organizational development. This degree has allowed him to better understand and build businesses, which has contributed to his career as a philanthropist. In his philanthropic endeavors, Robinson and his business partner Daniel Bassichis donate 10 percent of their profits to charitable causes.

Text: An acoustic-electric guitar (also called an electro-acoustic guitar) is an acoustic guitar fitted with a magnetic pickup, a piezoelectric pickup or a microphone. In electric-acoustic nylon string guitars, piezoelectric pickups and microphones are always used because magnetic pickups are not capable of picking up vibrations of non-magnetic materials. The design is distinct from a semi-acoustic guitar, which is an electric guitar but with the addition of sound chambers within the guitar body. Usually, acoustic-electric guitars are fitted with piezoelectric pickups, and hence require a preamplifier incorporated into the guitar body to amplify the signal before it travels to the main guitar amplifier. These preamps may also come with tone controls of varying types, but usually equalizers with up to six frequency bands are used. They are also referred to as a \`\`plug-in acoustic guitar'', due to their ability to simply \`\`plug in'' to a speaker system without the need for microphones. Question: can a guitar be both acoustic and electric? Choices: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"Answer: (2). yes. Justification: The text describes an acoustic-electric guitar (also called an electro-acoustic guitar) as an acoustic guitar fitted with a magnetic pickup, a piezoelectric pickup, or a microphone.

Acoustic-electric guitars can be plugged into a speaker system without the need for microphones, which is a characteristic of electric guitars. Thus, a guitar can indeed be both acoustic and electric."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I didn't think much of it. At the time I was eleven years old, so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still didn't think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers. Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. Until two months ago I couldn't have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum, I really had no intentions of watching it. But then I decided to go back and re-watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions. So I went out and bought both the original movies. And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them. Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn't far behind. They're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them. Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint! Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne movies, I'd seen him in the Talented Mr Ripley, but I never thought much of him in general. However, it appears he was born to play Bourne (pardon the pun). Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see Matt Damon at his very best, even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed. You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. Joan Allen was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy, here she excels herself. Her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. Julia Stiles turns up again as Nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. Julia Stiles is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen, he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. He's definitely the nastiest character we've met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. Special mention must also go to Albert Finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, I will not say anything about the character, that's best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie. The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. As I watched Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum it was nice because I could notice certain little parts. That very final scene in Supremacy, in New York, a lot more important that I ever imagined at the time. Won't spoil it for people but I recommend checking up on Supremacy before you see Ultimatum. Unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see Ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. This is the part where I should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases. The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series. In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow. So in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. A bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! But the highlight for me has to be the scene in Waterloo station, won't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped. So any flaws for the movie? In my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the previous two then I wouldn't recommend Ultimatum for you. The movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. While Bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is positive. The writer talks about how they became a fan of the Bourne series, praises the acting and storyline, and says that the Bourne Ultimatum is the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007.

Answer the following question: We all remember seeing hitchhikers , standing by the side of the road, thumb sticking out, waiting for a lift. But it is getting rare nowadays. What killed hitchhiking? Safety is often mentioned as a reason. Movies about murderous hitchhikers and real-life crime have put many drivers off picking up hitchhikers. That no single women picked me up on my journey to Manchester no doubt reflects the safety fear: a large, strangely dressed man is seen as dangerous. But the reason may be more complex: hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are poor. Plenty of people still hitchhike in Poland and Romania. Perhaps the rising level of car ownership in the UK means the few people lift hitchhiking are usually considered strange. Why can't they afford cars? Why can't they take the coach or the train? Three-quarters of the UK population have access to a car; many of the remainder will be quite old. The potential hitchhiking population is therefore small. Yet my trip proves it's still possible to hitchhike. The people who picked me up were very interesting-lawyer, retired surgeon, tank commander, carpenter, man who live in an isolated farmhouse and a couple living up in the mountains. My conclusion is that only really interesting people are mad enough to pick up fat blokes in red, spotted scarves. Most just wanted to do someone a good turn; a few said they were so surprised to see a hitchhiker that they couldn't help stopping. The future of hitchhiking most likely lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers. org. But for now, you can still stick your thumb out(actually, I didn't do much of that, preferring just to hold up my destination sign) and people-wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people-will stop. In the UK, with its cheap coaches and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it. But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip across Europe and beyond.

Crowe becomes dedicated to this patient, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife begins to fall apart due to his focus on work.Once Crowe earns his trust, Cole eventually confides in him that he \\"sees dead people that walk around like regular people.\\" Though Crowe at first thinks Cole is delusional, he eventually comes to believe that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts, perhaps to aid them in their unfinished business on Earth. Cole at first does not want to, because the ghosts terrify him, but he soon decides to try it. One is an overworked wife abused by her husband who slit her wrists; another that tries to hurt Cole is only heard as a voice who starts calmly pleading to Cole to let him out of the dark cupboard because he's suffocating, then yells at Cole that he didn't steal \\"the Master's horse\\" and threatens to attack Cole if he doesn't obey.

CHAPTER XVIII: DOUBLE, DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE 'Truly the tender mercies of the weak, As of the wicked, are but cruel.' And how did Lilias show that she had been truly benefited by her sorrows? Did she fall back into her habits of self-indulgence, or did she run into ill-directed activity, selfish as her indolence, because only gratifying the passion of the moment? Those who lived with her saw but little change; kind-hearted and generous she had ever been, and many had been her good impulses, so that while she daily became more steady in well-doing, and exerting herself on principle, no one remarked it, and no one entered into the struggles which it cost her to tame her impetuosity, or force herself to do what was disagreeable to herself, and might offend Emily. However, Emily could forgive a great deal when she found that Lily was ready to take any part of the business of the household and schoolroom, which she chose to impose upon her, without the least objection, yet to leave her to assume as much of the credit of managing as she chose--to have no will or way of her own, and to help her to keep her wardrobe in order. The schoolroom was just now more of a labour than had ever been the case, at least to one who, like Lilias, if she did a thing at all, would not be satisfied with half doing it. Phyllis was not altered, except that she cried less, and had in a great measure cured herself of dawdling habits and tricks, by her honest efforts to obey well- remembered orders of Eleanor's; but still her slowness and dulness were trying to her teachers, and Lily had often to reproach herself for being angry with her 'when she was doing her best.' 1.

Asoka is a child when his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, decides to renounce the throne to become a Jainist monk. Before his departure, Asoka's grandfather finds out that Asoka stole his sword and he confronts him. Chandragupta tells Asoka that his sword is cursed to taste blood whenever it is drawn, and he throws it into a creek. After he leaves, Asoka finds the sword and keeps it. The throne goes to Asoka's father, Bindusara, and the movie skips to Asokas adulthood. Bindusara is about to renounce the throne to his successor. He names his son Susima, who has the support of all his brothers except Asoka. When the movie picks up, Asoka is leading his troops in battle against the Takshila army, who have an advantage in numbers. Asoka prevails and kills the leader of the Takshilas. He comes home alive and unharmed, which angers Susima. Susima had ordered General Shivrath to make Asoka conquer Takshila with half an army, expecting Asoka to die in the struggle. Susima orders Shivrath dead and hires an assassin to kill Asoka while he is bathing. Asoka kills the assassin with ease and goes to visit his mother. His mother expresses concern and tells Asoka to leave the city, threatening to take a vow of silence if he does not. Not wanting his mother to never speak to anyone again, Asoka reluctantly leaves. Asoka wanders around, going under the name Pawan, and encounters a beautiful woman. He is immediately stricken with love, and he follows her. After hearing a request for the capture of Princess Kaurwaki and Prince Arya of Kalinga, Asoka saves the woman from attackers who wanted to collect the reward. He discovers that the woman is Princess Kaurwaki and she is escaping from the capital after the prime minister assassinated their parents.

The growing field of \\"music treatment\\" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not. The results showed that people who listened to music for an hour each day for a week improved physically and psychologically while those who did not listen to music did not.

Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve for \\"q\\" in the given equation, I'll first combine the like terms, then isolate the variable. Step 1: Combine like terms. The like terms are -174q and -126q. Multiplying terms belong to the same variable (in this case q) is known as combining like terms. -174q - 126q = -300q So the equation becomes: -300q - 600 = 0 Step 2: Move the constant (which is -600) to the other side of the equation. I'll do this by adding 600 to both sides of the equation. The idea here is to move the constant on one side (making the equation equal to Zero) to the other side, and thus isolate the variable. So, -300q = 600 Step 3: Solve for q. To isolate q, divide both sides of the equation by -300. q = 600 / -300 = -2. So, the solution to the equation is q = -2.

Write an article based on this summary: A gay man in central China has won an apology and compensation from a mental hospital over forced conversion therapy, reports say.","completion":"Title: A Historic Victory: Gay Man in Central China Wins Compensation and Apology for Forced Conversion Therapy Introduction In a groundbreaking decision, a mental hospital in central China has been ordered to issue an apology and pay compensation for subjecting a gay man to forced conversion therapy. The hospital's actions were condemned by the court as a violation of the plaintiff's personal and human rights. This remarkable victory represents a significant step forward in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in China, where homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 but stigmatization and discrimination remain persistent problems. Background on Conversion Therapy Conversion therapy, also known as \\"reparative therapy\\" or \\"sexual orientation change efforts,\\" is a highly controversial and discredited practice that seeks to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. Its methods can involve counseling, psychoanalysis, and even physical treatments, such as electric shock therapy and hormonal intervention. Opponents of conversion therapy argue that these techniques are psychologically harmful and based on scientifically unproven theories. Numerous mental health organizations, including the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Pan American Health Organization, have publicly condemned the practice. The Plaintiff's Experience In the landmark case, the plaintiff (whose identity remains confidential) underwent forced conversion therapy at a mental hospital in the central Chinese province of Henan. According to reports, the man had not consented to the treatment, and he was forcibly committed to the hospital by his family, who refused to accept his sexual orientation. During his stay at the hospital, the plaintiff was reportedly subjected to physical and emotional abuse. He was forced to endure violent beatings, dehydration, and sleep deprivation, in addition to a cocktail of medications with severe side effects. The plaintiff's ordeal continued for nearly three months until he was finally released following a public outcry and intervention by a local LGBTQ+ rights group. The Court's Ruling An important victory for LGBTQ+ rights in China, the court ruled that the hospital's actions constituted a gross violation of the plaintiff's personal and human rights. The decision emphasized the importance of the right to personal freedom, a provision enshrined in the Chinese Constitution, and highlighted that conversion therapy is not a valid medical procedure. As a result of this landmark ruling, the mental hospital was ordered to issue a public apology to the plaintiff and pay compensation in the sum of 5,000 yuan (approximately 775 USD). Though monetary compensation may not reverse the physical and emotional harm inflicted upon the victim, it sends a powerful message reinforcing the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals in China. Implications and Future Prospects This groundbreaking case has significant implications for LGBTQ+ rights in China, where the struggle for social acceptance and legal protection is far from over. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997 and removed from the list of mental illnesses in 2001, the community still faces a myriad of challenges, including discrimination, stigmatization, and lack of access to proper medical care. The historic ruling against the mental hospital may serve as a catalyst for change, empowering other victims of forced conversion therapy to come forward and demand justice. It also highlights the need for further amendments to China's laws to explicitly ban conversion therapy and provide stronger protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. Conclusion The recent verdict in central China marks a significant milestone in the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the country. It demonstrates that there is a growing awareness and rejection of discriminatory practices like forced conversion therapy among both the judiciary and the general population. While this single case does not guarantee an immediate end to discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals in China, it does represent a step in the right direction toward greater acceptance, tolerance, and legal protection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition.

The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Patton leading 90,000 men of the Seventh United States Army in a landing near Gela, Scoglitti, and Licata to support Bernard Montgomery's British 8th Army landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took Palermo after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of Nazi Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. Patton then set his sights on Messina. He sought an amphibious assault, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in Santo Stefano until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy.

The less celebrated Murray sibling was recalled to the GB side for the first time since 2011 when the squad was announced on Tuesday morning for the prestigious fixture starting a week on Friday at the Emirates Arena. There is every likelihood that he and his brother will be thrown into the doubles to tackle the world number one twins Bob and Mike Bryan, although Captain Leon Smith has also included GB doubles number two Dom Inglot as another option. Andy Murray is set to play in all three of Great Britain's Davis Cup matches against USA next month. Murray could be partnered in the doubles alongside his brother Jamie for the clash at the Glasgow Arena. Jamie Murray has earned his place having reviving his career in the last two years after it had slipped into the doldrums. He is now ranked the world's 31st doubles player following victory in the ATP Brisbane Open and reaching the final in Rotterdam earlier this month with Australian foil John Peers. The presence of him and Andy in the team promises to make it an emotional three days, as this will be the first time they have played in Scotland since his younger brother won the Wimbledon title. The world number three is likely to have to take on the responsibility of playing three days in a row, although that could depend on the outcome of the first two singles matches. This will be the first tie in the elite World Group knockout held in the UK since 2002, with the winners going through to face either France or Germany in the last eight. The doubles could decide the tie unless James Ward can produce one of his outstanding Davis Cup performances and upset one of the higher ranked Americans as second singles player. Yorkshire youngster Kyle Edmund will be the travelling reserve. Jamie Murray (right) has been recalled to the GB side for the first time since 2011 after an upturn in form. 'From a selection point of view we've been able to choose our strongest possible team which is spearheaded by Andy Murray who is significantly ahead of where he was 12 months ago,' said Smith. 'The tie will be a huge deal for him personally as he returns to play in Scotland for the first time since winning Wimbledon in 2013. In James Ward we have somebody who has already proven himself against the US Davis Cup team, and I'd back him again to put in another excellent performance after some consistent recent form has seen him on the verge of cracking the top 100 for the first time. 'I've selected our top two doubles players in Jamie and Dom, and again they've showed real consistency this year to earn their place in the team. As a group, all the guys deserve this opportunity.' The American team, captained by Jim Courier, is expected to be made up of world No 20 John Isner, No 44 Steve Johnson and the world champion Bryan brothers.

Jurors Answer:","completion":"Title: The Unsolved Verdict Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Plot: Act I: The film starts in a small, idyllic town known as Willow Springs. There's been a high-profile murder case that has shaken the residents of the town. A well-known philanthropist, Arthur Preston, has been murdered in his mansion. The prime suspect is Jane, Arthur's adopted daughter, who has always been seen as an outsider in the community. The tension and anxiety surrounding the case piques the interest of national media, who descend on the town to cover the trial. The trial begins, and Jane's defense team tries their best to prove her innocence. A group of twelve jurors is assigned to the case, including a diverse mix of individuals from different age groups, professions, backgrounds, and perspectives. Act II: While reviewing the evidence and revisiting the intricate details of the case in the jurors' room, heated debates and arguments arise among the jurors. The Willis siblings, older members in the jury, stick to their inherent belief that Jane is guilty. On the other hand, Martin, a sociology professor, begins to have doubts about Jane's guilt and thinks that the media frenzy might have influenced their opinions. Through flashbacks, we learn about Jane's tough upbringing in foster care, how Arthur took her in at a young age, and his intentions of leaving a significant portion of his wealth for her future. This revelation sparks a discussion about Jane's true motives, deepening the jurors' rift. As the days go by, the jurors become increasingly hostile. Two jurors, Grace and Sam, secretly decide to leave the town and abandon their responsibilities. They are fueled by fear of the growing public scrutiny their decision will invite, especially if they side with Jane, amidst looming threats from Preston's loyal supporters. Act III: The night before the verdict reading, an anonymous tip leads the police to discover new evidence related to the murder. This evidence points to the involvement of Arthur's estranged brother, Henry, in the crime. The jurors are shocked after hearing about this breakthrough and realize the falsification of evidence implicating Jane. The Willis siblings acknowledge their earlier misguided certainty, and the jurors start to stir up feelings of shame, remorse, and self-reflection for their previous judgments. A unanimous decision of Jane's innocence is finally reached, but the two missing jurors, Grace and Sam, delay the verdict. A search for the two begins, eventually leading to their discovery at a motel, tormented by overwhelming guilt for abandoning the case. The other jurors persuade them to return, and together they announce the verdict. Act IV: Jane is acquitted, and the town's attention shifts to Henry, revealing a deeply envious sibling rivalry and hidden conspiracies behind Arthur's murder. Jane forgives the town for their judgment and leaves Willow Springs to start afresh. The twelve jurors, each affected profoundly by the trial's emotional rollercoaster, learn valuable life lessons about empathy, fairness, and the dangers of prejudice. They leave the courthouse with a newfound understanding of their civic duties and the importance of critical thinking in pursuing justice. The Unsolved Verdict becomes a symbol of the impact that society's hasty conclusions can have on the administration of justice and a reminder that the truth prevails only through patient inquiry and the courage to question the status quo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016.

Here are possible answers to this question: - herpes - sexual stimulation - catch cold - outburst - get cold I believe the correct choice is \\"get cold\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"When kissing outside, various things can happen, but the correct choice from the given list would be \\"get cold.\\" Here is a step by step justification for my choice: 1. Analyze the context: The question asks for the possible outcomes of kissing outside, which suggests that the focus is on the environmental factors that can affect the experience. 2. Eliminate less relevant options: While it is true that herpes can be transmitted through kissing, it is not specific to kissing outside. Sexual stimulation, too, can happen during any kissing situation, regardless of the environment. An outburst is also not specifically related to kissing outside, as it could occur even in an indoor setting. 3. Check for any valid options: \\"Catch cold\\" and \\"get cold\\" seem similar but are not quite the same. While it is possible for two people to catch a cold when kissing outdoors, this is not necessarily limited to outdoor situations, and it would typically require an infected person to be involved. 4. Choose the most relevant option: \\"Get cold\\" is the most fitting choice in this context. Kissing outside, especially in cold or rainy weather, can lead to both people getting cold due to exposure to the elements. The decrease in body temperature caused by the surrounding environment can make people feel cold. Thus, among the given options, \\"get cold\\" is the most relevant outcome when kissing outside, as it is directly influenced by the environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: This article: Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, \\"There were five of you; now there are six\\". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not... contains an answer for the question: What was the first names of Tchaikovsky's two biographers?, what is it ?

Even more unsettling, the biggest dealers were from the U.S. When I was a young punk kid, it was fashionable to say things like, \\"The military-industrial complex is taking over the world.\\" At the time, I didn't know what \\"military-industrial complex\\" meant, but the conference rapidly provided me with a very literal definition of the term. SOFEX takes place every two years in Amman, and is largely the brainchild of Jordan's King Abdullah II, who has a penchant for special operations and massive displays of artillery. Over the course of a week, more than 12,000 attendees tromped through massive tents housing hundreds of arms manufacturers.

After a scoreless third quarter, Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the fourth quarter as wide receiver Antwaan Randle El found wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 39-yard touchdown pass. Cincinnati tried to rally as Palmer completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Owens, followed by running back Cedric Benson getting a 1-yard touchdown run, thanks in no small part to two consecutive penalties called against the Steelers, both of which were later deemed by the NFL to have been incorrect.

(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.

Question: What way of thought combines real life and the abstract? Context: In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose. The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s. James popularized the term \\"pragmatism\\", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of \\"pragmaticism\\".

Here is an example of a negative review for a hypothetical restaurant: Title: Disappointing Dining Experience Rating: 1.5/5 I recently visited [Restaurant Name] with my family, hoping for a delightful evening with delicious food and warm ambiance. Unfortunately, our experience was far from what we had expected, and I feel compelled to share our disappointment with others considering dining here. Upon arrival, we were initially impressed by the restaurant's modern and inviting décor, but it took nearly 20 minutes for the host to seat us. Despite having made a reservation well in advance, they appeared to be disorganized and struggling to handle the volume of customers. Once seated, the inefficiency continued. Our server quickly took our drink and appetizer orders, but it took almost 30 minutes for them to arrive. When our appetizers did finally arrive, we found them to be quite underwhelming. The calamari was overcooked, and the accompanying dipping sauce was bland and watery. Our main courses were equally disappointing. My steak frites arrived cold, with a meager portion of fries that tasted stale. The steak itself was poorly seasoned and considerably overcooked, ruining the overall texture of the dish. My wife's pasta dish was excessively salty and the sauce tasted strongly of garlic, overpowering the delicate flavors of the seafood. The highlight of the meal was the dessert, which showed signs of culinary skill and imagination. However, by that point, we were so disenchanted with our overall experience that the high-quality dessert couldn't redeem the evening. We tried to provide feedback to our server, but they seemed hurried and uninterested, only offering a lukewarm apology without any opportunity for further discussion. In conclusion, our dining experience at [Restaurant Name] left much to be desired. The service was disorganized and slow, while the food was underwhelming and poorly executed. Although the dessert showed some promise, it wasn't enough to mitigate the other issues. We hoped to enjoy a special evening but were severely disappointed, and I cannot recommend [Restaurant Name] to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The current champions are the Bentley Generals of Alberta, who captured the 2016 Allan Cup in Steinbach, Manitoba. - St. Moritz (also , , ) is a high Alpine luxury resort in the Engadine in Switzerland, at an elevation of about above sea level. It is Upper Engadine's major village and a municipality in the district of Maloja in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Engadin or Engadine (, , ; lit.: \\"Valley of the Inn people\\") is a long high Alpine valley region in the eastern Swiss Alps located in the canton of Graubünden in most southeastern Switzerland with about 25,000 inhabitants.

The En/Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Donau, as the only Swiss river. The Engadine is protected by high mountain ranges on all sides and is famous for its sunny climate, beautiful landscapes and outdoor activities. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe.

Elevation, or geometric height, is mainly used when referring to points on the Earth's surface, while altitude or geopotential height is used for points above the surface, such as an aircraft in flight or a spacecraft in orbit, and depth is used for points below the surface. - The 1948 Winter Olympics, officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Ves Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\") (German: \\"Olympische Winterspiele 1948\\") (Italian: \\"V Giochi olimpici invernali\\") (Romansh: \\"Gieus olimpics d'enviern 1948\\"), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in 1948 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The Games were the first to be celebrated after World War II; it had been 12 years since the last Winter Games in 1936. From the selection of a host city in a neutral country to the exclusion of Japan and Germany, the political atmosphere of the post-war world was inescapable during the Games. The organizing committee faced several challenges due to the lack of financial and human resources consumed by the war.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Many people commit the cardinal sin of breaking up via text or Facebook. Doing it that way will not signal that you really care. Show this person respect at the end because you won’t maintain a friendship if the break up goes badly. Talking in person will let you break down everything that you want to say. It will also allow your significant other the chance to respond instead of feeling shut out. Remember that not giving people closure makes them suffer psychologically. Don’t do that if you want to stay friends because no one likes to be left hanging. You can use body language to guide the conversation if you meet in person. If your partner has rigid shoulders, is open-mouthed, or looks down a lot, you’ll know that the conversation is upsetting to them. If your partner seems relaxed and maybe even smiles, you’ll know you are not delivering blows. This is an important discussion, and you both need to be focused, so having it just anywhere won’t help you get your point across. To stay friends, remember that atmosphere counts. Avoid places that are crowded. You need privacy, not some busy body at the next table eavesdropping on every word. Don’t go somewhere that the two of you used to go together. That will bring up sad memories for you both. Pick a park, a large, open cafe or other locale where the two of you can have space. Definitely don’t meet at one of your houses, which will be uncomfortable. No one wants to hear “It’s me, not you.” Starting off in such an insincere way won’t help the break up talk go smoothly and you will end up insulting your ex. If you aren’t attracted to the person anymore, you can tell them that, but be gentle, of course. If you don’t see a future due to different life goals, that is a legitimate reason. Simply say, \\"Joe, I am trying to find a job that will allow me to travel, and you're a homebody. A long-term relationship probably just isn't right for us.\\" Maybe you feel that the differences in your communication styles will cause problems down the road. Try saying something like, \\"We have misunderstandings far too often. We can probably find other people that understand us better.\\" Even though you don't want to continue seeing this person, there's no need to criticize every little thing about them. Don't criticize your ex's family. You're not going to date this person anymore, so there is no reason to announce that his siblings were bossy and his mom was nosy. Don't blame their pets. If you were allergic to the cat in the beginning of the year-long relationship and stayed around, that cat has nothing to do with the break up. Making other trivial claims, like that they live too far away, is just not necessary. More reasons won’t make the person getting dumped feel better. Summary:","completion":"Breaking up with someone through text or social media is disrespectful and can hinder the possibility of maintaining a friendship after the relationship ends. Instead, opt for an in-person conversation that allows both parties to express their thoughts and feelings. Be mindful of the location for the discussion, choosing a quiet and neutral place that does not hold any personal significance for the two of you. When initiating the breakup, avoid cliches and be honest about your reasons for ending the relationship. Focus on legitimate concerns, such as differing life goals or incompatible communication styles. There is no need to criticize every aspect of your partner or bring up irrelevant issues like their family or pets. By being gentle, honest, and respectful during the breakup, you increase the chances of maintaining a friendship after the relationship has ended."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bowe Bergdahl leaves a motions hearing during a lunch break in Fort Bragg, N.C. The fate of Bergdahl rests in a judge’s hands now that the Army sergeant has pleaded guilty to endangering his comrades by leaving his post in Afghanistan in 2009. Sentencing... (Associated Press) FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) — The judge deciding Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's punishment said Monday he is concerned that President Donald Trump's comments about the case could impact the public's perception of the military justice system. Sentencing was set to begin Monday for Bergdahl on charges that he endangered comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009. But the judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance, instead heard last-minute arguments by defense attorneys that recent comments by Trump are preventing a fair proceeding. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Nance allowed the attorneys to question him about whether he was swayed by Trump's comments. Nance said he wasn't aware of the comments beyond what was in the legal motions. Nance said he plans to retire as a colonel in about a year and isn't motivated by pleasing commanders to win a future promotion. \\"I don't have any doubt whatsoever that I can be fair and impartial in the sentencing in this matter,\\" Nance said. But he had stern words and pointed questions for prosecutors about what effect Trump's comments would have on public perception of the case. He indicated he would issue a written ruling later on the defense request to have the case thrown out over Trump's comments. While campaigning, Trump repeatedly called Bergdahl a \\"dirty, rotten traitor\\" who deserved to be executed by firing squad or thrown out of a plane without a parachute. Nance previously ruled those comments were \\"disturbing\\" but didn't amount to unlawful command influence and noted the statements were made before Trump assumed his position at the top of the armed forces' command structure. But last week Trump addressed his past comments after being asked about them at a news conference. He replied that he couldn't say anything more about the case, \\"but I think people have heard my comments in the past.\\" That, the defense said, shows he harbors the same views as commander in chief. Prosecutors argued Trump's comments didn't reaffirm his campaign-trail criticism and were narrowly focused on answering a reporter. But Nance said he was having a \\"hard time\\" with prosecutors' interpretation, noting public confidence in military courts was something he had to consider. \\"The member of the public that we are interested in maintaining confidence in the military justice system ... is going to be influenced by context,\\" he said. Nance said his interpretation was that Trump was essentially saying: \\"I shouldn't comment on that, but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.\\" The White House issued a statement Friday that any military justice case must be \\"resolved on its own facts.\\" White House media representatives didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Sentencing was set to resume Wednesday because a defense attorney wasn't available Tuesday, the judge said. Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty last week to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Prosecutors made no deal to cap his punishment, so the judge has wide leeway to decide his sentence. Several more days of testimony are expected. Nance is expected to weigh factors including Bergdahl's willingness to admit guilt, his five years of captivity by Taliban allies, and serious wounds suffered by soldiers and a Navy SEAL who searched for him. Prosecutors are expected to present evidence or testimony about several wounded men. Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, was captured soon after walking off his remote post in 2009. He has said he was caged, kept in darkness and beaten, and tried to escape more than a dozen times. He has said his original intention in leaving post was to alert other commanders to what he saw as problems with his unit. Still, when he pleaded guilty, he told the judge his actions were inexcusable. President Barack Obama brought Bergdahl home in 2014 in a swap for five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, saying the U.S. does not leave behind service members. Republicans roundly criticized Obama. ____ Follow Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew . ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 12, 2016, file photo, Army Sgt.

Following his departure, Jason Licht took over the role of general manager. Additionally, Greg Schiano was replaced by Lovie Smith as the head coach. Therefore, Mark Dominik is no longer managing the team. To give you more context and a detailed answer, let's look at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' management changes from the 2013 season to the present day. During the 2013 season, the Buccaneers struggled, which led to major changes in team management. Greg Schiano, who was the head coach at that time, was fired, and Lovie Smith was hired as a replacement. Smith served as the head coach from 2014 to 2015. After a subpar performance by the team under Smith's leadership, he was let go after the 2015 season, and former offensive coordinator, Dirk Koetter, was promoted to head coach in 2016. Koetter worked as the Buccaneers head coach until the end of the 2018 season. At the end of the 2018 season, Bruce Arians was hired as the head coach and has been leading the team since the 2019 season. Under Arians' leadership, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers found success, winning the Super Bowl LV in February 2021, which was their second Super Bowl win in franchise history. As for the general manager position, the Buccaneers replaced Mark Dominik with Jason Licht in 2014. Jason Licht is still serving as the general manager of the team, overseeing all aspects of football operations. In conclusion, the current Tampa Bay Buccaneers management includes Bruce Arians as the head coach and Jason Licht as the general manager.

Upon arriving at Jupiter, the crew detect signs of life on Jupiter's seemingly barren moon Europa. They send an unmanned probe down to Europa to investigate the unusual readings, but just as it finds the source, a mysterious energy burst destroys the probe and its data. The \\"burst\\" then flies toward Jupiter. The Soviets believe the burst was simply electrostatic build-up, but Floyd suspects it was a warning to stay away from Europa. After surviving a dangerous braking maneuver around Jupiter's upper atmosphere, the Leonov crew find the abandoned Discovery floating in space. Curnow reactivates the ship and Chandra restarts HAL, who had been deactivated by Dave Bowman before his disappearance nine years earlier. Also nearby is the giant alien Monolith that the Discovery was originally sent to investigate. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky travels to the Monolith in an EVA pod, at which point the Monolith briefly opens with a burst of energy, sending Max's pod spinning off into space.

Q: Putting it quite bluntly, this book was just no good. By the end of the book I wasn't even sure who the murderer was. I know his name but there were so MANY names, I'm not really sure who he was or how he fit into the story. There were dozens of names of people connected to the story. To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst.

And the answer is...","completion":"Alright, let's solve the problem step by step for the letter \\"v\\"! 1. First, we look at the problem: 15*v - 50*v = 22*v - 513 2. Now, we have two sides separated by an equal sign: on the left side, we have 15*v - 50*v, and on the right side, we have 22*v - 513. 3. Let's find out how many \\"v\\"s we have on the left side. If we have 15 \\"v\\"s and then take away 50 \\"v\\"s, we get -35 \\"v\\"s (because 15 - 50 = -35). So the left side becomes -35*v. 4. Our new problem is -35*v = 22*v - 513 5. The next step is to get all the \\"v\\"s on one side of the equal sign. To do this, we can add 35*v to both sides. On the left side, -35*v + 35*v cancels out, so we are left with 0. On the right side, we have 22*v - 513 + 35*v. 6. Combine the \\"v\\"s on the right side: 22*v + 35*v = 57*v. So, we now have the problem 0 = 57*v - 513. 7. Now, let's find out the value of \\"v\\". To do this, we can move 513 to the left side by adding 513 to both sides: 513 = 57*v. 8. Then, we can divide both sides by 57: 513/57 = v. When we do the division, we find that v = 9.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve for s in the equation 24111*s = 26073*s + 133416, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the s variable. To do this, we need to move all the terms with s to one side of the equation. We can subtract 26073*s from both sides of the equation to cancel it out on the right side. 24111*s - 26073*s = 26073*s - 26073*s + 133416 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Combine the terms with s on the left side: (24111 - 26073)*s = 133416 -1962*s = 133416 Step 3: Solve for s. To solve for s, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -1962: (-1962*s) / -1962 = 133416 / -1962 s = -68 So, the value of s in the given equation is -68."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the negative side, some reviewers found the film to be dry, sullen, and lacking the wonder of magic. There are also concerns about the movie being too similar to another film, \\"The Illusionist,\\" leading to potential confusion for audiences. Some critics felt that the movie's attempts to be intellectually stimulating felt forced and insincere, with one comparing it to \\"The Sixth Sense.\\" Additionally, a reviewer mentioned that the magic within the film might be less impressive compared to other 'magical' films released in the same year. In general, it appears that the movie has its strengths, such as its storytelling and performances, but may also have some shortcomings, including its mood, intellectual ambition, and overall impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They would score first in the first quarter when Jason Campbell found Davone Bess on a 1-yard pass for a 7-0 lead. The Ravens would shorten the lead when Justin Tucker nailed a 51-yard field goal to make it 7-3.

The shortest field goal was executed by Billy Cundiff, who managed a 22-yard field goal. To find how many yards longer the longest field goal was than the shortest field goal, subtract the length of the shortest field goal from the longest one: 51 yards (longest field goal) - 22 yards (shortest field goal) = 29 yards.

In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable \\"dream within a dream\\" strategy; and Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles (Michael Caine).

When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream.

Without more information, we can't conclude whether or not Hurt's character speaks much. 2.

Article: Being thirteen has certain problems that only another thirteen-year-old would understand. The biggest, I think, is learning to get along well with adults. I have found that when dealing with grown-ups, it is wise to remember two things: Always use your head. Never use your head. For instance, one day just before supper, my mother sent me to the store for a loaf of whole-wheat bread. They didn't have any. When I told my mother, she said, \\"Well, what kind did you get?\\" I told her I didn't get any. She looked as if I had just announced that I was leaving home for good. \\"For goodness' sake!\\" Said, \\"if they didn't have whole-wheat, you should have got something else! Why don't you use your head?\\" Not long after that, she sent me to the store for red oilcloth. They didn't have any, so I bought seven yards of purple. I thought it was pretty. Mother didn't. She said, \\"who ever heard of purple oilcloth in a red kitchen?\\" I told her I was only trying to use my head. She said, \\"Well, don't! And in the future, if you can't get what I send you for, don't get anything.\\" See what I mean? There are other things that seem a little strange, too. If my father goes out for the evening, he tells me to \\"look after\\" my mother and sister. But if the family goes out, and I want to stay home, my father won't let me. He doesn't feel comfortable if I am home alone. That means I am old enough to \\"look after\\" my mother and sister but not old enough to \\"look after\\" myself. Another problem is what to do when you trip over the cat and land with your head in the refrigerator, causing a large lump to appear just over the right eyebrow. In that case, your father could feel free to say with a few choice words. Your sister could shed enough tears to dampen the whole room. Your mother could, and probably would, do both. But you? You are thirteen and can't do anything! You are too young to curse , and \\"big boys\\" don't cry. So you just stand there looking more stupid than usual.

At Pagan, Kyawswa's son Sawhnit was elected king by the dowager Queen Saw but soon became a governor under the authority of Myinsaing. Another of Kyawswa's sons, Kumara Kassapa, escaped to China. The Mongols did not know about the dethronement until June-July 1298. In 1300, the Myinsaing forces led by Athinkhaya attacked the Mongol garrisons north of Mandalay named Nga Singu and Male. On 22 June 1300, the Mongol Emperor declared that Kumara Kassapa was the rightful king of Burma, and sent in an army from Yunnan. The invasion force reached Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301. The Mongol government at Yunnan executed their commanders but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303. By then, the city of Pagan, once home to 200,000 people, had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. The brothers placed one of Kyawswa's sons as the governor of Pagan. Anawrahta's line continued to rule Pagan as governors under Myinsaing, Pinya and Ava kingdoms until 1369.

Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: Train engine on a train track and releasing steam.","completion":"The most salient words in the given sentence, \\"Train engine on a train track and releasing steam\\" are: 1. Train engine: This term is the core subject of the sentence, as it describes a critical component of the train system. The engine is responsible for propelling the train and is the central element that makes train transportation possible. 2. Train track: This term is also essential in the sentence, as it defines the context in which the train engine operates. Train tracks are the physical infrastructure that allows trains to travel from one location to another. They provide guidance and support for the train, ensuring smooth and accurate movement along a designed route. 3. Releasing steam: This phrase is crucial as it adds a dynamic aspect to the situation being described. It suggests that the train engine is currently active and is likely a steam locomotive, a specific type of train engine that generates power through steam. Releasing steam is a typical byproduct of steam engine operation and indicates a train in motion or preparing to get underway.

Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

Fennell said he had no problem with I’m A Celeb ‘over all’ and enjoys watching it but believes there should ‘at least be an attempt to represent the full diversity of Australia’. ‘It’s a big, fun, cheesy reality event that could do really well… I wouldn’t have put it to air without at least an attempt at some diversity,’ Fennell said.

Question: Article: \\"The world has never been a better place to live in\\" says science writer Matt Ridley, \\"and it will keep on getting better.\\" Read on to see how Ridley makes his case. Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can... Question: Today, providing one hour's light costs _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"0.5 second's work\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"0.5 second's work.\\" In the article, science writer Matt Ridley explains that today, providing one hour's light costs only half a second's work. This is a significant improvement compared to the past. In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work, whereas in the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for, and in 1950, it was eight seconds.

The question seeks information on the founder of the Mormon Church, while the provided answer only discusses the church's values and practices of its members. A more valid and detailed answer to the question \\"Who Started the Mormon Church\\" would be: The Mormon Church, officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was founded by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York. Smith claimed to have been visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ in a vision during the spring of 1820, in which he was instructed to restore the original Christian Church, which had been lost over the years. In 1823, Joseph Smith said he was led by an angel named Moroni to a set of buried ancient golden plates containing sacred writings and records of the ancient inhabitants of America. Through divine guidance, Smith translated these plates into the Book of Mormon, which was published in 1830. The book is considered an additional volume of holy scripture for the LDS Church, alongside the Bible, and it provides the foundation for the church's teachings and doctrines. Following the publication of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith formally organized the Church of Christ, which eventually became the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As the church's first president and prophet, Smith led the members through a series of migrations and state conflicts, eventually settling in Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1844, Joseph Smith was murdered by an angry mob, causing a leadership crisis in the church. Brigham Young, a close associate of Smith and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, took on the traditional role of a prophet within the church, leading most members in the westward migration to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, where they established their headquarters. Overall, you should not validate the initial answer provided as it does not address the query of who founded the Mormon Church.

Frederick II of Prussia was again isolated. No help was to be expected from France, whose efforts at the time were centred on the Flanders campaign. Indeed, on 31 March 1745, before Frederick took the field, Louis XV and the Marshal of France Maurice de Saxe, commanding an army of 95,000 men, the largest force in the war, had marched down the Scheldt valley and besieged Tournay. Tournay was defended by a Dutch garrison of 7,000 soldiers. In May 1745, a British army under the command of the Duke of Cumberland attempted to break the French siege and relieve Tournay. Maurice had very good intelligence and knew the road that Cumberland was using to attack his forces besieging forces. Thus, Maurice could select the battlefield. Maurice chose to attack the British allied army on a plain on the east side of the Scheldt river about two miles southeast of Tournay near the town of Fontenoy. There the Battle of Fontenoy was fought on 11 May 1745. Fighting began at 5:00 AM with a French artillery barrage of the British-Allied forces, who were still attempting to move into their proper positions for their anticipated attack on Tournay. By noon, Cumberland's troops had ground to a halt and discipline had begun to dissolve. The British-Allied army sought cover in a retreat. It was a victory for the French that captured the attention of Europe because it overturned the mystique of British military superiority, and it pointed out the importance of artillery. On 20 June 1745, after the Battle on Fontenoy, the fortress of Tournay surrendered to the French. Answer this question: How many more men were part of the army of Louis VX than of Tournays?","completion":"In the given scenario, Louis XV and Marshal Maurice de Saxe commanded a French army of 95,000 men, while the fortress of Tournay was defended by a Dutch garrison of 7,000 soldiers. To find the difference in the number of men between these two forces, we simply subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 95,000 (French Army) - 7,000 (Tournay Garrison) = 88,000 Thus, the army of Louis VX had 88,000 more men than the forces defending Tournay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank prepares for the arrival of Inspector Tarconi (FranÃ§ois BerlÃ©and), his detective friend from France, who has come to spend his holiday in Florida with Frank. When Frank takes Jack for a medical checkup, he realizes barely in time that impostors have killed and replaced the doctor and receptionist. A lengthy fight erupts between villains, led by Lola (Kate Nauta), and the unarmed Frank; which results in the death of one of the fake doctors. Frank escapes with Jack. Just as they arrive at Jack's house, he receives a phone call. The caller informs him that he and Jack are in the sights of a sniper capable of penetrating the car's bulletproof glass.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bill O’Reilly wants to ‘beat up’ Mayor de Blasio for wanting to tax the rich Bill O’Reilly wants to sock it to Mayor de Blasio for picking on rich folks like him. The FOX News flamethrower threatened to pummel the liberal mayor on Thursday at a fundraiser for a Catholic parish. “I want to beat him up,” a worked-up O’Reilly said before a cheering crowd. O’Reilly was with fellow FOX franchise players Megyn Kelly and Brian Kilmeade at Long Island University’s Greenvale campus when his blood started boiling. What set off O’Reilly was a pre-selected question from the audience, Gawker reported. “Have we reached the point where there are more people on the free ride—for example, the people on the free ride getting welfare—than those who are actually working for a living?” Kilmeade read. It was like waving red in front of a bull. First O’Reilly launched into his regular guy resume about growing up in Levittown. “Today, a lot of Americans, you know, hey, gimme gimme gimme, you know, they’re not willing to pay the price to succeed,” he thundered. “It’s growing, I’m hoping we can reverse that, but it’s growing.” Then Kelly, who recently caused a stir by insisting Santa was white — and only white — chimed in with some boohooing about how de Blasio is trying to punish the wealthy by raising their taxes. “The thing is, you work so hard, and you finally start earning some money, and you have people like de Blasio telling you you’re not paying your fair share, that you’re somehow bad, that you need to pay more, and you haven’t earned it,” Kelly complained. That’s when O’Reilly, who like his FOX colleagues reportedly is paid a seven-figure salary, said he was ready to take on de Blasio. Hizzoner shrugged it off. “Stay classy, Bill,” his spokesman said. It’s not clear how O’Reilly would do in a fistfight with de Blasio. While O’Reilly fancies himself a tough guy, the 6-feet-5-inch mayor is an inch taller and a dozen years younger. Summary:","completion":"A news person named Bill O'Reilly said he wants to \\"beat up\\" a man named Mayor de Blasio because the mayor wants to make rich people pay more taxes. They were at an event with lots of people and some of them agreed with O'Reilly, but Mayor de Blasio's friend told them to \\"stay classy.\\" They didn't actually fight, but it's interesting that they are arguing about money and taxes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Memory: The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life. Whar does research show happens to blood glucorticoid levels during stressful events?","completion":"Research shows that during stressful events, blood glucocorticoid levels increase drastically. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are a class of steroid hormones that play a critical role in the body's response to stress. When an individual is exposed to stress, either short-term or long-term, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated. This activation leads to the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands, which then enter the bloodstream. The elevated blood glucocorticoid levels can be observed even after a short-term exposure to stress. The increase in these hormones serves as a means to mobilize energy resources, enhance alertness, and focus cognitive function in order to cope with the stressful situation effectively. However, this beneficial response can come with some detrimental consequences in both the short and long term. Elevated glucocorticoid levels can interfere with the function of the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays a vital role in learning and memory. This interference can lead to impaired memory formation and recall. Moreover, individuals exposed to stress may have difficulty completing learning tasks, further indicating the negative impact of increased blood glucocorticoid levels on cognitive function. Additionally, the article highlights that prenatal stress can also have adverse effects on the offspring's ability to learn and memorize. When the developing fetus is exposed to high levels of stress during pregnancy, this can disrupt the normal development of the hippocampus. Consequently, the offspring may experience impaired long-term potentiation, a process underlying learning and memory. Moreover, offspring from severely stressed parents may display increased levels of glucocorticoids in their blood when exposed to stress later in life, making them more vulnerable to the negative effects of stress on memory and learning. In summary, research demonstrates that blood glucocorticoid levels rise significantly during stressful events. This increase, although initially beneficial for coping with stress, can negatively impact memory and learning by interfering with hippocampal function. Furthermore, prenatal stress can have long-lasting consequences on the offspring by compromising hippocampal development and increasing their susceptibility to the detrimental cognitive effects of stress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Susan: I wanted to clarify whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already have agreements with ENA (and vice versa). As an example, I can only rely upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services agreement between ENA and ECT Canada. For book and tax purposes, the trade is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary. The Enron affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement). The credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal back to back transaction with the \\"booking\\" Enron affiliate) for which the \\"booking\\" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services agreement. Consider: ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth Bank of Australia?

Corr debuted in 1990 as the lead singer of the Celtic folk rock and pop rock group The Corrs along with her three elder siblings Caroline, Sharon, and Jim. Aside from singing lead vocals Corr plays the tin whistle, the ukulele, and the piano. Context: While her siblings were on hiatus to raise their families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, Ten Feet High, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, \\"Shame on You\\" was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may never see again. It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a \\"slick package\\" that was \\"polished, well produced and with a message that's difficult to ignore\\". Losing Today's David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr's vocals were \\"crisp and uplifting\\". Liverpool's Daily Post gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was \\"deceptively upbeat\\", which masked its \\"heavier message about conscription and war\\". On 10 April 2009 Andrea announced on Claudia Winkleman's BBC Radio 2 show that she would be releasing a second album of old songs and covers. She spoke of her disappointment and how 'gutted' she had been when her 2007 album Ten Feet High had failed to gain commercial success. She also spoke at length of her experiences while acting in the play Dancing at Lughnasa and how it has given her hope for upcoming projects, including a second solo album of 'old songs'. In late January 2011, her new album was announced for \\"early summer\\", and a downloadable MP3 of her cover of John Lennon's Number 9 Dream was made available to subscribers. Lifelines was released on 30 May. In the summer of 2012, she re-recorded the track \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" (which had first appeared on her album \\"Lifelines\\") with German electronic musician Christopher von Deylen, better known under his alias Schiller. It was released in Germany on 5 October on the Schiller album Sonne. Question: When did Corr launch her solo career?.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who made numerous amendments to the score of Rinaldo?, using the article: Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized..., what would be the answer ?

Let's solve the math problem together. We want to find out what 'j' is in the equation: -4543*j - 325104 = -375*j. 1. First, let's move the -375*j to the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 375*j to both sides: (-4543 + 375)*j - 325104 = 0 2. Now let's add the numbers inside the parentheses: (-4168)*j - 325104 = 0 3. Next, we want to get 'j' by itself. To do this, we will add 325104 to both sides of the equation: (-4168)*j = 325104 4. Finally, we want to figure out what number 'j' is. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -4168: j = 325104 / -4168 5. After we divide, we get: j = -78 So the answer is j = -78.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? can not disguise the slack complacency of ( godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence appears to be negative. Analyzing the sentence can help us understand the reasons behind this negative sentiment. Let's break it down and examine the various elements: 1. \\"cannot disguise\\" – this phrase implies that there is something that needs to be hidden or covered up, which could be seen as a negative aspect. 2. \\"slack complacency\\" – complacency refers to a state of being self-satisfied and unconcerned, while slack indicates a lack of effort or diligence. Combined, these words paint a negative image of the subject's attitude or approach. 3. \\"Godard's vision\\" – Godard is the person whose vision is being criticized. The mention of his vision brings attention to the idea that he is the creator of something, but in this context, it is being presented negatively due to the critique mentioned above. 4. \\"gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack\\" – the presence of the piano and strings suggests that there is at least some aspect of the work that is relatively positive, but this positive element is being contrasted with the following negative point. 5. \\"drown out\\" – this phrase means to cover up or overwhelm another sound, usually indicating that the sound being drowned out is less desirable than the one taking its place. In this context, it is another negative point. 6. \\"the tinny self-righteousness of his voice\\" – here, the subject's voice is described as \\"tinny,\\" which implies a weak and unimpressive sound, and \\"self-righteous,\\" which suggests that the subject may come across as arrogant, self-assured, or sanctimonious. Both of these attributes contribute to a negative impression of the subject's voice. Based on these elements, it becomes clear that the sentiment of the sentence is primarily negative. While there may be a small positive aspect mentioned (the gorgeous piano and strings), the overall tone of the sentence focuses on criticism and negativity. This type of language is likely intended to express disapproval or dissatisfaction with the subject's work or attitude."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The realm is ruled by the regal and articulate Queen Cassandra. Beautiful and wise, she is married to King Leonidas, a stern but just ruler, deeply in love with his queen. The kingdom is prosperous and merry under their reign until a prophecy is told that a great calamity will befall the kingdom that can only be fought by the King himself. However, the prophecy carries a sad caveat - the King may not return alive and victorious. Endearing herself to the prophesies more than anyone else in the kingdom, Queen Cassandra, though terrified, encourages King Leonidas to face the foretold calamity. A grand send-off is arranged for the king, filled with fireworks, music, and heartfelt goodbyes. The couple, known for their unbreakable bond, shares a moving, private bow.

This makes her even more loved and appreciated by the subjects. Still, her heart yearns for her husband, her nights echoed with his memories. In the wilderness, King Leonidas faces several tests, battling mystical creatures and enduring harsh conditions. Despite the longing for his queen and the warmth of his kingdom, he struggles steadfastly, knowing his people depend on his success. Back in Delphi, Queen Cassandra keenly awaits any news of Leonidas, her faith unwavering. She is aware of the heartache associated with the throne and how one must uphold their duty over personal interests, yet she cannot quell her innate fear. The plot twists when an unanticipated attack falls upon Delphi. The enemy expects to find a weakened kingdom due to the King's absence. However, they gravely underestimate Queen Cassandra and the unity of the Delphians. Led by Queen Cassandra, the people of Delphi bravely defend their realm. They manage to win this battle, their victory illuminating the essence of unity, leadership, and the strength of a woman who, despite bidding farewell to her beloved, stands firm and decisive. In the penultimate sequence, King Leonidas returns, having overcome the calamity and proven the prophecy untrue. He is overjoyed to see his kingdom intact and thriving under Queen Cassandra's rule. Their reunion is heartfelt, filled with admiration and love. The movie concludes by focusing on the power of perserverance and the faith Queen Cassandra had in both her husband and her people. It also encourages the discarding of archaic constructs regarding male-female roles, showing how effectively a queen can rule in the absence of a king. Queen Cassandra's choice to bid farewell to her husband, forcing her to grapple with her emotions, only resulted in her becoming stronger, driving the movie to its stirring climax and fulfilling ending. \\"The Queen's Farewell\\" is a movie of prophecy, love, separation, bravery, and victory, playing out in the mythical kingdom of Delphi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choices: [i] No; [ii] Yes;","completion":"[i] No, the suggested answer is not a valid response to the question. The question asks about ancient cultures that had marketplaces, while the answer provided describes a wall painting from Pompeii depicting a multigenerational banquet, which is unrelated to the topic of marketplaces. To more appropriately answer the question, several ancient cultures can be identified as having marketplaces. Here are some examples: 1. Ancient Mesopotamia: Marketplaces, known as \\"karums\\" or \\"tarmu,\\" played a central role in the economic activities of the various city-states in the region. Some famous examples include the markets of Sippar and Eshnunna. 2. Ancient Egypt: Marketplaces in Ancient Egypt, called \\"sebetu,\\" were places where goods and services were exchanged through a bartering system. Notable examples include markets in Thebes, Memphis, and Avaris. 3. Ancient Greece: In Ancient Greece, the \\"agora\\" (a central public space) served as the primary marketplace for goods, services, and even ideas. The most famous example is the Athenian agora, but similar marketplaces existed in many cities across the region. 4. Ancient Rome: Marketplaces, known as \\"macella\\" or \\"forum,\\" were a staple feature of Roman civilization. One of the most famous examples is the Roman Forum in the city of Rome, which housed markets, temples, and public buildings. Outside Rome, other Roman cities, such as Pompeii, also had marketplaces. 5. Ancient Mesoamerican cultures: The Aztecs, Mayans, and other ancient cultures in the Mesoamerican region had marketplaces referred to as \\"tianguis.\\" The Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan had one of the largest marketplaces in the ancient world, called Tlatelolco. 6. Ancient India: Ancient Indian civilizations, such as the Indus Valley Civilization and the Mauryan Empire, had marketplaces, known as \\"apana\\" or \\"shreni.\\" These markets centralized trade and commerce in the region, and their importance persisted through the Gupta Empire and into medieval India. These examples provide a more comprehensive and relevant answer to the question of which ancient cultures had marketplaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long. Paragraph: The story mentions that Avastin is associated with serious side effects, such as high blood pressure and internal bleeding; however, it did not provide data on how many women in each treatment arm experienced these side effects. The story briefly mentioned the two trials, RIBBON-1 and AVADO, on which the FDA will base their decision whether to revoke approval of the Avastin. The story could have mentioned that both were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and enrolled women with HER-2 neu negative tumors. It also would have been helpful if the reader knew that the women in the trials received another chemotherapy agent in combination with Avastin or a placebo. But a bigger issue is Claim: Looming ruling on breast cancer drug splits patient advocates","completion":"The claim states that a looming ruling on the breast cancer drug, Avastin, splits patient advocates. In support of this claim, the paragraph provides information on the drug's associated serious side effects, such as high blood pressure and internal bleeding, although specific data on the prevalence of these side effects is not given. Furthermore, the paragraph mentions two key trials, RIBBON-1 and AVADO, which will form the basis for the FDA's decision on whether to revoke approval for Avastin. These trials were double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled, and focused on women with HER-2 neu negative tumors. Additionally, the paragraph notes that the women involved in the trials received another chemotherapy agent alongside either Avastin or a placebo, suggesting that there may be differing opinions on the drug's safety and efficacy within the medical community. Considering the above information, the explanation for the claim that the looming ruling on Avastin splits patient advocates can be summarized as follows: The uncertainty regarding the drug's side effects, the trial outcomes, and the combination treatments may lead to divided opinions among patient advocates, with some supporting the drug's continued availability and others questioning its safety and efficacy, thus justifying the claim."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The last time Italy did not qualify for the FIFA World Cup was in 2017, during the qualification process for the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. This historic and unexpected failure marked the first time the Italian national football team, known as \\"Gli Azzurri\\" (The Blues), was unable to qualify for the World Cup since 1958. Italy found itself in a difficult qualification group, including powerhouse Spain. Both teams were favorites to advance to the World Cup, but only the top team from each group would automatically qualify, with the second-place team having another chance through a playoff. Spain topped the group by winning nine out of their ten matches, while Italy finished second with seven wins, two draws, and one loss - the latter being a crucial 3-0 defeat against Spain. As a result, Italy had to face Sweden in a two-leg playoff in November 2017 to determine the last European qualifier for the tournament. The first leg was played in Sweden, where Italy lost 1-0, with Jakob Johansson scoring the only goal. The second leg, in Italy, ended 0-0, meaning that Sweden advanced to the 2018 FIFA World Cup thanks to their single goal in the first match.

Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted. Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks.

In addition to being the ideal location for the given task, bowling alleys often have a casual and fun atmosphere that encourages social interaction among participants.

Additionally, these events often have restrictions on carrying or consuming alcohol in the playing area. In a croquet game (option D), the activity consists of hitting wooden or plastic balls with a mallet through hoops, not throwing spheres, so it does not match the description given in the question.

Greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account. On 1 January 2001, Greece joined the eurozone, with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1. However, in 2001 the euro only existed electronically, so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 January 2002.

Help as much as you can. Information: - Leeches are segmented worms that belong to the phylum Annelida and comprise the subclass Hirudinea. Like the oligochaetes, such as earthworms, leeches share a clitellum and are hermaphrodites. Nevertheless, they differ from the oligochaetes in significant ways. For example, leeches do not have bristles and the external segmentation of their bodies does not correspond with the internal segmentation of their organs. Their bodies are much more solid as the spaces in their coelom are dense with connective tissues. They also have two suckers, one at each end. - Euhirudinea, the true leeches, are an infraclass of the Hirudinea. These clitellate annelids are of somewhat unclear relationships; namely the relationships of Hirudinea with oligochaetes are in need of revision. It may be that the presumed sister taxon of the Euhirudinea, the Acanthobdellidea, turns out to be more distantly related, as was already the case with the Branchiobdellida. Thus, eventually Euhirudinea might become a junior synonym of Hirudinea. - The proboscisless leeches, Arhynchobdellida, are classified as an order of the Hirudinea. But leech taxonomy and systematics will eventually be revised in due time, not because there are many uncertainties about their phylogeny, but because the major clades of clitellate annelids - and whether the clitellates are themselves a clade - have not been fully elucidated. For example, the \\"true leeches\\" (Euhirudinea) might actually be synonymous with the Hirudinea, as all other leech-like annelids might not be very closely related to the true leeches. - Anatomy. Form and function. Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from long and wide to long and over wide, but the typical \\"Lumbricus terrestris\\" grows to about long. - In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes. Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes. In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the \\"female\\" or \\"male\\". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - The Hirudiniformes are one of the currently - accepted suborders of the proboscisless leeches ( Arhynchobdellida ) . Their most well - known member is the European Medical Leech , Hirudo medicinalis , and indeed most of the blood - sucking \`\` worms '' as which leeches are generally perceived belong to this group . In general , though some leeches suck blood , many are predators which hunt small invertebrates . The Arhynchobdellida were formerly divided into two groups , denoted by presence or absence of toothed jaws . But this does not represent a natural division , as has now been determined - the most primitive proboscisless leeches are not found among the jawed blood - sucking forms as was generally believed , but among the jawless predators . \`\` Jawed leeches '' - termed \`\` Gnathobdellae '' or \`\` Gnathobdellida '' - are exclusively found among the Hirudiniformes , but the order contains a number of jawless families as well . The jawed , toothed forms make up the aquatic Hirudidae and the terrestrial Haemadipsidae and Xerobdellidae ( sometimes included in the preceding but worthy of recognition as an independent family ) . These might actually form a clade , which would then be placed at superfamily rank , but it seems that the Hirudidae might rather be close relatives of the carnivorous Haemopidae instead . Many of the most well - known leeches belong to this family , most notably the medical leeches , such as the European species , already mentioned , which is prominent among these . Other medical Hirudiniformes of lesser importance are for example other species of the genus Hirudo , the North American Medical Leech ( Macrobdella decora ) , and the Asian Medical Leech ( Hirudinaria manillensis ) . Among the better - known bloodsucking land leeches are the Indian Leech ( Haemadipsa sylvestris ) and the yamabiru or Japanese Mountain Leech ( Haemadipsa zeylanica ) . - The clitellum is a thickened glandular and non-segmented section of the body wall near the head in earthworms and leeches, that secretes a viscid sac in which the eggs are deposited. It is present about behind the anterior end of the body (around the 14th, 15th and 16th segments). Its main function is to store the eggs of the worm. - The coelom (, plural coeloms or coelomata ) (from \\"koîlos\\", hollow, cavity) is the main body cavity in most animals and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs. In developed animals, it is lined with a mesodermal epithelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated. - Biological systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). Phylogenies have two components, branching order (showing group relationships) and branch length (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

Answer the following question: Process: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose tectonic plates crash with each other happens, how will it affect MORE or STRONGER earthquakes. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's first break down the perturbation hypothesis and analyze its potential effects on the process of earthquakes. Perturbation Hypothesis: If tectonic plates crash with each other, it may lead to more or stronger earthquakes. Step 1: More interaction between tectonic plates If tectonic plates crash with each other, it implies that there is more interaction between the plates. Increased interaction between the plates likely means an increase in the overall movement and force exerted by these plates. Step 2: Greater force exerted on the Earth's crust With the increased interaction between tectonic plates, the force exerted on the Earth's crust is likely to be greater as well. This would result in more significant stress being placed on the Earth's crust. Step 3: Increased likelihood of crust breaking As the stress on the Earth's crust increases due to the greater force exerted by the tectonic plates, the likelihood of the crust breaking also increases. This would result in more instances of the Earth's crust breaking apart. Step 4: More energy released With more instances of the Earth's crust breaking, there will be more releases of energy in the form of seismic waves. These releases of energy will cause more vibrations to move through the Earth. Step 5: More or stronger earthquakes experienced As more energy is released due to the increased interactions between tectonic plates, we would expect to feel more earthquakes, or potentially stronger earthquakes, as a consequence of these additional releases of energy. So, based on the analyzed perturbation hypothesis, it can be concluded that if tectonic plates crash with each other, they may cause more or stronger earthquakes. This implies that the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process of earthquakes through an increase in the interaction between tectonic plates, leading to greater forces being exerted on the Earth's crust and more energy being released."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solution:","completion":"1. Gather the necessary ingredients and tools: You will need potatoes (russets or Yukon golds work well), butter, milk or cream, salt, pepper, a potato masher or ricer, a pot, a colander, and a mixing bowl. 2. Prepare the potatoes: Wash the potatoes thoroughly under running water, and peel them if you prefer skinless mashed potatoes. Cut the potatoes into equal-sized 1-inch cubes to ensure even cooking. 3. Cook the potatoes: Fill the pot with enough water to cover the potatoes and place it on the stove over medium-high heat. Add a pinch of salt to the water. Once the water comes to a boil, carefully add the cubed potatoes. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook the potatoes for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender. 4. Drain the potatoes: Using the colander, carefully drain the cooked potatoes and let them sit for a minute to release excess steam and moisture. This step is crucial for avoiding mushy mashed potatoes. 5. Warm the milk/cream and melt the butter: Gently warm the milk or cream in a saucepan or in the microwave, and melt the butter. This step ensures a smooth and creamy texture for your mashed potatoes. 6. Mash the potatoes: Place the cooked and drained potatoes in a mixing bowl or back in the pot. Use the potato masher or ricer to mash the potatoes until they reach the desired consistency. Some people prefer smooth and creamy mashed potatoes, while others like them slightly lumpy. 7. Add the dairy and seasonings: Gradually pour the warmed milk or cream into the mashed potatoes, stirring well to incorporate. Add the melted butter, and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together until combined. 8. Serve the mashed potatoes: Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and enjoy them as a side dish with your favorite main course. You can garnish them with a sprinkle of chopped chives or parsley, or even a dollop of sour cream, if desired."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States.

Colonist Jack Winthrop (Edward Blatchford) tells Hawkeye that he is gathering volunteers to fight for the British army in hopes that their homes on the frontier will be guarded against Huron war party attacks, loyal to the French. He and a group of others leave the next morning for Albany in New York to obtain these terms of agreement from General Webb. Webb agrees to grant them leave if their homes are attacked. Satisfied, Winthrop and the others agree to lend their services in the militia and join the British forces at Fort William Henry, sixty miles north of Albany.Meanwhile, Cora Munroe (Madeleine Stowe) and her frail, younger sister Alice (Jodhi May), travel along a forest trail accompanied by a British garrison to see their father, Colonel Edmund Munroe (Maurice Roëves), having received notice to meet him there. The garrison is commanded by Major Duncan Howard (Steven Waddington) who is betrothed to Cora. Their route to Fort William Henry is led by a native guide named Magua (Wes Studi) who acts distant towards Duncan and expresses dissent towards the British in his native language, though Duncan is unaware that anything is amiss. Magua then, without reason, turns and walks toward the back of the formation and the garrison is suddenly ambushed by a Huron war party.

As Maid Marian has died and Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) is perpetually away battling in the Crusades, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. She has grown up to be a strong-willed young woman with a talent for archery, much like her father. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her. Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde). It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne â not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince). Though she does fortuitously cross paths with the prince, she is not aware of his identity for much of the film. With a romantic spark budding between them, they must find the Merry Men and join forces to free her father from the tortures of the Tower of London before the evil Prince John ascends to the throne and brings England to ruin. After freeing her father, Gwyn along with her father and Prince Philip stop the coronation of Prince John. In the end when Philip is about to be crowned as king, Gwyn with a heavy heart tells him that she can only serve and work for him and they cannot be together. Robin later explains that he stayed out of Gwyn's life to protect her from the life he leads, but it didn't make any difference because she grew up to be just like him anyway.

In the U.S., 33% of young mobile users have smartphones, with most young U.S. smartphone users (55%) being female. In other countries, most young smartphone users are male. 4. China and the U.S. have the most young users who use advanced mobile data services, with 84% of Chinese youth and 83% of U.S. youth using data beyond voice and text. 5. Mobile web usage is highest among Chinese youth (73%), with young American mobile users in second place at 48%. 6. U.S. teen texting shows they send or receive an average of 3,339 texts per month, an 8% increase from the previous year, with teen girls sending and receiving an average of 4,050 texts per month. 7. Payment for young people's cell phones varies by age and country. In the U.S., only 27% of mobile users aged 15-19 pay for their own service, whereas in Germany and Brazil, that number is 56%. 8. Once users reach the 20-24 age group, the percentage of users paying for their own mobile phone bills increases significantly, especially in Germany (84%) and Brazil (82%), while it is still relatively low in the U.S. (45%). 9. In terms of phone plans, a large majority of young mobile users in Russia (98%) have prepaid plans, while only 19% of U.S. young users do. However, prepaid plans are more common and diverse in most countries outside the U.S., suggesting that this trend might not be entirely age-related."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Agricultural experts met in Ethiopia last week to discuss ways to help sub-Saharan Africa become a major producer of wheat. The area traditionally produced little wheat, while North Africa was the grain basket. Wheat production fell sharply in sub-Saharan countries during the 1980s. In the 1960s, attempts were made to grow wheat in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat. Hans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer. He also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products. There are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets.

First, we have this math problem: -7432*a + 14336 = 7384*a - 14592*a Let's simplify the right side of the equation first. We have 7384*a - 14592*a. That is like saying we have 7384 apples and then we take away 14592 apples. 7384*a - 14592*a = -7208*a (So, we end up with -7208 apples.) Now our equation looks like this: -7432*a + 14336 = -7208*a Next, let's get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. We'll start by adding 7208*a to both sides. -7432*a + 7208*a + 14336 = -7208*a + 7208*a -224*a + 14336 = 0 Now let's move the numbers to the other side by subtracting 14336 from both sides. -224*a + 14336 - 14336 = -14336 -224*a = -14336 Finally, we need to find out what \\"a\\" is. To do that, let's divide both sides by -224. -224*a / -224 = -14336 / -224 a = 64 So there you go, little buddy! The solution to the math problem is a = 64.

However. Very few actuallv do it. Even the most consistent ones donate an average of just three to four times during their lifetime. Now the officials in Sweden are trying to change the trend with the help of modern-day technology. The encouragement to donate again begins shortly after the donor leaves the clinic when he/she receives a \\"thank you\\" text. Though that certainly helps them feel appreciated, what is even more pleasing is the text they receive each time their blood is used to help someone in need. Karolina Wiberg, manager of the Stockholm blood service, believes this small gesture not only results in repeat donors, but helps bring in new ones. The program that was started in Stockholm has received such positive feedback that it is now being rolled out across the country. However, Swedish officials are not stopping there. They are also encouraging local clinics to publish the exact levels of the different blood groups they have at any given time on their websites. This allows potential donors to realize that their blood can make a difference in saving someone ' s life. While all these outreach programs are great, busy citizens, even the ones with the best intentions have to be occasionally reminded. In order to jog their memories, officials ask people for authorization to send them text, Facebook, and e-mail reminders. Though that may sound disturbing, the citizens do not seem to mind, given that the messages are light-hearted and fun-things like \\"We won't give up until you bleed.\\" Though Sweden is currently the only country using modern technology to urge more donations, don't be surprised if more join in, especially if the Nordic country's blood banks start to overflow!

Step-by-step justification: 1. Acid rain makes waters acidic: Acid rain is caused by the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the air, which then dissolve in water droplets and fall to the Earth's surface as acidic precipitation. 2. Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil: The acidic water dissolves aluminum from the soil, which is toxic to many aquatic organisms. 3. The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc: The contaminated water carrying dissolved aluminum enters the aquatic ecosystems like lakes, rivers, and streams. 4. Fish and their eggs die: High levels of aluminum can be absorbed by fish, affecting their gills and causing suffocation. Aluminum can also be toxic to fish eggs, leading to high mortality rates and reduced reproduction. 5. Frogs and plants die: Aluminum toxicity can affect other aquatic organisms like amphibians (e.g., frogs) and aquatic plants, leading to their decline or death. 6. Insects and other wildlife die: Insects and other wildlife that depend on the fish, frogs, and plants for food and habitat also suffer, leading to a decline in their populations. 7.

Your best chance of doing this is to draw the attention of a passing plane. Body signals Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training, When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means, \\"yes\\". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means \\"no\\". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side. Smoke signals The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a tire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke. Ground-to-air signals It's a good idea lo build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols . If you can't find any wood, use earth. Some useful symbols are: F \\"I need food and water\\" II \\"I need medicine.\\" I \\"I am badly hurt.\\" X \\"I am unable lo move from here.\\" Pilots' replies If the pilot lowers the plane's wings from side to side, this means: \\"message received and understood\\" (At night, the pilot flashes the plane's green lights.) If the pilot flies the plane in a clockwise circle, this means \\"message received hut not understood\\" (At night, the: pilot flashes the plants red lights.) However, there is no signal which means \\"message not received.

Choose from: +yes. +no.","completion":"Yes, under the epidermis is the dermis, which is made of connective tissue, in other words, a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. This is the correct answer. The dermis is the second layer of the skin, below the surface epidermis. It is thicker than the epidermis and comprises two main regions: the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis. The papillary dermis is the thinner and more superficial region, located just beneath the epidermis. It consists of fine, interlacing collagen and elastic fibers that form a network. It houses blood capillaries and nerve endings that provide the skin with its sense of touch. This region also contains dermal papillae, which are finger-like projections that interlock with the epidermis, providing both nutrients and support. The reticular dermis, on the other hand, is the deeper and thicker region of the dermis, consisting of dense, irregular connective tissue. This layer is rich in collagen and elastin fibers, which give the skin its strength, elasticity, and flexibility. It also houses larger blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerve fibers, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. In addition to the functional characteristics mentioned above, the dermis also plays a crucial role in thermoregulation, immune response, and wound healing. In summary, under the epidermis is the dermis, which is made of connective tissue, in other words, a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. The dermis can be divided into two main regions: the papillary dermis and the reticular dermis, each with its unique structure and functions. The dermis is essential for providing structural support to the skin, housing various skin appendages, and facilitating essential skin functions such as sensation, thermoregulation, and immune response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: After the Sunset Context: After the Sunset begins with master thieves Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), retiring to Paradise Island in the Bahamas after one last big score, having lifted the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds. Their financial future is set, their career in crime a thing of the past. However, Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), the FBI agent who has spent seven years doggedly pursuing Burdett, only to be foiled time after time, refuses to believe their retreat into domesticity. After a few months, Lloyd shows up, accusing Burdett of hiding out in the same place where a cruise ship is displaying another large rare diamond, the third of a set of diamonds that he stole. He thinks the two are planning to lift the third Napoleon diamond, one of the three largest non-flawed diamonds in the world.When the two adversaries meet up in paradise, Burdett unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. Despite his pleas of innocence and placing Lloyd in first-class accommodations to show how he doesn't need to steal anything, Burdett's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts casing the ship. However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Mooré (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.Burdett pretends to work with Mooré, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan). Stan teams up with local police officer Sophie (Naomie Harris) to catch Burdett, and tails him to Junkanoo, a local parade, where Max loses him, warning that he shouldn't tail so closely.

Well, John Legend was right about one thing -- Kanye West's Grammys stunt was definitely something people were going to talk about. In fact, three days after the ceremony, it's still in the news. And Ryan Seacrest wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to ask the 37-year-old rapper about his motivations for briefly walking up on stage when Beck won Album of the Year. \\"You know, I felt like just the whole Grammys, right when that happened, everybody was looking at me and then people started screaming, 'Kanye! Kanye! Go do it!' Okay, that didn't really happen, these were voices in my head. So the voices in my head told me go and then I just walked up like halfway up the stage,\\" West told Seacrest during an interview on Wednesday. West continued, \\"You know, what I really wanted to do is just joke around about what had happened before, but I just really didn't want to take away from Beck's moment or the time he's having to talk because you know the Grammys, they play music really quick no matter who you are and everything. So I didn't want anything to take away from his screen time. So I just walked back down because you know, it was kind of a joke like the Grammys themselves.\\" The rapper also said his post-Grammy's tirade against the award show -- where West said Beck should \\"respect artistry\\" and give his award to Beyoncé -- was a mistake. \\"When I said that thing about respect artistry, I think it came off the wrong way, and that was a mis-wording on my part because obviously Beck is one the most respected artists and respects artistry,\\" he said. \\"But I felt that even though the Grammys sometimes gives awards to people who you wouldn’t think should win in the category, as a respect to artists, we mention the other artist's name in our speech. And that was the point I was making about it. There's like many of times I gave other people my award, literally made them come up onstage. Maroon 5, when they won best new artist, [Adam Levine] mentioned me because it was the College Dropout and [it had] 10 nominations and all that.\\" ||||| Kanye West has finally apologized for dissing Beck at the Grammys. “I would like to publicly apologize to Beck,” he posted to Twitter on Thursday night. “I’m sorry Beck.” After Beck won album of the year at this month’s Grammy Awards, West stormed the stage, a la his infamous 2009 stage-crashing moment with Taylor Swift, and then ranted to E! News that Beck did not deserve the award. “Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyoncé, and at this point, we tired of it,” West, 37, said at the time. “We ain’t gonna play with them no more.” Beck, 44, responded to the rant by simply stating, “You can’t please everybody, man. I still love him and think he’s genius. I aspire to do what he does.” Even though Beck had nothing but kind words for Kim Kardashian‘s husband, other celebrities weren’t so thrilled with the diss. “We should let [Kanye] choose who’s going to win the Academy Awards, so that we can put ourselves out of our misery of hearing him talk about the injustices that happen the next morning,” Bravo’s Andy Cohen said. Last week, West admitted during an interview with Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club” that he planned on calling Beck after the Grammy drama but never got around to it. “I got his number, I was supposed to call but I keep forgetting,” he said. While he was apologizing, West also threw out an “I’m sorry” to singer Bruno Mars because the rapper says he “used to hate on [Mars] but I really respect what he does as an artist.” ||||| In 2013, following the release of his last LP Yeezus, Kanye West was interviewed by BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe. West’s richly quotable pronouncements (“If you a Kanye West fan, you a fan of yourself”) inspired Jimmy Kimmel’s parody, which in turn prompted a furious West to fire an all-caps Twitter rant at the host. Back in London for the annual Brit awards — and a Nando’s chicken dinner — the mercurial entertainer stepped into Lowe’s studio once more. This time the agitated chest thumping was replaced by a tone of sombre reflection and displays of naked emotion – though there was plenty of outspokenness too. And, following the interview – in which Lowe had asked about West’s response to Beck’s Grammys win – the rapper took to Twitter to apologise for his behaviour at towards his fellow musician.“I would like to publicly apologize to Beck, I’m sorry Beck,” he wrote. He then followed that up by apologising to Bruno Mars, too – “I used to hate on him but I really respect what he does as an artist” – and inviting him to appear on a song with him. KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) I would like to publicly apologize to Beck, I’m sorry Beck. West kicked off his Radio 1 interview by speaking bitterly of not being treated properly as a designer until his recent collaboration with Adidas, and expressed a passion for fashion which runs deep: “People think that I pander to fashion. I believe that the world can only be saved through design. Art is to be free. Design is to fix.” The most jaw-dropping segment of the interview arrived when West wept as he recounted his friendship with Louise Wilson, the professor of fashion design at London art school Central Saint Martins who died last year. “Last time I saw her we had dinner,” Kanye explained, “she gave me some words of advice: ‘So many students don’t give it their all. The problem is, as soon as they do anything halfway good, when they’re two years old, three years old, their parents clap.’ And she just looked at me and she said, ‘Kanye. Don’t clap.’ I didn’t know we were gonna lose her.” At this point, West dissolved into tears before regaining his composure to admit: “That’s never happened to me in an interview before”. He shared some typically controversial views on class and race. “The class system is the new racism,” he opined. “Class is the new way to discriminate against people. To hold people down. To hold people in their place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make … I tweeted black lives matter, but all lives matter. My doorman is more important to me than the head of any company.” Lucky doorman. And there was more: “There’s still the word ‘exclusivity’ being thrown around,” he said. “Exclusivity is the new n-word, because nothing should be exclusive. Everybody should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain. The idea of exclusivity is the new coloured people fountain concept!” When questioned about his recent Beck-baiting conduct at the Grammys, West was unrepentant, and constructed an elaborate clock-based metaphor as his defence: “A broke clock is right twice a day, and the Grammys are so twice a day. What do you do those other times? If you had an assistant that could only give you the right time twice a day, at a certain point you’d want to fire that assistant. The Grammys are not the pinnacle, they’re an assistant. Us, as musicians, we’re the pinnacle. They’re an assistant, and they need to know what time it is.” He concluded: “The Grammy’s are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. As soon as you get in the car with ’em, you wanna go right back home.” As for new material, further details were scant. All West confirmed was that “This new album’s coming out of a fight to want to design. It’s a joyful noise unto the Lord. It’s still the struggle. But the beauty from the struggle.” Brit awards 2015: all the performances reviewed, from Kanye to Madonna Read more West also showed an unusually reflective side. He stopped short of apologising for his prior interview outbursts, but admitted that some of his behaviour may have had a negative effect: “I was using the wrong words. I was getting the drink thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. I’d think about the wild shit I’d say in interviews, and imagine if someone said this to a girl at a bar. ‘Yo what up baby I’m a genius’. It would be like, ‘Who’s this guy?’ I was looking at this girl, and I would stumble. I was like The 40 Year-Old Virgin. I did not know how to communicate. I had my point. My message was: ‘Your egg. My semen. We’re gonna change the world.’” He had some kind words for contemporary Drake: “I don’t have any advice for this young man, but what I say is: Run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don’t stop. [Let’s do] anything that we can do, to collectively deliver more awesomeness to the world, as a team.” West also admitted to being a hypocrite (“I’m human!”), before summing up his persona with a hint of the old Yeezy edge. “I can be vilified or misunderstood. I didn’t come here to be liked. I came here to make a difference. Everyone I meet I’m extremely nice [to]. But as soon as people start playing games, I stop [being nice]. At any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one.” ||||| UPDATE: Following a few more questions from Lowe about West's post-Grammy comments regarding Beck defeating Beyoncé for Album of the Year, Kanye publicly apologized to Beck via Twitter. \\"I would like to publicly apologize to Beck, I'm sorry Beck,\\" wrote West. His next tweets included an addidtional apology to Bruno Mars, because he \\"used to hate on him but I really respect what he does as an artist.\\" West even invited the singer to join him on a song produced by himself, Diddy and \\"No Church in the Wild\\" producer 88 Keys. In a wide-ranging, emotional interview with BBC's Zane Lowe, Kanye West showed a less frustrated and upset side of himself than his last interview with the DJ 18 months ago. Related: Influential DJ Zane Lowe Leaving BBC Radio 1 In 2013, West had been so heated about his frustrations with the fashion industry that dramatic quotes and mannerisms became the subject of spoofing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Lowe's new interview begins where they left off, with West explaining where he had been emotionally at the time. Filmed on Tuesday, the day before he debuted the energetic \\"All Day\\" live at the Brit Awards, West was more subdued than his last meeting with Lowe. \\"I was just myself and I expressed myself and I was gonna go for it,\\" said the rapper. Now finding a larger audience with fashion and design, West spoke more philosophically with Lowe. \\"I believe the world can only be saved through design,\\" he claimed, speaking about the topic in a more worldly sense and outside of just fashion. \\"Art is to be free. Design is to fix.\\" Classism in the fashion industry is still of concern to West, even as more doors are opening for him. He told Lowe that nothing should be exclusive and reiterated his idea that \\"classism is the new racism,\\" taking to task the \\"Black Lives Matter\\" slogan attached to recent injustices against young black men. \\"I know I tweeted 'Black Lives Matter,' but 'All Lives Matter,'\\" said West. While promoting \\"All Lives Matter,\\" West said he related to working-class people more than business executives. \\"My doorman is more important to me than any head of any company,\\" said West. \\"He keeps us safe. My driver keeps us safe and goes to work every day.\\" West cited many people in fields outside of music as his most recent inspirations. While discussing Louise Wilson, a British professor of fashion design who passed away last year, the rapper began openly weeping. \\"That's never happened to me in an interview before,\\" he said as soon as he composed himself. Engineer and entrepreneur Elon Musk also gets high praise from West, who details their conversations as discussions of \\"the futch,\\" short for future. Related: Hear Kanye's New Song with Sia, Vic Mensa West did provide some insight on his headspace for his new music, especially given the many recent releases and collaborations connected to projects from his upcoming album and otherwise. \\"It's fun to work hard. We're being inventive,\\" notes West on what to expect form the new music. \\"The College Dropout came out of a fight to rap. This new album is coming out of a fight to design.\\" He later compares the new material to the hymnal \\"Amazing Grace,\\" stating its focus on \\"the beauty of the struggle.\\" Lowe presses West to discuss working with \\"Only One\\" and \\"FourFiveSeconds\\" collaborator Paul McCartney specifically, and West spoke with reverence about the former Beatle. \\"Meeting Paul McCartney was like meeting Ralph Lauren,\\" he states. \\"[They are] the greatest of their fields. Period. Of all time.\\" Working with McCartney was a great learning experience for West, musically. \\"The types of chord changes that Paul does...I don't even understand them,\\" he said. \\"That's because he invented them,\\" added Lowe. West continued \\"To be able to be involved with writing a song like that is way next [level].\\" He notes that on \\"FourFiveSeconds\\" the cadence is trap above the \\"Seventies FM radio\\" sound that Lowe pointed out. West also confirmed that a video with Drake and Big Sean for Sean's single \\"Blessings\\" is forthcoming, calling both \\"two of the hottest rappers in the game.\\" West focuses on Drake specifically as the hottest rapper. \\"I'm the visual extension of what he's doing sonically,\\" he claims, noting that his performances have had a similar effect on audiences as the recent surprise mixtape from Drake. He adds: \\"I don't have any advice for that young man. What I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can.

The rapper, whose wife’s family has been feuding lately with his ex Amber Rose, took a major dig at the stripper-turned-model during an interview with Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club” on Friday morning. “It’s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that’s with Amber Rose — I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim,” he quipped. West, 37, was also quick to brush off Rose’s recent inflammatory comments about Kardashian. “She’s just soaking in the moment,” the “Wolves” rapper said about Rose. “Don’t nobody feel compelled to do nothing. If Kim had like dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there wouldn’t be an Amber Rose.” Rose, 31, raised eyebrows when she slammed Kardashian, 34, and her 17-year-old sister Kylie Jenner during an interview on Monday’s “Breakfast Club,” calling Mrs. West “fake” and claiming Jenner came between 25-year-old rapper Tyga and Rose’s pal Blac Chyna. “She has potential to be, like, really dope, but to me she’s not,” Rose said about Kardashian. “It doesn’t have to do with Kanye. They are a match made in heaven, for sure.” On Friday afternoon, Rose fired back at West via Twitter, writing: “Wait 30 showers? But Kim let RayJ n– on her…. Never mind,” explicitly referring to Kardashian’s infamous sex tape with Ray J. West also couldn’t dodge questions about whether Tyga and Jenner are a couple. With major pause and hesitation, West said, “I think that … ugh … I think that he got in early. I think he was smart.” Tyga adamantly denied dating Jenner during an interview on Tuesday. “I’m not dating that, so I just wanna get that out the way. I wanna be clear to everybody that I didn’t leave my family to be with Kylie, you know what I mean? That’s ridiculous.” Rose claimed that Tyga left Chyna and the couple’s young child for Jenner last August. When the subject of West’s infamous Grammy stage-storming stunt before Beck’s album-of-the-year acceptance speech, and his subsequent slam about Beck’s “artistry,” arose, West admitted he hadn’t even listened to the album before all the awards show drama. He finally heard some of Beck’s album over dinner with Taylor Swift recently and said, “Man, this is kinda good!” He also planned on calling Beck after the fiasco but never did. “I got his number, I was supposed to call but I keep forgetting.” ||||| Want to know more about Breakfast Club?

He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\". The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's \\"March on Rome\\" of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (state commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler. On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Burgerbraukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with handgun drawn, demanded and got the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the army, nor the state police, joined forces with Hitler. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide. He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison. While at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office. Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.

Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally. Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls. Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow. Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a bergschrund. Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why do marginal crevasses form on the edge of a glacier?","completion":"Marginal crevasses form on the edge of a glacier primarily due to the differences in speed and friction between the center and the edges of the glacier as it moves through a valley or across a slope. To understand why marginal crevasses form, it is necessary to explore the mechanics of glacier movement and the forces acting on the ice. Glaciers move through a combination of processes, including internal deformation, sliding at the base, and regelation (the melting and refreezing of ice). The movement of glaciers is influenced by various factors such as gravity, slope, and the underlying bedrock or terrain. One crucial aspect is the way glacier ice interacts with the valley walls or any confining barriers. At the center of a glacier, the ice flows with relatively little friction, as it does not come into contact with the valley walls or other confining features. This allows the central portion of the glacier to move faster, with less resistance. On the other hand, the edges of a glacier are in contact with the valley walls or any other confining barriers. The friction between the ice and these boundaries slows down the movement of the ice at the glacier's margins. Consequently, the difference in speed between the faster-flowing center and the slower-moving edges creates tension in the ice. This tension leads to the formation of marginal crevasses, which are predominantly transverse to the flow, as the ice at the margins of the glacier tries to keep pace with the ice in the center. The resulting stress causes the ice to fracture and crack, creating these characteristic crevasses at the edge of the glacier. In summary, marginal crevasses form on the edge of a glacier due to the difference in speed caused by friction of the valley walls or other constraints. The tension resulting from the varying movement rates leads to the formation of these crevasses, providing insight into the mechanics of a glacier and highlighting the complex forces at play in its movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks. Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has \\"always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.\\" He added: \\"And I am not going anywhere.\\" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of \\"smear campaign\\" against him.

Hide Caption 12 of 12 The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back Melgen 58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \\"oversight.\\" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor. Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012 , Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \\"don't want to live by.\\" \\"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\\" the senator said. \\"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\\" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic , and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \\"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\\" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. \\"The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,\\" the appeals court said. \\"These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging that he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts.

Lieutenant Steklov, son of a high-ranking General, is assigned to Afghanistan, hoping to take part in combat and earn some medals before the war ends. Sgt. Arsionov (Aleksei Serebryakov) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal hazing of young conscripts back on the field base. Major Bandura\`s tour of duty has expired. He is free to go home and reunite with his wife whom he has almost forgot. This means leaving his mistress Katya (Tatyana Dogileva), a nurse in the base's hospitalâto a much anticipation from Bandura's superior Leonid (Mikhail Zhygalov) who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the Perestroika. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives. The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan warlord that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the mujahedin. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village. When the preparations are finished, Bandura comes to say good bye to Katya, who is scheduled to leave the country...

Properly Closing Firefox Now that you know the drawbacks of using the close button, let's look at the correct steps to close Firefox and avoid those issues: 1. Open the \\"File\\" menu, or Firefox Menu Depending on the version of Firefox you are using, the menu can either be accessed by clicking on the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) located in the upper right corner or the \\"File\\" option in the top-left corner of the browser window. 2. Select \\"Quit Firefox\\" Once you have opened the menu, look for the option labeled \\"Quit Firefox\\" (or \\"Exit\\" in some versions). Clicking on this option will trigger the proper closing procedure for the browser, which involves shutting down all active processes and saving your data. This step should help you avoid the issues mentioned above. Note: Mac users will find the \\"Quit Firefox\\" option under the \\"Firefox\\" menu located on the top-left corner of the screen, next to the Apple logo.

This practice will help you avoid data loss in case of unexpected browser crashes or power outages. 2. Update Regularly: Keep your Firefox browser up to date with the latest patches and security updates. Regularly updating your browser will ensure optimal performance and help protect you from potential threats. 3. Use Extensions Wisely: Make sure to install only trusted extensions from the official Firefox addon repository, as malicious extensions can compromise your browser's security and performance. 4. Manage Your Privacy Settings: Take the time to review and adjust the privacy settings in Firefox according to your preferences. This action will help protect your personal information and browsing habits from potential tracking or data misuse. Conclusion In conclusion, knowing how to close the Firefox browser properly is an essential skill for maintaining a secure and efficient browsing experience.

Answer the following question: Given the background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. and the situation: John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Answer the following question: Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's go through the information and steps involved: 1. Background information provided states that when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. This is because particles of reactants have more energy at higher temperatures, which causes them to move faster and collide with greater force. 2. John conducts two tests - Test A and Test B. In Test A, he warms up the reactants, while in Test B, he cools down the reactants. Now, we can compare the energy of particles in Test A and Test B based on the given information. Since Test A involves warming up the reactants, it means the temperature of the reactants is higher as compared to Test B. According to the background information, at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy.

The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy. Answer:","completion":"The state that claimed their independence on 5 October 1908 is Bulgaria. The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia, proclaiming itself an independent state on that date."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (1). unacceptable; (2). acceptable;...I think the answer is","completion":"To determine whether a linguist would rate this sentence acceptable linguistically, let's analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the sentence structure and components. - The sentence contains a subject (\\"That John was elected\\"), verb (\\"surprised\\"), and object (\\"Frank\\"). Step 2: Analyze the subject. - \\"That John was elected\\" is a dependent clause (also known as a nominal clause) acting as the subject in the sentence. Dependent clauses often begin with words like \\"that,\\" \\"which,\\" or \\"who\\" and provide extra information about something mentioned earlier in the sentence. Step 3: Analyze the verb. - \\"Surprised\\" is a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object to complete its meaning. In this sentence, it correctly pairs with the object, \\"Frank.\\" Step 4: Analyze the object. - \\"Frank\\" is a proper noun, and it works as the object of the verb \\"surprised,\\" which indicates who is surprised by the event mentioned in the subject. Step 5: Check the sentence's overall coherence and meaning. - The sentence expresses a complete thought, and the subject, verb, and object all work together to convey that Frank is surprised by John's election.

United States Postal Service, 546 U.S. 481 (2006), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, involving the extent to which the United States Postal Service has sovereign immunity from lawsuits brought by private individuals under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Court ruled that an exception to the FTCA that barred liability for the \\"negligent transmission of mail\\" did not apply to a claim for injuries caused when someone tripped over mail left by a USPS employee. Instead, the exception only applied to damage caused to the mail itself or that resulted from its loss or delay. Context_2 : During the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases. In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice. Notable cases include \\"United States v. Cruikshank\\" (1875), \\"United States v. Reese\\" (1875), \\"Reynolds v. United States\\" (1878), \\"Wilkerson v. Utah\\" (1879), the \\"Trade-Mark Cases\\" (1879), \\"Strauder v. West Virginia\\" (1880), \\"Pace v. Alabama\\" (1883), \\"United States v.

Kagama\\" (1886), \\"Ker v. Illinois\\" (1886), and \\"Mugler v. Kansas\\" (1887). Context_3 : On April 28, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" (Ohio), which was consolidated with three other same-sex marriage cases from the other states in the Sixth Circuit: \\"Tanco v. Haslam\\" (Tennessee), \\"DeBoer v. Snyder\\" (Michigan), \\"Bourke v. Beshear\\" (Kentucky). On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, paving the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in those states, and setting a precedent for the entire nation. All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued. Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states' ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal. The Sixth Circuit consists of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit. On November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit in a split 2-1 decision, upheld the states' same-sex marriage bans, reversing the district courts' rulings that struck them down. The Sixth Circuit was the first and only circuit court since the landmark ruling \\"United States v. Windsor\\" to uphold the constitutionality of states' same-sex marriage bans which caused a circuit split. Context_4 : Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994) , more commonly Dolan v. Tigard, was a United States Supreme Court case. It was a landmark case regarding the practice of zoning and property rights, and served to establish limits on the ability of cities and other government agencies, to use zoning and land-use regulations to compel property owners to make unrelated public improvements. Context_5 : Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), was a case regarding the protections offered by the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution. In the case, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the privileges and immunities of the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause enjoyed by members of Congress also extend to Congressional aides, but not to activity outside the legislative process. Context_6 : BedRoc Limited, LLC v. United States, 541 U.S. 176 (2004) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided sand and gravel are not \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the United States Government under the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919. The Court sided in a 6–3 decision with the petitioner, BedRoc Limited, and reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court. BedRoc Limited had removed sand and gravel from lands obtained under the Pittman Act, and the United States, the respondent, argued those were reserved to the U.S. Government under that law. Context_7 : Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, \\"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\\" As far back as the circuit court ruling in \\"Corfield v. Coryell,\\" 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In \\"Paul v. Virginia,\\" 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as \\"right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\\" However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as \\"Ward v. Maryland,\\" 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the \\"Slaughter-House Cases,\\" 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and \\"United States v. Harris,\\" 106 U.S. 629 (1883). Context_8 : Delta Groove Productions is an American blues record label in Van Nuys, California, United States. The label was founded by Randy Chortkoff, a producer, concert promoter, and harmonica player who died in May 2015 while awaiting a liver transplant and sentencing on multiple criminal felony fraud charges including bilking investors of over 1,400,000 in a phony movie investment scam. In 2016, Chortkoff's co-defendant Sam Braslau was sentenced to seven years in federal prison in Lompoc, California. Co-defendant Stuart Rawitt previously pled guilty and was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison. Both co-defendants were ordered by the US Court to pay restitution of 1,600,000.

Context_10 : The Legal Tender Cases were a series of United States Supreme Court cases in the latter part of the nineteenth century that affirmed the constitutionality of paper money. In the 1869 case of \\"Hepburn v. Griswold\\", the Court had held that declaring paper notes to be legal tender in payment of debts existing prior to the Legal Tender Act of 1862 violated the United States Constitution.

Read this: The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work being done, largely within the framework of scholastic commentaries on Aristotle's scientific writings. William of Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony: natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object and an intermediary \\"sensible species\\" is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye. Scholars such as Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia. The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.

Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What formal dance has a tradition of female students asking the male students to the dance? A:","completion":"The formal dance that has a tradition of female students asking the male students to the dance is known as the Sadie Hawkins Dance. This distinctive event has its roots in American popular culture and plays a role in breaking traditional gender norms. The concept of the Sadie Hawkins Dance dates back to November 15, 1937, when it was introduced by cartoonist Al Capp in his famous comic strip, Li'l Abner. The story took place in the fictional town of Dogpatch, and the dance was created as a subplot within the comic strip series. Sadie Hawkins was an unmarried and not-so-attractive lady who struggled to find a suitable partner. Consequently, her father, Hekzebiah Hawkins, created a special event called the \\"Sadie Hawkins Day,\\" wherein all eligible bachelors in town had to participate in a footrace. Sadie would chase the runners, and whoever she caught would have to marry her. This quirky idea gained immense popularity, and by 1939, high schools and colleges across the United States started hosting their own annual Sadie Hawkins Dances. These events were an opportunity for young women to break societal conventions, exercise a degree of autonomy, and be active participants in initiating social relationships. The Sadie Hawkins Dance is distinct from regular school dances in that it has an informal atmosphere, often with laid-back themes and decorations. At times, schools conducting these events might have certain dress codes like \\"country-themed attire\\" or \\"casual outfits\\" to create a casual ambiance. This dance event has played a significant role in challenging traditional gender roles and promoting gender equality in social settings. Females asking males to the dance is not only empowering but also provides a sense of exuberance and control for young women who otherwise might feel pressured or hesitant in such situations. Though the Sadie Hawkins Dance might not be as popular as it was in the past, it still serves as an essential reminder of the importance of challenging societal norms in order to foster an inclusive environment, equality between genders, and an overall sense of camaraderie."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Quinn spent a lot of time with the Kai family with which they were staying in America.

The pollen was giving Adam a runny nose but not Randy, as Pick your answer from: * Adam is sensitive to tree pollen. * Randy is sensitive to tree pollen.","completion":"The pollen was giving Adam a runny nose but not Randy, as Adam is sensitive to tree pollen. Adam's sensitivity to tree pollen is caused by an allergic reaction in which his immune system perceives pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response that manifests in symptoms such as a runny nose. Pollen allergies, also known as \\"hay fever\\" or \\"allergic rhinitis,\\" are quite common and affect millions of people worldwide, particularly during the spring and summer months when trees, plants, and grasses release large amounts of pollen into the air. When Adam inhales tree pollen, his immune system overreacts by releasing histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and irritation in his nasal passages. This reaction leads to many uncomfortable symptoms, including nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes, headache, and fatigue. In some cases, breathing difficulties and asthma attacks may also occur as a result of allergic reactions to pollen. On the other hand, Randy does not experience similar symptoms because he is not sensitive to tree pollen. His immune system does not perceive these particles as a threat, and he is able to inhale pollen without experiencing the same discomfort as Adam. However, it's important to note that Randy may still be sensitive to other allergens, such as pet dander, mold, or dust mites, and could experience allergic symptoms as a result of exposure to those substances. Two people can react differently to the same environmental allergen due to various reasons. Genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in determining an individual's immune responses and susceptibility to allergies. For example, if Adam's parents have allergies, it's more likely he would develop sensitivities to allergens as well. Moreover, the level of exposure to certain allergens during childhood can also influence the development of allergies. Studies have shown that early exposure to allergens can reduce the risk of developing sensitivities later on in life. In Randy's case, he may have been exposed to tree pollen during childhood, allowing his immune system to build a tolerance towards it effectively. In conclusion, the pollen was giving Adam a runny nose but not Randy because Adam is sensitive to tree pollen. His allergic reaction is the result of an overactive immune system response to pollen particles, causing inflammation and irritation in his nasal passages. Meanwhile, Randy does not exhibit symptoms of a pollen allergy, thanks to the unique differences in his immune system, genetic factors, and personal exposure to allergens over his lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: toilet tissue Possible answers: +can cover hands when wiping poop; +can cover press conferences when wiping poop;","completion":"Toilet tissue, a sanitary paper product commonly used to maintain personal hygiene after defecation, has various practical uses. Among the provided options, the most appropriate use for toilet tissue is to cover hands when wiping fecal matter after the user goes to the bathroom. In this answer, I will discuss the step-by-step process of using toilet tissue effectively to ensure proper hygiene while minimizing direct contact with feces. 1. Preparing the toilet tissue: Unroll a sufficient amount of toilet paper to cover the surface of your hand. This will prevent direct contact with fecal matter during the wiping process. Generally, 3-4 squares of toilet tissue folded or layered together would suffice, but personal preferences may vary. 2. Positioning toilet tissue: Place the folded toilet tissue in the palm of your dominant hand (right hand for right-handed individuals and vice versa). Ensure that your fingers are wholly covered by the toilet tissue so that there is no direct contact with fecal matter. 3. Wiping process: Begin wiping the perianal area, moving from front to back, with gentle but firm pressure. Be cautious not to rub the area too aggressively or press too hard, as this may lead to irritation of the sensitive skin in the perianal region. 4. Inspection: Quickly examine the used toilet tissue after each wipe to monitor the cleanliness of the area and the amount of fecal matter removed. Repeat the wiping process until there is minimal to no fecal matter present on the toilet tissue. 5. Disposing of used toilet tissue: Once the perianal area is clean, dispose of the used toilet tissue into the toilet bowl and flush properly. If using a bidet, toilet tissue can be used to pat dry the area after rinsing. 6. Washing hands: Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water immediately after using toilet tissue, regardless of whether there was direct contact with fecal matter. Handwashing is essential to eliminate any potential fecal contamination and maintain personal hygiene. Note that using toilet tissue to cover press conferences is not relevant, sanitary, or practical. Toilet tissue is specifically designed to maintain personal hygiene and cleanliness by wiping away fecal matter or urine after using the toilet, and should not be employed for unrelated purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 3: Analyze and justify whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise. - The premise does indicate that a man is washing something, potentially clothes, in a street fountain. This matches part of the hypothesis. - However, there is no specific information regarding the man's living situation or him being homeless. - To derive the hypothesis from the premise, additional information or context would be needed to connect the man to homelessness.

Sentence 2: That man is not worth as much as he thinks he is. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(C). No Let's dive deeper into both sentences to understand why option (C) is the correct answer. Sentence 1: 'Irritatingly, that man is certainly worth his ego.' This sentence implies that the man has a strong ego and that his worth matches his ego. The adverb \\"irritatingly\\" expresses an annoyance related to the realization that his ego and worth are justified or deserved because they are equal. In other words, he is fully aware of his ego and has every right to feel that way due to his genuine worth. Sentence 2: That man is not worth as much as he thinks he is. This sentence suggests that despite the man's inflated ego or self-worth, his actual worth is less than what he perceives or projects. It indicates an overestimation of his capabilities and worth in comparison to reality. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these sentences. If sentence 1 is true, it suggests that the man's ego is justified, meaning his worth is on par with his perception of self-worth or the high esteem he holds himself in. Therefore, sentence 2 cannot be true at the same time since it states that his actual worth falls short of his ego or self-perception. In conclusion, the correct response to the relationship between these two sentences is option (C). No, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true, as they contradict each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He used fire escape to break into a Congress Street flower shop thinking it was his friend's building. Podlaski fell from second-floor window after tripping alarm and stumbling.

Article:","completion":"Title: Prankster Ends Up in Jail After Mistaken Break-in into Flower Shop Portland, Maine - A 29-year-old man named Ronald Podlaski, who goes by the online moniker RookSye, found himself behind bars last weekend, after a failed prank led to him mistakenly breaking into a Congress Street flower shop. Initially charged with burglary and criminal mischief, prosecutors eventually decided to drop the charges against him. Podlaski was under the impression that he was breaking into his friend's building using a fire escape while they were away in El Salvador on Saturday. However, his friend was actually away while visiting El Salvador and, unbeknownst to him, his prank would have failed in any case. Upon breaking into the flower shop, Ronald tripped the alarm system and stumbled in the process, causing him to fall from the second-floor window and subsequently landing him in jail for the weekend. Fortunately for Podlaski, the legal repercussions of his poorly executed prank were minimized, as prosecutors opted to make the decision to not pursue charges of burglary and criminal mischief against him, taking into account that his intentions were not to commit a crime, but rather partake in an ill-fated jest. This incident serves as a reminder to others that pranks can have serious consequences, both legally and physically. However, in the case of Ronald Podlaski, the end result was a weekend spent in a Portland jail, rather than facing significant charges for an ill-conceived and poorly executed practical joke."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases.

But whatever it is, it's not gonna stay where it is.\\"Rubin encouraged a \\"back to basics\\" approach and wanted the group to bring finished songs to the studio.

Both punishments carry severe consequences, but they differ greatly in their nature and implementation.

The air above which burner is warmer? Hint: Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes. Answer:","completion":"The air above burner B is warmer. To understand why, let's first define the given information and explore the concept of temperature and pressure differences in relation to air movement and weather phenomena. In Steve's kitchen, there are two burners: 1. Burner A is not turned on, which means it is currently at room temperature and not actively generating heat. 2. Burner B is set to \\"medium,\\" which indicates it is currently producing heat. From the hint provided, we know that surface temperature differences cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it, causing the air to expand and lower its density. This results in decreased surface air pressure. This phenomenon is due to the fact that when air molecules are heated, they move faster and spread out. Hence, the air expands and becomes lighter, creating a low-pressure area. The horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from regions of higher pressure (cooler air) to lower pressure (warmer air). This causes wind formation, and due to the Earth's rotation, the Coriolis effect comes into play, deflecting the airflow. Although the hint provided refers to more significant weather phenomena, such as the Hadley cell and coastal breezes, this concept can also be applied to the scenario in Steve's kitchen. Because burner B is set to \\"medium\\" and actively producing heat, the air above it will be warmer than the air above burner A, which is not turned on. Burner B's heat warms the air above it, causing it to expand, which decreases air density and surface air pressure. On the other hand, burner A is at room temperature and not generating heat, leaving the air above it cooler and denser, with higher air pressure. In conclusion, the air above burner B will be warmer due to the heat it is generating, which leads to the reported phenomena of pressure differences and potential air movement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: hopeful and regretful B: angry at Jordan C: pleased with Jordan The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: pleased with Jordan Given the context, it is clear that Jordan is making an effort to resolve any issues or misunderstandings that may have occurred between the two of you. By taking you out to eat, they are demonstrating a willingness to make amends and repair the relationship. As a result, most people would feel pleased with Jordan's actions, recognizing the attempt to improve the situation. Option A, which mentions feelings of hopefulness and regret, might be applicable to people who were directly involved in the disagreement. However, it would not apply to everyone's feelings as a whole. For instance, others might only observe the outcome and their feelings about the relationship but not about the disagreement itself. In this case, their feelings would most likely be limited to the actions being taken to mend the situation, rather than dwelling on the past. Option B, which suggests people would be angry at Jordan, is not an accurate reflection of the situation in context.

As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson. Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water. In which case the solute would be less soluble, case C or case D?","completion":"To determine in which case the solute would be less soluble between case C and case D, let's analyze the differences between these two tests step-by-step: 1. In Test C, Keith used a gaseous solute in a solvent at room temperature. 2. In Test D, Keith used the same gaseous solute in the same solvent but increased the temperature. Now, as mentioned in the given information, solubility of gaseous solutes generally decreases at higher temperatures. Comparing Test C and Test D, the only difference is the increase in temperature for Test D. Therefore, the solute would be less soluble in case D compared to case C because of the higher temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The incident occurred at Mina, a tent city situated just a few miles east of Mecca, and is considered to be one of the worst disasters to occur during the hajj pilgrimage in recent history. In this article, we will look at the reasons behind the stampede, the responses and actions taken by the authorities, and the impact that the incident has had on the global Muslim community. The hajj pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and a religious obligation that every Muslim who is physically and financially capable must fulfill at least once in their lifetime. Each year, millions of Muslims from around the world gather in Mecca and its surrounding areas to participate in a series of rituals and prayers. The dense crowds and high temperatures make the hajj pilgrimage a challenging and arduous experience. Nevertheless, the event is often seen as one of unity, peace, and profound spiritual importance to Muslims worldwide. The tragic stampede occurred during the final days of the hajj pilgrimage when thousands of worshippers were moving toward the Jamarat Bridge to take part in the symbolic stoning of the devil, a pivotal and mandatory ritual that marks the end of the spiritual journey. As the crowd of pilgrims rushed to perform the rite, many tripped and fell, causing a massive commotion. The combination of high temperatures, insufficient crowd control, and panicked pilgrims resulted in chaos and the subsequent tragedy. In the aftermath of the incident, the Saudi authorities conducted an investigation, which revealed that the deadly stampede was caused by a series of factors, including unruly and undisciplined pilgrims, a lack of necessary infrastructure, and an insufficient capacity to manage the vast influx of worshippers. Amid the chaos, fingers were pointed at the Saudi government, with critics accusing them of negligence and mismanagement. In response, the Kingdom vowed to improve safety measures during the hajj pilgrimage and announced the allocation of additional funds and resources for this purpose. The disaster near Mecca generated an outpouring of grief and shock from the global Muslim community. Emergency medical workers rushed to the scene to treat the injured, while local hospitals were overwhelmed with an influx of patients. Many countries, including Iran, India, and Pakistan, reported that their citizens were among the dead and injured. Leaders from around the world sent condolences and expressed their deep sadness over the tragedy that had befallen the hajj pilgrims. In response to the shocking death toll, governments urged Saudi Arabia to improve the safety and security of the pilgrims in the future. The devastating stampede near the Saudi holy city of Mecca has brought to light the importance of addressing the growing challenges and risks associated with hosting one of the world's largest religious gatherings. As the number of Muslims worldwide continues to increase, the hajj pilgrimage is expected to attract even more participants in the coming years. Consequently, it is essential that the Saudi Arabian government, along with the international Muslim community, work together to establish comprehensive regulations, safety protocols, and crowd management strategies to prevent further tragedies and ensure that the annual hajj pilgrimage remains a source of unity, peace, and profound spiritual reflection for millions of individuals across the globe."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer? is inside the article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it.

What is the best way to: Make a neat trash container for your car. Options are: [a]. A plastic cereal container with a bag in it makes a neat car trash container. [b]. Wrap a plastic bag around your gear shifter for a neat trash can in the car. Answer:","completion":"The best way to make a neat trash container for your car is option [a]: A plastic cereal container with a bag in it makes a neat car trash container. This solution is not only more practical but also more aesthetically pleasing than option [b]. There are several reasons why a plastic cereal container with a bag in it is the better option: 1. Size and capacity: A plastic cereal container typically has a suitable size and capacity for holding trash in a car. It is not too big to take up much-needed space nor too small to require constant emptying. On the other hand, wrapping a plastic bag around the gear shifter may not provide enough space for trash and become a hassle to use. 2. Stability: A cereal container has a flat base, which provides stability when placed on the floor of the car or in a cup holder. This ensures that the container will not tip over and spill its contents. A plastic bag wrapped around the gear shifter is prone to swinging and may not securely hold the trash. 3. Ease of use: A cereal container with a bag lining usually has a flip-top or snap-on lid, making it easy to open and close while driving. This design minimizes spillage and keeps odors contained. In contrast, a plastic bag wrapped around the gear shifter may not seal properly, and accessing it while driving could be inconvenient and unsafe. 4. Aesthetics: A plastic cereal container tends to look better and more organized in a car than a plastic bag wrapped around the gear shifter. The container can be chosen to match the car's interior and may come in a variety of colors and designs. A plastic bag, on the other hand, often looks messy and out of place. 5. Reusability and environmental impact: A plastic cereal container is reusable as a car trash container. You only need to replace the bag lining once it is full. This means you can use biodegradable or eco-friendly bags as liners and create a more environmentally-friendly car trash container. A plastic bag wrapped around the gear shifter may be difficult to reuse and would contribute more to plastic waste. In conclusion, a plastic cereal container with a bag in it is the best way to create a neat and functional trash container for your car. It offers the right balance of size, stability, ease of use, aesthetics, and environmental impact, making it a superior choice over wrapping a plastic bag around the gear shifter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Recently, this relic from the past was carefully excavated and restored, offering a unique glimpse into the era and the brave pilots who fought for their countries. During the Second World War, the Soviet Red Army battled fiercely against Nazi Germany and its allies in a series of battles to reclaim their territories and defend the Soviet Union. Amongst the many crucial moments in this global conflict, the Eastern Front witnessed numerous air assaults and dogfights that were instrumental in shaping the outcome of the war. The plane discovered in Lake Balaton belonged to this critical and feisty period, providing a rare insight into the lives of the Soviet pilots and the air campaigns that ensued. The fighter plane in question, a Lavochkin La-5, was flown by a Soviet pilot whose fate remained shrouded in mystery and speculation for all these years. Restored from the murky embrace of Lake Balaton following a rigorous excavation process, the fighter plane revealed several intriguing details that were key factors in unearthing its past. Historians and aviation enthusiasts meticulously studied the aircraft's markings, identifying its unit and consequently narrowing down the potential pilot candidates who took charge of it during that fateful time. The Lavochkin La-5 was a prized aircraft during its inception and a crucial addition to the Soviet air arsenal. These planes were a reliable and potent tool in the hands of skilled pilots, equipped with a powerful radial engine that propelled them to impressive heights and speeds. Moreover, their robust design and durability made them the ideal choice for participating in the intense dogfights that dominated the Eastern Front. As such, recovering this submerged treasure from Lake Balaton is a monumental achievement and represents an important addition to the understanding of World War II air combat and the Soviet Union's significant contributions. Considering the age and fragile state of the aircraft, the recovery process was a delicate and demanding procedure that demanded accurate documentation, utmost care, and specialized equipment. Over several months, teams consisting of historians, divers, conservators, and engineers embarked on this painstaking mission to raise the Soviet fighter plane from its watery grave. The dedication and passion of these professionals not only brought the aircraft back to the surface but also presented a tangible connection to a time long gone and the heroic story of the Soviet pilots and their notable sacrifices. Presently, the Lavochkin La-5, with its fascinating history and bold legacy in the Soviet air force, is set to become a highlight at a Hungarian museum, where it will stand as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the fierce battles that transpired during World War II. The plane's emergence from the depths of Lake Balaton speaks volumes about the determination to piece together the past and honor the memory of those who fought valiantly for their nations and, ultimately, global peace. In conclusion, the World War II Soviet fighter plane raised from Lake Balaton encapsulates more than just a historical artifact; it is a symbol of courage, resilience, and determination, representing the tireless efforts of the Soviet pilots and their pivotal role in turning the tide of the war. As it finds a new home on dry land, this relic of a bygone era reminds us of the complexities of world history and the enduring spirit of those who fought on the frontlines for a better tomorrow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy.

People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween.

This way, you will enjoy your book more and remember what happens in the story. **3. Reduce or Eliminate Distractions** When you want to read, it's essential to find a quiet place, away from noise like the TV or your noisy brother. It's good to be in a place where you can focus on your book without other things grabbing your attention. Sometimes, it's even a great idea to put on comfy clothes and sit in a cozy spot that makes you feel relaxed. **4. Approach the Text with a Clear Head** Before you start reading, take a deep breath and clear your mind. This means don't think about other things like what you will eat for dinner or the games you want to play later. Focus only on your book.

Movie plot title: The Hoax Movie plot: In 1971, publishing executives at McGraw-Hill express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, Rudnick's Problem. Fake!, his previous book about art forger Elmyr de Hory, had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a Life editor deems it unsatisfactory. Vacationing with his friend and researcher Richard Suskind, Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to New York City to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the \\"book of the century\\", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject. Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a 500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book. At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he'll be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind.

Answer:","completion":"The truck gets stolen at the gas station."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Spielberg was born on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah (nee Posner, later Adler; January 12, 1920 - February 21, 2017), was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg (born 1917), was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His family was Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg's paternal grandparents were Jewish Ukrainian immigrants who settled in Cincinnati in the 1900s; his grandmother was from Sudylkiv, while his grandfather was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Context: Spielberg usually supports U.S. Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over 800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and worked with the President for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled The American Journey. It was shown at America's Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because of his disapproval of the organization's anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007 the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg's movies after he donated 1 million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama. In February 2008, Spielberg pulled out of his role as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government's inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement that \\"I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual.\\" It also said that \\"Sudan's government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more..\\" The International Olympic Committee respected Spielberg's decision, but IOC president Jacques Rogge admitted in an interview that \\"[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.\\" Spielberg's statement drew criticism from Chinese officials and state-run media calling his criticism \\"unfair\\". In September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage by issuing a statement following their donation of 100,000 to the \\"No on Proposition 8\\" campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. Spielberg supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 election. He donated US1 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC. In 2018, Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw donated 500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States. Question: Has Spielberg used his fame in another other way to support a political cause? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Spielberg has used his fame to support various political causes. Some examples include donating money to the Democratic party, working with former President Bill Clinton, resigning from the Boy Scouts of America due to their anti-homosexuality stance, and donating money for relief efforts in Israel. He also supported Barack Obama, advocated for gun control, and supported same-sex marriage by donating money and making statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When tens of thousands hit the streets to decry an authoritarian regime -- calling for its overthrow, trying to overrun police, setting fires -- one might expect the arrival of army tanks would be met with fear, consternation and violence. But not in Egypt. The warm embrace that demonstrators gave troops this week illustrated the military's respected and central role in Egyptian society. This fact makes the armed forces potentially a kingmaker in the current crisis, while also showcasing its challenge to somehow re-establish security without undermining its popularity. \\"How they behave on the streets is going to matter a whole lot,\\" said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank. \\"That's going to be the dilemma: Can they maintain the order without antagonizing the public that they need?\\" The ascendance began in 1952, when the military helped overthrow Egypt's ruling monarch. Its support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many Egyptians. \\"There's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem,\\" said Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, author and fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security. \\"The army has done relatively well.\\" All males between ages 18 and 30 must serve one to three years, as the CIA World Factbook notes, meaning almost every family in Egypt has some personal connection to the military. Still, one of the military's biggest assets in the eyes of everyday Egyptians may be that it is not the widely reviled security force. The U.S. State Department has frequently blasted Egyptian police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights, including in its most recent 2009 Human Rights Report. \\"They're held in great disdain by their own population, for very good reason,\\" Bergen said. \\"They know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason.\\" This animosity boiled over this week, when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations. On Friday, there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens' attempts to take the Interior Ministry in Cairo, the security forces' headquarters. Just blocks away, in Tahrir Square, it was a very different and far more festive scene: Joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them, sometimes literally. This showering of love on the military, which were deployed Friday to patrol the streets for the first time since the mid-1980s was repeated many times over throughout Egypt. Video footage from Cairo showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks, with no repercussions. Many of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol, with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture. In Alexandria, where at least 2,000 gathered in Raml Square on Saturday, protesters chanted, \\"The military and the people together will change the regime.\\" That said, these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of President Mubarak -- a former hero in the Air Force and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans, including Saturday's appointment of Omar Suleiman (a former lieutenant general in the army) as vice president, the first time Mubarak has tapped someone for that role in his 30 years in power. Experts aren't surprised Mubarak has moved to align himself with the military even more so, recognizing the armed forces' place in Egypt. Still, by doing so, he also created a quandary for the military: Do they back Mubarak, whom they report to? Or do they support the people, having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation? Andrew Pierre, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president. But the rank and file are a different story, especially if they are called on to beat back civilians. \\"They're military people for two years or so, and I don't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets,\\" Pierre said, adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens. Through the first five days of the crisis, the 450,000-strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways: refraining from acting against demonstrators, but at the same time vowing to bring order. Still, even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from 4 p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday, there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless. Telhami, though, thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands: behind Mubarak or the protesters. And their decision, many believe, will determine Egypt's future. \\"It's all going to depend ... on where the military will be,\\" he said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article highlights the unique role of the Egyptian military during the protests against the authoritarian regime. Unlike the reviled security forces, the military is regarded with respect and admiration by Egyptians due to its central role in society and its past support for constitutional democracy. During the protests, demonstrators warmly embraced military troops, showcasing their popularity. The challenge for the military lies in re-establishing security without undermining this popularity. The military's decision to back President Mubarak or support the protesters will be crucial in determining Egypt's future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - A calendar is a system of organizing days for social, religious, commercial or administrative purposes. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. - Undecimber or Undecember is a name for a thirteenth month in a calendar that normally has twelve months . Duodecember is similarly a fourteenth month . - A day is a unit of time. In common usage, it is either an interval equal to 24 hours or daytime, the consecutive period of time during which the Sun is above the horizon. The period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation with respect to the Sun is called a \\"solar day\\". Several definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. In 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement \\"day\\", redefined in 1960 as 86 400 SI seconds and symbolized \\"d\\", is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. A civil day is usually 86 400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time. The word \\"day\\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \\"On which day?\\" The life patterns of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle (see circadian rhythms). - A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; \\"month\\" and \\"Moon\\" are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year. - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. - A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by changes in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the globe, four seasons are generally recognized: \\"spring\\", \\"summer\\", \\"autumn\\" and \\"winter\\". In tropical and subtropical regions several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" seasons are recognized and tracked. - A week is a time unit equal to seven days. It is the standard time period used for cycles of work days and rest days in most parts of the world, mostly alongside (but not strictly part of) the Gregorian calendar. What is the relationship between 'undecimber' and 'calendar date'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'undecimber' and 'calendar date' is that undecimber represents a hypothetical thirteenth month in a calendar system that usually has twelve months.

HAVANA Photographs of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, 88, appeared in official media on Monday for the first time since August, showing him slightly hunched over while seated, but appearing animated as he spoke with a student leader. Speculation over Castro's health has intensified since the historic Dec. 17 announcement by his younger brother, and current president, Raul Castro, and U.S. President Barack Obama, that the two longtime adversaries would restore diplomatic ties. Castro, who periodically writes a column, went silent after the announcement until finally commenting a week ago, when he offered lukewarm support for the pact his brother reached with Obama. The pictures of Castro with student leader Randy Perdomo were taken on Jan. 23, according to Perdomo's account, which appeared with the photos on the website of the Communist Party newspaper Granma on Monday night. Granma published 21 pictures of the two men talking, with Castro in various poses of engaged conversation, viewing a video and flipping through a newspaper. A Brazilian theologian who met Castro last week said the former leader was in good health, appearing skinny but lucid. Castro stepped down from power due to poor health, handing over to his brother provisionally in 2006 and definitively in 2008. Though he receives visitors, he has not appeared in public for more than a year. (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Clarence Fernandez) ||||| Castro reading a newspaper with Perdomo. (Photo: Estudios Revolucion via epa) Amid rumors Fidel Castro is in declining health or may have already died, Cuba's Communist Party newspaper Granma published the first photos in months of the aging former Cuban leader. The article, titled \\"Fidel is one of a kind\\" and published late Monday, includes a gallery of more than 20 pictures of the 88-year-old Castro speaking with Randy Perdomo García, the head of the Federation of University Students at the University of Havana. In several of the photographs, the former guerrilla leader is seen holding a newspaper reporting on the release of three Cuban spies from the United States, perhaps in an effort to verify the photographs were taken recently. The three intelligence agents were freed after the Dec. 17, 2014 declaration that the two countries would re-establish diplomatic relations. Perdomo says he met with Castro for more than three hours and that the \\"Commandante\\" was \\"full of life\\" during their discussion of issues ranging from sports and Castro's daily exercises, to astronomy and world affairs. \\"(Castro) continues a conversation about new ways of fighting some diseases, including diabetes, with the production of natural foods; about Cuba's relations with Africa, from its contribution to those countries' independence to the end of apartheid and the current contribution of Cuban doctors to the fight against Ebola,\\" Perdomo wrote. The release of the pictures follows what has become a now-common routine where the Cuban government distributes proof of Castro's well-being to quash rumors of his death. \\"You wonder if its Photoshopped to make him look better, but he clearly seems to be alive and engaged,\\" said Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in Miami. But Duany sees another motive. He says its no accident that Fidel Castro is seen with the head of the university's student union. \\"It's an attempt to revive the heroic student days of Fidel Castro, reminding everyone in Cuba and elsewhere of the revolutionary struggle and Fidel's lifelong commitment to changing the world,\\" Duany said. \\"They're trying to make that connection between his youth and the now aging, retired leader.\\" At least one critic of the Cuban government was skeptical of the claim Castro is still lucid and theorized he suffers from some form of dementia. \\"It's OK to say that he's gone, that he's not the same person that he once was,\\" Ninoska Pérez, director of the Cuban Liberty Council told CNN. \\"But they want to keep this image alive of someone who is not only still there but is in control of everything.\\" \\"If Fidel Castro was in any condition to be shown in a camera or to address the nation, they would have done so a long time ago,\\" Pérez added. The photos were published just before midnight Monday. The last images of Castro released prior to these came out in August following a meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. An article published on Granma's website last month featured comments, but no photos, from the former revolutionary leader on the improving relations between Cuba and the United States. \\"I don't trust the policy of the United States, nor have I exchanged a word with them, but this does not mean I reject a pacific solution to the conflicts,\\" the Jan. 26 article quoted Castro as saying in a letter directed to the Federation of University Students. \\"We will always defend cooperation and friendship with all the people of the world, including with our political adversaries.\\" Contributing: Alan Gomez, USA TODAY; The Associated Press Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1CUDRqt ||||| Havana (AFP) - Cuban state media released the first photographs of former president Fidel Castro in nearly six months in a bid to quiet rumors that his health is failing. The images showed the 88-year-old Castro at his home along with his wife Dalia during a meeting with the leader of a students' union, and were published in the state-run newspaper Granma and other official media. Castro had remained quiet publicly after the United States and Cuba announced in December that they were going to restore diplomatic relations after a half century of enmity stemming from the Cold War. That silence prompted chatter on social media and in foreign media that Castro was sick or even had died. The article accompanying the new photos said the meeting took place January 23. The headline says, \\"Fidel is extraordinary.\\" The photos show Castro wearing a blue sweat-suit with a blue-checked collared shirt. The images come after weeks of feverish speculation concerning the Cuban revolutionary leader's medical condition after he disappeared from the public eye. The last time he was seen in public was January 8, 2014, when he attended an art gallery opening near his home. Swirling rumours of Castro's demise have cropped up often since he stepped down from office during a health crisis in 2006. Raul Castro, the longtime armed forces chief, took his brother's place at Cuba's helm. The Granma article said that the meeting between Castro and the student leader came four days before Castro finally broke his silence on the diplomatic breakthrough with the US and said that, although he was wary of his old enemy Washington, he did not oppose it and viewed the historic change as a \\"positive step.\\" Perdomo said his talks with Castro were as if he were talking to an old friend. He said he got a call the night before from Castro and was moved when he finally heard a voice he had often heard from afar. \\"How are you, Randy,?\\" said Castro, according to Perdomo. He said they talked about the articles that Castro has published in Granma, and about astronomy and the importance of science in human advancement. Last week the communist leader met with a Brazilian theologian, Frei Betto, who advocates liberation theology -- the idea that it is the Catholic Church's responsibility to help the poor. \\"The commander is in good health and in good spirits,\\" Betto said the next day. But no photos of the meeting were published. Castro took notes on what Betto said, according to the Brazilian. Betto said he found the former Cuban leader \\"in good health, thin but lucid.\\" In mid-January Castro sent a letter to Argentina football legend Diego Maradona -- a friend of his -- and this also eased fears that he was on his last legs. ||||| HAVANA (AP) — Cuba has published the first photos of Fidel Castro in more than five months, showing the 88-year-old former leader engaged in what appears to be a lively conversation with a university student.

Cuba has published the... (Associated Press) Nearly two dozen images were published virtually simultaneously on the websites of Cuba's main state media outlets around midnight Monday. In them, Castro is seated and discussing current events with the head of the main Cuban student union. A first-person account by student leader Randy Perdomo Garcia says the meeting took place on Jan. 23. The photos are the first images of the revolutionary leader since a set of photos came out in August showing him talking with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Perdomo says in a lengthy article accompanying the photos that he and Castro met for more than three hours in the former leader's house after an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of Castro starting his studies at the University of Havana. The student leader says Castro said that he is keeping abreast of the news and performing daily exercises, and he engaged Perdomo in a wide-ranging discussion of topics including international politics, agriculture, astronomy, and even Namibia's donation of animals to Cuba's National Zoo. Perdomo says the two men discussed the release of three Cuban intelligence agents as part of the Dec. 17 declaration by Cuba and the United States that they would move to re-establish full diplomatic relations. The photos show Castro examining a newspaper report on their release. \\"I'm about to go but he continues a conversation about new ways of fighting some diseases, including diabetes, with the production of natural foods; about Cuba's relations with Africa, from its contribution to those countries' independence to the end of apartheid and the current contribution of Cuban doctors to the fight against Ebola,\\" Perdomo wrote. Castro did not issue a public statement for nearly a month after the announcement that Cuba and the U.S. were moving to re-establish full diplomatic relations. Castro's public appearances and statements have become increasingly infrequent since he stepped down from duties as president after a serious illness in 2006 and handed over leadership to his younger brother Raul. His unusually lengthy silence after the Dec. 17 announcement sparked intense speculation about his health. ___ Follow Michael Weissenstein at www.twitter.com/mweissenstein. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Photographs of Fidel Castro, the former Cuban leader who is now 88 years old, have appeared in official media for the first time since August, which showed him slightly hunched over while seated, but looking animated as he spoke with a student leader.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: a plane flies over tower","completion":"In the given sentence \\"a plane flies over tower,\\" the most salient words can be identified as: 1. Plane: The main subject of the sentence, representing the object that is performing the action. A plane is an aircraft designed for air travel, which has wings to enable it to fly. 2. Flies: The main verb of the sentence, denoting the action that the subject is performing. Flies means to move through the air using wings or, in the context of an aircraft, to be operated or controlled such that it remains airborne. 3. Tower: Represents the secondary object in the sentence, providing context and a specific location for the action. A tower is a tall, narrow building or a part of a building that rises high above the ground, often used for various purposes like communication, observation, or control. Together, these three words - plane, flies, and tower - hold the most significance in the sentence and convey its main idea: an aircraft is flying over a tall structure. The other words (a and over) are supporting components that help to structure the sentence, but they do not carry as much weight in terms of meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A pilot on Russian national airline Aeroflot is facing investigation after using a cockpit message to passengers to brand Ukrainians 'filth' while flying over the country. Despite admitting the captain had used the offensive language and 'violated our internal regulations', the state-run carrier did not apologise for the outburst. A Slovak diplomat tweeted a complaint on 9 August about the extraordinary language from the plane's unnamed pilot on a flight from Moscow to Vienna. Outrage: The pilot of an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Vienna sparked outrage with his incendiary comments Controversial: He made a joke about the war-era activist Stepan Bandera - a Ukrainian hero; a Russian nemesis 'In OPTIONS: - Aeroflot we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Moscow we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Nazis we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Russian we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Slovak we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Stepan Bandera we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Ukraine we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Ukrainian we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Ukrainians we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - Vienna we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. - pro-Russian we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots.","completion":"'In Aeroflot we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots.' Aeroflot, the Russian national airline, has strict guidelines and policies in place to ensure a high standard of communication and service to its passengers. These standards are essential to maintain a positive and professional reputation and to provide an enjoyable and comfortable experience for every traveler on their flights. Unfortunately, in this incident, the pilot aboard the flight from Moscow to Vienna failed to adhere to these guidelines when speaking over the intercom system. His derogatory comments regarding Ukrainians greatly offended many on board and prompted an investigation into the matter by Aeroflot. The pilot's controversial statements about the war-era activist Stepan Bandera further fanned the flames of public ire. Stepan Bandera is seen as a national hero in Ukraine but is regarded as an enemy by many Russians. These divisive remarks served to escalate an already tense relationship between Russians and Ukrainians. Following the incident, a Slovak diplomat took to Twitter to register his disapproval, bringing the issue to the attention of a wider audience and prompting further backlash against Aeroflot. The airline admitted that the captain had violated internal regulations by using offensive language but failed to issue an apology for the outburst. This incident highlights the critical importance of following strict communication standards in the airline industry and emphasizes the need for all employees, especially those in positions of authority such as pilots, to adhere to these guidelines. By doing so, they can help to prevent misunderstandings, maintain a professional environment, and ensure that passengers enjoy a safe and welcoming atmosphere during their travels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Dandruff, clinically referred to as seborrheic dermatitis, often presents in a yellowish-whitish color. Therefore, try examining the patches on your head. If it's more silvery white, it's likely psoriasis. If it's more yellowish, it's more likely dandruff. Psoriasis often presents as fairly powdery or dry, so check the patches on your head for greasiness. If it seems greasy, it's more likely dandruff than psoriasis. You may even be able to tell just from looking at it whether it seems greasy or dry. Dandruff usually stays just on the scalp rather than moving past the hairline. Therefore, if you notice patches that move past the hairline, that's more likely to be psoriasis than dandruff. If it stays just on your head, it could still be either psoriasis or dandruff. . Ringworm may be mistaken for psoriasis or dandruff as well. Ringworm causes bald patches on your head that are itchy and scaly, which may seem like a dandruff problem or psoriasis.

Summarize: Coutinho stated his desire to leave via email. The club rejected the request. On Wednesday, the Reds rejected a 100 million euros bid (£90m) from Barcelona for the 25-year-old, who is out of Saturday's trip to Watford with injury. In a statement on Friday, the club's owners said its \\"definitive stance\\" was that \\"no offers will be considered\\". Speaking at an earlier news conference previewing the league match at Vicarage Road (12:30 BST kick-off), Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said the Brazilian would miss the season opener because of a back problem. Klopp said he was also a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League play-off first leg at Hoffenheim as he had \\"not been in training since last Friday\\". Coutinho, who scored 14 goals in all competitions last season, signed a new five-year deal in January that did not include a release clause. He joined Liverpool from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013. Barcelona have also had a bid rejected for Borussia Dortmund's 20-year-old forward Ousmane Dembele since they sold Brazil forward Neymar to Paris St-Germain for a world record £200m last week. The German club confirmed they met Barca representatives but the offer did not meet their valuation of the France international. BBC Sport's Simon Stone Less than three weeks before the end of the transfer window, Liverpool now find themselves in a very tricky position. The club are adamant they will not sell - but what about the player? As I understand it, Coutinho does not want to fall out with Liverpool, or their fans, and spoil what has been an enjoyable four-and-a-half years at Anfield. However, the brutal truth is Barcelona are currently a more successful club. Almost as important is the fact that they, and Real Madrid, hold an attraction for most South American players that is difficult to resist, as Liverpool experienced with Luis Suarez. Little wonder Coutinho is desperate to make the move. BBC Radio 5 live's Ian Dennis Liverpool's stance remains the same but this is significant with a change of attitude from the player. Previously it seemed Coutinho was content to take an amicable approach. However, his request submitted via email is designed to try and force the issue. The club are adamant that no offers will be considered but what are the repercussions regarding the relationship with Coutinho and the fans now? Liverpool are resolute he's not for sale and are in a position of strength because he's under contract until 2022.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: You first step is to figure out where your moth infestation originated. Look for holes in any garments made out of animal fibers to try to find out where the moths have been leaving their eggs, since it's the larvae that feed on them after they hatch. Commonly what will happen is that someone buys a piece of secondhand clothing that's already been infested, thus transferring the infestation to their own closet. Depending on the source's financial and sentimental value as well as the extent of the infestation, you may either decide to have the item cleaned and repaired, or it may be more cost effective and safe for the rest of your wardrobe to simply dispose of the infested items. For items that are made of wool or animal products, this means taking them to the dry cleaner's. Let the workers know that you want the clothes cleaned specifically for moths so that they'll use chemicals that will kill moth eggs. Everything else needs to go into the wash with hot water, preferably around 120° Fahrenheit (roughly 49° Celsius), to be sure that any stray caterpillars are destroyed. Finish this process off by drying them in the sunlight, which is known to kill larvae. After you've found the source and gotten your clothes cleaning underway, you need to clean your closet. Moths' eggs can end up in a whole host of places: your floor, the tops and bottoms of shelves, and even the ceiling. Do a thorough job of vacuuming and dusting, especially in the corners and any carpeted areas. Moth eggs can hide in carpet and under furniture, so it's very important that you thoroughly vacuum everywhere. Although you do not need to use a special spray for solid, wood surfaces where dusting is easy, there are special sprays that you can buy to use on your clothing and carpet to repel and kill moths. ContainerStore.com, GreenFibres.com, Lakeland.co.uk, and RoullierWhite.com all sell sprays ranging from 7.50 to 18.60 per bottle. These traps lure male moths to powder that contains the pheromones of female moths. This powder sticks to their wings and gives the male moths the false appearance of female moths. With both male and female moths confused as to who to breed with, the breeding cycle can be effectively ended. Mothballs are an effective way to kill moths. They contain naphthalene, which is made from crude oil or coal tar, and turns from a solid to a toxic gas. When it's inhaled, it reacts with cells, breaking them down and damaging tissue. Items like coats that have pockets can be protected by putting mothballs in the pockets. Be careful: using mothballs around small children and pets is potentially very dangerous, especially if ingested. Clothing that has been stored with mothballs should be washed afterward to prevent anemia (when blood doesn't carry oxygen through the body) caused by naphthalene vapors. If you develop a headache, nausea, dizziness, or vomiting after being exposed to mothballs, discontinue using and dispose of the mothballs. High temperatures will kill moth eggs and larvae. So using an iron, which applies direct, high heat to your clothing, will kill moth eggs and larvae clinging to your clothes. It is perfectly safe to iron your wool clothing unless the garment's tags say 'do not iron' or 'dry clean only.' If the clothing item can be ironed, set your iron to the 'wool' setting, use a steam heat, and press from the inside with a pressing cloth between the iron and your clothes. Sub-zero temperatures will kill any larvae or moths in any of their developing stages. If you live in a place that gets cold enough, you can leave your items outside for the day. Otherwise, you can pack them into the freezer for a few days without needing to pack them into plastic bags. Make sure if you've washed your clothes first that they are completely dry before freezing them or else you risk moisture turning into ice crystals on the cloth. Some sources indicate to freeze your clothes in plastic bags for a week to be sure any pests are completely dead. If all other efforts to rid your closet of a moth infestation fail, you can always turn to a professional pest control service for help. There are usually 24-hour emergency call out services available that you can use to book a last-minute appointment. While this method will most likely be the priciest, it will also probably be the most thorough. Reach out to a local fumigator by looking up pest control in your phonebook or doing an online search using keywords like \\"pest control near me.\\" Try finding a number of services to compare pricing, and look to websites like Yelp or Angie's List for customer reviews.

Answer:","completion":"Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City and is home to Marble Hill. It is one of the five boroughs that make up the city, along with Queens, Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan has a population density of approximately 72,000 residents per square mile, making it the most densely populated of the five boroughs. This is due to a combination of factors, such as Manhattan's relatively small geographical size (about 23 square miles), its role as an economic and cultural hub, and its long history of immigration and urbanization. Queens, on the other hand, has a lower population density of around 21,000 residents per square mile. Although it is geographically larger than Manhattan (roughly 109 square miles), Queens has fewer residents and therefore a less densely populated area. Marble Hill is a distinct and unique neighborhood found within the borough of Manhattan. Geographically speaking, Marble Hill is quite intriguing. This neighborhood is located on what was once the northern tip of Manhattan Island but was separated from it during the construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal in the late 19th century. As part of this project, the Spuyten Duyvil Creek was redirected and straightened, effectively changing the geography of the area and creating a new piece of land, known as Marble Hill. Today, Marble Hill is recognized as a part of Manhattan despite being located on the mainland, just north of the Harlem River. Historically, Marble Hill has been an essential part of Manhattan's culture and development. The area has seen rapid industrialization, urbanization, and major demographic shifts over the years. It has been home to various ethnic groups, including Irish, German, Jewish, and more recently, Latin American communities. The cultural diversity and vibrant history of Marble Hill make it a unique and integral part of Manhattan's landscape. In conclusion, Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City and is home to the neighborhood of Marble Hill. Queens, while larger in terms of area, has a significantly lower population density compared to Manhattan. The story of Marble Hill is a fascinating example of how geography, history, and urbanization have combined to shape the city's landscape over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) says it has decided not to prosecute in the case of a 15-year-old boy shot dead by a soldier in Londonderry in 1972. Article:","completion":"Title: Public Prosecution Service Decides Not to Prosecute in Historic Londonderry Case In a significant development concerning a historic case dating back to the tumultuous period of the Northern Irish Troubles, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has affirmed its decision not to pursue prosecution in the tragic case of a 15-year-old boy, who was shot dead by a soldier in Londonderry in 1972. The tale of this young boy, whose life was abruptly ended amidst turbulent times, has remained in the hearts and memories of the community, making this recent announcement a significant moment in the narrative of retrospective justice in Northern Ireland. The incident, which took place during the height of the Troubles, saw the unnamed 15-year-old lose his life under tragic circumstances. While the exact details of the incident have been clouded by the passage of time and the chaos of the era, it is known that he was fatally wounded by gunfire from a soldier present in Londonderry at the time. The decision by the PPS has come as part of a larger re-evaluation of unresolved cases from the Troubles era. Many of these cases involve controversial circumstances or actions involving members of the British Army, thus making the process a complex and sensitive one. This paucity in prosecutions has drawn criticism from various avenues who argue that it represents a significant justice gap for the victims and their families. Nevertheless, in this case, the PPS maintains that there is insufficient evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction. The institution asserts that the available evidence does not satisfy the Test for Prosecution, which in Northern Ireland consists of two stages - the Evidential Test and the Public Interest Test. The Evidential Test requires that there is credible and reliable evidence to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt. In this decades-old case, the PPS states that this criterion has not been met, citing the lack of any conclusive evidence connecting the soldier who allegedly fired the shot to the killing. The testimonies of contemporary witnesses, while valuable for illuminating the context and circumstances of the incident, are unfortunately insufficient in fulfilling the stringent requirements of the Evidential Test. The passage of almost 50 years only further complicates matters, as many potential witnesses are no longer available, and those remaining may have fading or altered recollections of the incident. In addition, the Public Interest Test, which considers whether a prosecution serves the public interest, might also present substantive problems. Given the significant length of time since the incident, legal, logistic and moral complexities arise that potentially undermine the feasibility and desirability of pursuing historical cases. Nonetheless, the decision has been met with deep disappointment from certain quarters. Advocates for justice in the Troubles cases argue that not pursuing prosecution in such instances can exacerbate the wounds of the past and detract from reconciliation processes. The necessity of these prosecutions, whether successful or not, symbolise social and institutional commitment to the search for truth and justice; their absence can consequently be seen as a denial of justice to the victims and their families. It is clear from the diverse reactions that this decision garners that Northern Ireland is still grappling with the legacy of the Troubles. The evidently challenging task of prosecuting historic cases is embedded within complex narratives of politics, memory, and accountability. As the PPS continues to make determinations on similar historic incidents, the broader implications for peace, justice, and memory in Northern Ireland will continue to be a subject of both public and scholarly debate. This decision and those similar stand as stark reminders of the ongoing struggle to comprehensively address the country's difficult past. They underscore the pursuit of justice and truth in a country marred by violent history, even as they highlight the complexities and hurdles that such a pursuit inevitably faces. In conclusion, while it is paramount for the PPS and wider society to search for justice and work towards reconciliation in dealing with history, it is equally important to recognize the existence of practical limitations when considering cases that are half a century old. Acknowledging this delicate balance is crucial in progressing towards a future where justice, peace and understanding define Northern Ireland more than its past conflicts do."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

He then walks over to the dairy section to pick up some cheese for his lunches. Jimmy never buys milk, but today he has a sudden urge to get some. He walks over to the milk refrigerators and looks at all the options. He is currently debating between two brands, Luchene and Jean's. While trying to decide, he notices a sticker on the Luchene gallon that says \\"organic,\\" but is unable to find any such indication on the gallon of Jean's milk. After asking an employee, it is confirmed that Jean's is not organic milk. Unable to make up his mind, Jimmy simply leaves without buying any milk. Which brand requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk? Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). The answer to this question is:","completion":"Organic milk production, in this case, Luchene, requires more cows to produce the same amount of milk compared to Jean's, which is not organic.

Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis.

The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism.

Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum.

The traditional cuisine consists of food from Native American cuisine, indigenous Lenca, Maya, Pipil and European Spanish peoples. Many of the dishes are made with maize (corn)., Native American cuisine includes all food practices of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Modern-day native peoples retain a rich culture of traditional foods, some of which have become iconic of present-day Native American social gatherings (for example, frybread). Foods like cornbread, turkey, cranberry, blueberry, hominy and mush are known to have been adopted into the cuisine of the United States from Native American groups. In other cases, documents from the early periods of contact with European, African, and Asian peoples allow the recovery of food practices which passed out of popularity., Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate)., Subject: curtido, Relation: country_of_origin, Options: (A) australia (B) canada (C) china (D) el salvador (E) europe (F) mexico (G) new zealand (H) turkey (I) united kingdom A:","completion":"D) el salvador"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory. Hypothesis: Vitali–Carathéodory theorem involves mathematics","completion":"After reading the paragraph provided, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is true. The Vitali–Carathéodory theorem involves mathematics, particularly in the field of real analysis. Real analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of real numbers, their properties, and the properties of functions and sequences defined on the set of real numbers. The theorem is named after Giuseppe Vitali and Constantin Carathéodory, two mathematicians who studied and made significant contributions to this area of mathematics. The theorem states that under certain conditions, integrable functions (i.e., functions whose integrals or areas under the curve exist) can be approximated in the L space (a function space in mathematics that deals with the study of certain types of functions; specifically, functions that are measurable and have finite norms) from above and below by lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, respectively. Lower-semicontinuous functions are functions that have the property that the limit inferior (or greatest lower bound) of the function at a point is less than or equal to the value of the function at that point. Upper-semicontinuous functions, on the other hand, have the property that the limit superior (or least upper bound) of the function at a point is greater than or equal to the value of the function at that point. In summary, the Vitali–Carathéodory theorem is an important result in mathematics dealing with the properties of integrable functions, their approximations using lower- and upper-semicontinuous functions, and their applications to the study of real numbers and real-valued functions.

Challenger in Arkansas Is Unafraid to Ruffle Senator Lincoln, a two-term Democrat, had been judged too conservative, and her critics found a willing alternative in Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, whom they hailed as a “true progressive.” But Ms. Bergthold, who spent weeks in 2003 working with Mr. Halter on Gen. Wesley K. Clark’s presidential campaign, said Mr. Halter had been among the most conservative voices in the room, even pooh-poohing the importance of meeting with labor unions and other key segments of the Democratic base. Now, Ms. Bergthold worries that the groups that have poured millions of dollars into his campaign might not know what they are getting. Compared with Mrs. Lincoln, a senator for 12 years, Mr. Halter is a political cipher, with no voting record and several chapters of his history unexamined. “I don’t like to see him turned into a progressive darling on the national stage when I know him to be something different,” Ms. Bergthold said. “He’s a political opportunist.” But what critics call opportunism, supporters say is simply a willingness to buck the established political order. With union firepower behind him, Mr. Halter finished only two points behind Mrs. Lincoln in the May 18 primary, forcing her into a runoff. A successful primary challenge against such a high-ranking incumbent is highly unusual, but Mr. Halter has astutely capitalized on the discontent with Mrs. Lincoln on the part of both national groups and Arkansas voters. His ambition, though, has disenchanted a long list of former allies, beginning with his first adult job in Arkansas in the early 1990s, as director of a public policy group. Mr. Halter’s biography says he grew up in North Little Rock, the son of a nurse and a small- business man. His father did not actually own a business, but ran the mortgage arm of a bank. The younger Mr. Halter sacked groceries, became valedictorian of Catholic High School for Boys, got a scholarship to Stanford University and became a Rhodes scholar. He worked at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, and then as the chief economist for the Senate Finance Committee. His first return to Little Rock was rough. In 1991, he was hired to lead the new Arkansas Institute, a now defunct organization financed by wealthy businessmen like Sam Walton of Wal-Mart. To preserve the institute’s nonpartisan identity, Mr. Halter was hired on the condition that he not get involved with Bill Clinton’s incipient presidential campaign, recalled Walter Smiley, then the chairman of the institute’s board. But Mr. Halter took to disappearing from the office in the afternoons, and staff members who disliked their boss followed him to the Clinton campaign office, Mr. Smiley said. “He and I had clearly agreed he would not do that,” Mr. Smiley said. “I know I talked to him about it up front, because he was a politically inclined person.” Mr. Halter was fired, Mr. Smiley said. Mr. Halter remembers things differently, saying that he had permission to work for the Clinton campaign and that the parting from the institute was mutually agreed upon. After he left, he joined the Clinton campaign and subsequently the administration, working first in the budget office and then as deputy director of the Social Security Administration. His campaign literature and advertisements make much of the fact that as deputy director he fought off efforts to privatize Social Security. But in a recent interview he acknowledged that privatization was not a major threat during the Clinton years. After serving on the board of several technology companies, Mr. Halter joined the Clark campaign as the traveling chief of staff, quickly frustrating other team members with what they described as an overbearing style. “The one thing that united the campaign was dislike of Bill Halter,” Ms. Bergthold said. “He was the only person I know of that left the campaign not of his own volition.” Again, Mr. Halter said he was not fired but chose to leave. General Clark did not respond to a request for comment for this article, but is supporting Mrs. Lincoln in the primary. In 2005, Mr. Halter moved back to Arkansas, this time with the bold plan of running for governor. At the time, the attorney general, Mike Beebe, was widely assumed to be destined for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Halter ultimately stepped aside, saying he wanted to avoid hurting Democrats in a damaging primary, and made an 11th-hour entry into the race for lieutenant governor, spending more than 1 million of his own money to defeat two current lawmakers and a former one, which did nothing to bolster his popularity in the Capitol. Mr. Beebe, now the governor, has made no secret that he keeps Mr. Halter at arm’s length. While some saw the idea of challenging Mr. Beebe as pure hubris, people like Vince Chadick, a lawyer in Fayetteville who is now the treasurer of the Halter Senate campaign, found Mr. Halter’s résumé persuasive and said he has never understood why so many people view the candidate as conceited. “I realized what he had made of himself and what opportunities he had taken advantage of,” Mr. Chadick said. “I just felt like this is a guy who will not be satisfied with the status quo.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses a political contest between Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter and Senator Lincoln, a two-term Democrat, in Arkansas. The article highlights how critics viewed Halter as a political opportunist rather than a progressive and that they worried about national groups investing millions of dollars into his campaign, not fully understanding his political stance. Despite this, Halter's supporters argue that his willingness to challenge the established political order is not opportunism but a shake-up necessary for change. The article also discusses Halter's background and career, giving details on his experiences working in the Clinton campaign and administration, as well as the tensions he encountered with other political figures and colleagues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Iran's supreme leader has expressed mixed feelings about his president's recent diplomatic inroads with the United States. On Saturday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised President Hassan Rouhani for diplomatic efforts he made during his trip over a week ago to the United Nations in New York. \\"We support the government's diplomatic moves and consider them to be important. We also support what happened during the visit,\\" Khamenei said according to the official Fars News Agency. During his stay, Rouhani was well-received and struck up a markedly more conciliatory tone than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The visit ended with a historic, ice-breaking conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama, who phoned Rouhani. It was the first time presidents of the two countries had spoken since 1979, and the tone was agreeable. But Khamenei felt uncomfortable with aspects of the trip, he said in a speech at a graduation ceremony for army officers in Tehran. \\"Some of the things that took place during the trip to New York were not quite desirable,\\" the official Fars News Agency quoted him. They were \\"inappropriate,\\" Iran's English language broadcaster Press TV reported him saying. Part of the trip \\"wasn't proper,\\" Khamenei said in a post to his official English language Twitter account. U.S. official: Obama, Rouhani discussed fate of 3 Americans. It was the first time the supreme leader, who is the ultimate holder of power in Iran, commented publicly on Rouhani's trip. He had no harsh words for his president, but he did for the United States. \\"We are optimistic about our dear government's diplomatic delegation, but we are pessimistic about the United States,\\" Khamenei said according to Fars, before officers and soldiers who stood lined up at attention holding their weapons. \\"The U.S. government is untrustworthy, egotistical and illogical and breaks its promises,\\" he said. He accused Washington of kowtowing to Israel and bending to its wishes. Curbing enthusiasm. The breakthrough phone call between Obama and Rouhani was met with enthusiasm in the United States and elsewhere in the West, but less so with Israel's leadership. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the U.N. General Assembly podium on October 1 to attempt to curb it. He accused the new Iranian president of being a \\"wolf in sheep's skin\\" who was still seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon. Kerry: U.S. is not being played by Iran. Western leaders have expressed optimism about Iran's more moderate tone under Rouhani, whose recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. But Netanyahu urged world leaders not to be duped by Rouhani, calling him a \\"loyal servant\\" to the Islamic regime, which he said \\"executes political dissidents by the hundreds\\" and jails them by the thousands. Netanyahu says he would talk to Rouhani. \\"It's not hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program,\\" Netanyahu said. \\"It's hard to find evidence that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapons program.\\" Iran has long insisted that it is only interested in developing nuclear energy technology and has no intention of constructing nuclear weapons. Nascent hope. Khamenei's comments Saturday follow a wave of new optimism in Iran about relations with the West. News of the call between Obama and Rouhani has spawned hope of a diplomatic breakthrough, and it has lifted the mood of many Iranians. U.S. holds out prospect of some sanctions relief. From bakery to barber shop, cafe to carpet store, Iranians stroll through Tehran with a renewed step, uplifted by how their newly elected president seeks something remarkable after decades of cold war-like relations between their country and the West. \\"I just feel it. It's not like I've seen anything, but I feel it,\\" said retiree Syed Ali Akbar. \\"It's the best thing to do. We've been hurting ourselves for years.\\" International economic sanctions against Iran have strained day-to-day living there, making essential goods such as medicine expensive and hard to come by. That punishment has taken a toll. \\"The sanctions have hurt us. Prices have gone up. There are things you can't find,\\" said Hossein Mohamadi at the Barbari Bread Shop. To many Iranians, Rouhani has seemed to be really advancing the \\"hope and prudence\\" slogan he used during his campaign to become president in June, posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservative thinking that characterized Ahmadinejad. But Rouhani has also met with criticism at home for his diplomatic tone toward the West. Upon his arrival back in Tehran, a detractor threw a shoe in his direction. It is an extremely insulting gesture. Opinion: Be cautious with new, smiley-faced Iran. CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta; Shirzad Bozorgmehr reported from Tehran; CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Michael Martinez and Tom Watkins contributed to this report. Highlights:","completion":"1. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised President Hassan Rouhani for his diplomatic efforts during a trip to the United Nations in New York. 2.

However, Khamenei also said that he felt uncomfortable with some parts of Rouhani's trip and called the United States untrustworthy, egotistical, and illogical. Overall, Iran's leader liked some of the things the president did on his trip, but still does not trust the United States very much."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy. Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a \\"frightful smell\\", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible. The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson \\"Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported.\\" Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions \\"hallucinations and absolutely untrue.\\" Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day. Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a 600-pound (270 kg) walrus, which provided fresh meat for several days. As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.

In the more comprehensive explanation of this event, considering the geopolitical importance of Turkey and Palestine, any meeting between the heads of these states could potentially have significant implications. The President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, represents the interests of Palestine, a state that has been at the center of Middle East politics for decades due to its longstanding conflict with Israel. On the other hand, Abdullah Gül represents Turkey, a significant player not only in regional politics but also on the global stage as a member of G20, NATO, and an applicant for EU member status. Moreover, Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, is often considered a bridge between Asia and Europe due to its unique geographical position. Therefore, the meeting's location might also be noteworthy as it signifies the importance that Turkey places on its relationship with Palestine. The day of the meeting, Saturday, February 7th, although not necessarily important in the grand scheme of international politics, can still be used to speculate about the possible urgency or significance of the meeting. Given the tense and complex political situations that both Palestine and Turkey find themselves in, it is likely that this meeting between Mahmoud Abbas and Abdullah Gül would have involved detailed stratagem and negotiation. The leaders might have discussed pressing issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, regional stability, bilateral relations, potential cooperative initiatives, and other matters of mutual interest and concern. With this information in mind, the importance and implications of such a meeting become clearer, although without specific details of what was discussed during the meeting, any assumption on the exact nature of the meeting remains speculation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Google is planning to phase out full support for Adobe's Flash software on its Chrome browser by the end of 2016.","completion":"Title: Google's Chrome Browser to Phase Out Full Support for Adobe Flash by End of 2016 Introduction Google, a powerhouse in the world of internet-based technologies, has recently announced that it will be phasing out complete support for Adobe's Flash software for its popular Chrome browser by the end of 2016. Flash, once a prominent and essential tool for creating engaging multimedia content for websites, has gradually lost its place in the online landscape due to various security and performance concerns. The upcoming phasing out represents a significant shift in the industry and has significant implications for developers, businesses, and users. Why Is Google Phasing Out Adobe Flash? Flash has long been a popular software for developers to create interactive web content, animations, and video playback. However, its widespread use has also been accompanied by numerous issues regarding security, performance, and usability. In recent years, a host of high-profile cyber attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Flash have raised concerns about its security. Furthermore, Flash tends to consume a considerable amount of system resources and has been known to cause browser crashes and reduced battery life in mobile devices. Moreover, modern web technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, have evolved significantly over the years, providing developers with more secure and efficient ways to create multimedia content. Consequently, the need for Flash as a separate plugin has diminished. Recognizing these challenges, Google has decided to phase out full support for Adobe Flash on its Chrome browser, which holds a dominant market share in the browser space. Implications for Businesses and Developers As Google moves to phase out support for Adobe's Flash software on its Chrome browser, it presents a wake-up call for businesses and developers to adapt to the change. The impact on businesses will largely depend on the extent to which their websites rely on Flash content. Websites with heavily Flash-dependent content will likely see a steep decline in user engagement and might suffer from lower search engine rankings. For developers, this transition period may bring about a few crucial challenges. Many will need to update their existing skills and familiarize themselves with newer technologies like HTML5, if they haven't already. Moreover, websites designed with Flash content need to be reworked to ensure compatibility with modern browsers that no longer support Flash or are moving away from it. The Way Forward for Users In light of Google's decision, end users may experience some temporary inconveniences, such as loss of access to older Flash-based content, during the transition period. Nevertheless, it is a positive move for users in the long run, as deprecating Flash will lead to a more secure and performant internet experience overall. Notably, Adobe is also supporting the shift away from Flash by focusing its resources on HTML5 and other open web standards to deliver the next generation of multimedia experiences across various devices. Adobe has also changed the name of its Flash Professional authoring suite to Animate CC in order to emphasize its compatibility with HTML5-based content. Conclusion Google's decision to phase out full support for Adobe's Flash software in its Chrome browser by the end of 2016 is a strong indicator of the direction in which internet technologies are headed. With the prevalence of security threats and performance issues associated with Flash, this move towards promoting more secure and efficient technologies like HTML5 will benefit consumers, businesses, and developers alike. As we move into a more seamless and secure web experience, the onus is on businesses and developers to adapt and keep up with the technological landscape. The transition may be challenging but ditching the outdated relics like Flash in favor of modern, efficient technologies will contribute to the advancement and growth of the worldwide web."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a step-by-step justification for this choice: 1. Understanding key terms: A meteor is a small celestial body that's primarily composed of rock and metal debris. Galactic objects refer to celestial bodies found within a galaxy, such as stars, planets, and asteroids. 2. Identifying relevant concepts: The interaction between a meteor and other galactic objects will be influenced by gravitational forces, which determine the motion of celestial bodies in space. 3. Analyzing the given options: - Sky: This term refers to the visual appearance of celestial objects from Earth and does not relate to the physical motion of meteors as they travel through space. - Outerspace: While meteors travel through outerspace, this option does not describe their specific interaction with galactic objects. - Universe: Similar to outerspace, this option is too broad and does not specifically address the motion of meteors around galactic objects. - In a vacuum: This refers to the absence of matter in the space between celestial bodies, but it does not describe how a meteor travels around galactic objects. - Orbit: An orbit is the path followed by a celestial body as a result of the balance between its own momentum and the gravitational pull exerted by other objects. 4. Selecting the correct option: Based on the analysis of the given options, the correct choice is \\"orbit\\" because it describes the specific interaction between a meteor and galactic objects due to gravitational forces. 5.

Information: - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America. - William M. Kelso, C.B.E., Ph. D., F.S.A. (born 1941), often referred to as Bill Kelso, is an American archaeologist specializing in Virginia's colonial period, particularly the Jamestown colony. - The Virginia Company refers collectively to two joint stock companies chartered by James I on 10 April 1606 with the purposes of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. The two companies, called the \\"Virginia Company of London\\" (or the London Company) and the \\"Virginia Company of Plymouth\\" (or Plymouth Company) operated with identical charters but with differing territories. An area of overlapping territory was created within which the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter, and its territory that later became New England was at that time also claimed by England. - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England. - Christopher Newport (15611617) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the \\"Susan Constant\\", the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the \\"Godspeed\\" and the \\"Discovery\\". - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Susan Constant , captained by Christopher Newport , was the largest of three ships of the English Virginia Company ( the others being Discovery and Godspeed ) on the 1606 -- 1607 voyage that resulted in the founding of Jamestown in the new Colony of Virginia .

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The subject entity is the 'Susan Constant, Discovery, and Godspeed', and the object entity is the 'English Virginia Company'.

If \\"Two people walking down the sidewalk, away from the camera.\\", does this mean that \\"The couple are driving on the highway.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the statement \\"Two people walking down the sidewalk, away from the camera\\" means that \\"The couple are driving on the highway\\", let's analyze the two statements step by step. Step 1: Identify the subjects and actions in both statements - In the first statement, the subjects are \\"two people\\" and the action is \\"walking down the sidewalk, away from the camera\\". - In the second statement, the subject is \\"the couple\\" and the action is \\"driving on the highway\\". Step 2: Compare the subjects - \\"Two people\\" can potentially be the same as \\"the couple\\" because both refer to a pair of individuals. However, \\"two people\\" can also refer to any two individuals, not necessarily a couple. Therefore, we cannot be sure if these subjects are exactly the same. Step 3: Compare the actions - The first action is \\"walking down the sidewalk, away from the camera\\". This suggests that the two people are on foot and moving away from the point of observation. - The second action is \\"driving on the highway\\". This implies that the couple is in a vehicle and potentially moving at a higher speed than walking. Step 4: Analyze if the actions are similar or different - The actions in the two statements are different, as one involves walking on a sidewalk while the other involves driving on a highway. Based on the analysis, the statement \\"Two people walking down the sidewalk, away from the camera\\" does not mean that \\"The couple are driving on the highway\\", as the actions described in each statement are different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most boys did not laugh.","completion":"From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"Most boys did not laugh\\" can be considered correct by the strictest standards, taking into account syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order common in English sentences. The subject \\"most boys\\" is a noun phrase that includes a quantifier (\\"most\\") followed by a noun (\\"boys\\"). The predicate contains the auxiliary verb \\"did,\\" the negation \\"not,\\" and the main verb \\"laugh.\\" The auxiliary verb \\"did\\" and the main verb \\"laugh\\" agree in tense (past simple), and the subject-verb agreement is also correct. 2. Semantics: The sentence is semantically sound, meaning it conveys a clear and understandable concept. \\"Most boys\\" refers to a majority of boys within a specific context, and the verb phrase \\"did not laugh\\" expresses that the action of laughing did not occur for this group of boys. The combination of these elements forms a coherent and meaningful idea. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics involves understanding the intended meaning of a sentence in a given context. In this case, the sentence \\"Most boys did not laugh\\" is a statement providing information about a group of boys and their reaction to an event, situation, or joke. Depending on the context in which the sentence is used, it could be a response to a question, a description of a scene, or even a comment on the boys' preferences or behavior. Overall, the sentence is pragmatically appropriate. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Most boys did not laugh\\" meets the strictest standards in terms of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, making it a correct sentence according to linguists. However, language is flexible, and usage may vary across different communities and contexts. It's essential to consider factors like context, audience, and purpose when evaluating the correctness of a sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Possible answers: feeling detached, feeling lazy, feeling smart A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Jan could be best described as feeling smart. The information given pertains to Jan's decision to turn their car into the driveway for the purpose of making some repairs. This choice demonstrates a number of character traits that align with the concept of being \\"smart.\\" First, it showcases Jan as being resourceful. Instead of immediately resorting to a professional mechanic for the repairs, which could potentially cost a lot of money, Jan opts to do it themselves. This demonstrates a degree of financial wisdom and practicality, characteristics often associated with intelligence. Secondly, this action implies that Jan possesses certain technical skills or knowledge related to car repair. The ability to handle car maintenance independently indicates a level of competence and know-how, which could be interpreted as smartness, as it involves understanding the workings of a complex machine like a car. Furthermore, deciding to repair the car indicates a proactive approach, suggesting that Jan takes initiative. Instead of ignoring the problem, or leaving it for later, they confront the issue directly. This sense of responsibility and foresight are qualities often attributed to smart individuals. In comparison, the other options given—\\"feeling detached\\" and \\"feeling lazy\\"—don't seem to match the information presented about Jan's actions. There's no indication that Jan is disinterested or indifferent about their circumstances, which would be suggested by \\"feeling detached.\\" Similarly, the fact that they take active steps to repair their car counters the notion of them \\"feeling lazy.\\" Overall, given the context, \\"feeling smart\\" seems to be the best choice to describe Jan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A student 'terrified' holidaymakers as he hurled abuse at passengers and cabin crew and swung from seats while on board a packed flight to Ibiza. Muscular Kyle Bent began shouting at a fellow passenger as the aeroplane came into land on the Spanish party island, before threatening staff on the Thomas Cook flight. The 25-year-old personal trainer has been jailed for 10 weeks after he admitted two public order offences in relation to his behaviour on the plane in July this year. Abuse: Kyle Bent, 25, left passengers 'terrified' as he hurled abuse at holidaymakers and cabin crew on board a flight to Ibiza. Jailed: The student and personal trainer yelled at magistrates 'You have ruined my life' as he was sentenced to 10 weeks in prison. As magistrates doled out his sentence, Bent screamed at them 'you have ruined my life' before he was led away to the cells. Trafford Magistrates' Court heard how passengers on the late-night flight from Manchester felt threatened by Bent's outburst. Lauren Costello, prosecuting, said: 'This case is brought on the basis of the defendant’s disgraceful behaviour to passengers and cabin crew who all felt threatened and worried. In the confines of an aeroplane there was no space to escape from him.' During the safety briefing, Bent, a Manchester Metropolitan University student was described as ‘boisterous and excited’. Boisterous: During the safety briefing Bent was described as 'boisterous and excited', and on take-off struggled to remain still. On take-off, he struggled to keep still and began shouting ‘inane’ comments to his friends. Ross Stafford, a teacher on the flight, had kindly swapped seats with Bent so the defendant could be closer to his friends. However, after feeling a force on the back of his seat and turning round, Bent swore at him. When Mr Stafford told him to calm down he swore again before adding: 'Look at what you’re wearing, you look like a grandad, what have you got on? Watch what you’re saying.' Mr Stafford was so scared he moved seats, only for Bent to then turn on the cabin crew. On board: Bent had been travelling from Manchester airport to Ibiza on the Thomas Cook flight. When flight attendant Lisa Cahill urged him to fasten his seatbelt for landing, he refused, swore at her and began swinging from the seat rests in the aisle. He was again asked to sit down, only to swear again, adding: 'Your breath stinks, stop talking to me little girl.' Bent was asked for his passport so his details could be recorded but he refused, swore, and threatened the attendant and her family. Bent, from Victoria Park, Manchester, admitted two public order offences of using threatening or abusive behaviour when he appeared before the court. Karl Miles, mitigating, said: 'Mr Bent proffers his apologies for his behaviour. He has remorse and regret for what happened on that flight.' Destination: The late-night flight had been packed with holidaymakers headed for the Spanish island of Ibiza (file picture) Mr Miles said Bent suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Jailing Bent for 10 weeks, Anne Marie Evans, chairman of the bench, told Bent: 'Your behaviour during a flight full of passengers seems to have terrified everybody.' As he was taken down Bent shouted at the bench: ‘You have ruined my life’. After the hearing, Pc Steve Thompson, airport community beat officer who helped catch Bent on his return from Ibiza, said: 'Anti-social behaviours will not be tolerated in any form. 'Greater Manchester Police will go to any lengths to apprehend an offender and bring him to justice. 'Even if they leave the country we will be ready for them when they get back.'

It also introduces other recurring characters such as Drake's little sister Megan (played by Miranda Cosgrove), who is notorious for playing pranks on the boys. The show continued to be successful, airing for four seasons until it came to an end on September 16, 2007, after a total of 57 episodes plus 4 additional specials. The program was known for its humor, interesting plot-line, and the chemistry of its main characters, helping it to gain a substantial fan base that remains active even after the series' conclusion. After the show's ending, both Drake Bell and Josh Peck continued to have successful acting careers. Miranda Cosgrove, who played the mischievous younger sister Megan, went on to star in another Dan Schneider-created Nickelodeon show, \\"iCarly\\". So, in short, the first episode of Drake and Josh aired on 11th January 2004, kick-starting a beloved sitcom that continued to entertain audiences for several years. It has pushed the acting careers of its main stars and is remembered fondly by its target audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Objective: Shed Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following. [-] can be used to smoke cigarettes [-] can be used to smoke slamon","completion":"To determine which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning, I'll analyze each option step by step and justify my reasoning. Option 1: Can be used to smoke cigarettes Step 1: Consider the primary use of a shed: A shed is typically used for storage or as a workspace for various activities such as gardening or woodworking. Step 2: Analyze the proposed function: Smoking cigarettes in a shed may be possible, depending on the shed's ventilation and the presence of combustible substances inside. Step 3: Assess the risks: If proper precautions are not taken, smoking cigarettes in a shed may present a fire hazard, especially if flammable materials (e.g., gasoline, paint, etc.) are stored inside. Option 2: Can be used to smoke salmon Step 1: Consider the primary use of a shed: As mentioned earlier, a shed is typically used for storage or as a workspace for various activities. Step 2: Analyze the proposed function: Smoking salmon in a shed may be feasible if the shed is properly equipped with a food smoker or modified to accommodate one. Step 3: Assess the risks: Smoking salmon in a shed may present some risks, such as fire hazards or food contamination, if proper safety measures are not taken. Based on the analysis of both options, I conclude that using a shed to smoke salmon is a more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. This is because the primary function of a shed aligns more closely with the proposed function of smoking salmon, as both involve using the shed as a workspace to complete a task. Smoking cigarettes in a shed, on the other hand, presents more potential risks due to the presence of flammable materials and improper ventilation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Cuban American who is accused of espionage pleads innocent. OPTIONS: A. yes. B. no. Question: Can we infer the following? American accused of espionage","completion":"In this scenario, a Cuban American is accused of espionage and pleads innocent. To address whether we can infer that an American is accused of espionage, we must first break down the components of the question and analyze the situation further. Firstly, the term \\"Cuban American\\" refers to a person who has both Cuban and American roots. This dual heritage can manifest in various ways, such as having Cuban-born parents and being born on American soil, being born in Cuba and later obtaining American citizenship, or being a first or second-generation descendant of Cuban immigrants to the United States. This means that the accused individual, as a Cuban American, has connections to both the Cuban and American nationalities. However, the question focuses on the claim of the Cuban American being accused of espionage, specifically in the American context. Espionage generally refers to the act of spying to obtain secret or classified information about another nation, organization, or individual. In this instance, the Cuban American, regardless of their dual heritage, is being accused of espionage which involves the United States in some capacity. Given these factors, we can infer that an American is accused of espionage. While the accused individual does possess Cuban roots, they are also an American by virtue of their Cuban American identity. Thus, the circumstance of a Cuban American being accused of espionage does indeed involve an American facing such allegations. This aligns with the statement in the question \\"American accused of espionage,\\" which we can concur with based on the provided information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Help as much as you can. Q:I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one? Answer:","completion":"The text refers to the category of \\"animal.\\" Specifically, Cleoeromene is a genus of moths, which are a type of insect. Therefore, the reference falls under the animal kingdom or fauna in biological classification. While humans often use the term \\"animal\\" to refer to mammals, biologically speaking, it extends to a wide range of creatures in the kingdom Animalia, including everything from insects like moths to mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, etc. The categorization of moths under \\"animals\\" makes sense when one understands the primary categories of life according to biological taxonomy. These fundamental categories begin with the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Within the Eukarya domain, which includes organisms with complex cells, we find the kingdom Animalia. This kingdom includes creatures with certain shared characteristics, including multi-cellular bodies, the capability of movement at some stage of life, heterotrophic (they consume other organisms for sustenance), and a specific, complex method of reproduction and development. Inside the kingdom Animalia, there is further classification into phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species - these rankings demonstrate the evolutionary relationships and shared characteristics between animals. In this context, Cleoeromene is a genus within the Crambidae family, which is a part of the order Lepidoptera - the insect order that includes both butterflies and moths. This detailed classification process is a tool that scientists use to understand the vast diversity of the animal kingdom. So, in conclusion, Cleoeromene is related to the category of \\"animal\\" among the given options. Moths are insects, and insects are a large and diverse group of animals.

Use evidence from the fact that if a tree is cut down then that tree will die to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"If a tree is cut down what will happen to it?\\" Pick your answer from: -- vitality extinguishing; -- growth; -- vigor; -- life;","completion":"When a tree is cut down, it experiences a significant and irreversible impact on its biological functions, leading to its eventual death. Among the options provided, \\"vitality extinguishing\\" best represents the outcome of a tree being cut down. When a tree is felled, it loses its ability to photosynthesize - the process by which trees and other plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This loss is due to the removal of leaves and branches, which contain chlorophyll, necessary for the absorption of sunlight. Consequently, energy production is disrupted, and the tree cannot sustain its growth, repair any damage, or carry out other essential biological processes. Moreover, cutting down a tree disrupts its ability to transport nutrients and water. Trees have a complex vascular system - xylem and phloem - that delivers essential nutrients, minerals, and water throughout the plant. Severing the trunk obstructs these pathways, leading to a depletion of nutrients, and eventually causing the tree to wither and die. Furthermore, the disruption of a tree's vascular system exposes it to harmful pathogens and pests, which can lead to accelerated decay and death. In addition, the root system of a tree is also affected when it is cut down. Roots not only anchor a tree to the ground but also play a vital role in the absorption of water and nutrients from soil. However, with the tree's death, roots lose their ability to obtain resources, compromising the tree's overall health further. In conclusion, cutting down a tree results in the loss of its ability to photosynthesize, transport nutrients and water, and maintain a healthy root system. All of these factors contribute to the \\"vitality extinguishing\\" of the tree, ultimately leading to its death."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ian is making a pool party for Neil and needs to raise pH in a pool, so Available options: A). Ian buys pH raising preparates.. B). Neil buys pH raising preparates..","completion":"A). Ian buys pH raising preparates.. After a detailed brainstorming session, Ian decides that he should be the one to take responsibility for raising the pH level of the pool. After all, he's the host of the party and it would be unbecoming to impose such a task on the guest of honor, Neil. So, Ian starts to research how to effectively raise the pH in a pool. Ian finds out that making changes to the pool's pH level is not a task that should be taken lightly, as the pH level of the pool affects bather comfort and the efficiency of the disinfection process. A bit of extra knowledge and understanding of water chemistry can be key to maintaining a healthy and balanced swimming pool. Ian learns that the ideal pH level for a pool is typically between 7.4 and 7.6. Too low a pH level indicates acidity, which can cause issues such as skin irritation for swimmers and potential damage to the pool equipment. A high pH level indicates that the water is too alkaline, which can cause cloudy water and reduce the effectiveness of chlorine. To raise the pH level, Ian needs to purchase a pH increaser, also known as a pH plus or pH up product. These are typically soda ash (sodium carbonate) or sodium bicarbonate, which are alkaline substances that neutralize the acidity in the pool water. Ian decides to visit a local pool supply store to get the materials needed. In the store, Ian meets with a pool expert who gives him more insight about using pH raising preparates. Ian learns that it's crucial to add these chemicals gradually, so as to avoid drastically altering the water pH, which could result in a condition known as pH bounce. On the day of the party, Ian wakes up early to prepare the pool. He doses the pool according to the instructions on the pH increaser package. After adding the product, Ian uses a pool testing kit to ensure that the pH of the water is ideal. If it's not, Ian continues the process, following the instructions and testing the water until the desired pH level is achieved. Throughout the party, Ian makes sure to periodically test the pool water to ensure the pH level stays within the ideal range. This ensures that the comfort of Neil and all the other guests remains top priority throughout the event. If Ian had chosen option B, and Neil had bought the pH raising preparates, the story might have unfolded differently. Neil may not have had an in-depth understanding of water chemistry or been aware of the importance of maintaining pH levels, leading to potential discomfort for the party guests, or damage to the pool. By taking on the responsibility himself, Ian ensured not only the success of his pool party but also Neil's comfort and enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fearing for her own newborn son's safety, Yocheved places him in a basket afloat on the Nile River, not before bidding him farewell with a final but powerful lullaby. Miriam follows the basket to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Queen Tuya, who names him Moses. Years later, Moses and his brother Rameses are scolded by their father for accidentally destroying a temple during one of their youthful misadventures, though Moses tries to take the blame. That evening at a palace banquet, Seti, who wants to give Rameses the opportunity to prove that he is responsible, names him Prince Regent and gives him authority over Egypt's temples. As a tribute, the high priests Hotep and Huy offer him a beautiful young Midianite woman, Tzipporah, and Rameses gives her to Moses. Rameses then appoints him Royal Chief Architect. Later that evening, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace and runs into his siblings Miriam and Aaron. Miriam is overjoyed to see her younger brother again, but Aaron is fearful to watch the confrontation. Despite Aaron's attempts to protect his sister, Miriam tries to tell Moses about his past, but he refuses to listen. Miriam then sings her mother's lullaby, which causes Moses to remember the melody. Moses runs to the palace, eager to return to familiar surroundings. The truth about his past is later confirmed by a nightmare, and finally by Seti himself. The next morning, Moses accidentally pushes an Egyptian guard off the scaffolding of the temple when trying to stop him from whipping a Hebrew slave, and the guard falls to his death.

Two adults and two children were killed in an apparent murder-suicide Sunday at an apartment building in California's Central Valley, while a fifth person was hospitalized in critical condition, police said. Police were called to investigate a disturbance at the Fresno home shortly before 7 a.m. They found a man outside the apartment suffering from a stab wound, The Fresno Bee reported ( http://bit.ly/ACSNqA). Capt. Dennis Bridges told the newspaper that officers then heard a single gunshot. When they went inside the apartment, they found a woman believed to be in her 20s with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a man in his 20s or 30s dead of a gunshot wound. Two children _ an 18-month-old and a 3-year-old _ also died from gunshot wounds. \\"We're investigating to determine exactly how the children and the adult male died and the circumstances around the man suffering from a stab wound,\\" Bridges said. He did not know if there was a history of domestic violence calls or other disturbances at the apartment. The man suffering from the stab wound was taken to a local hospital, where he was reported to be in critical condition. A neighbor, Eric Gonzalez, described the residents of the apartment as a \\"normal\\" family. \\"I never saw them fighting. They would come out with the baby carriage, and the man was taking care of his children,\\" he told an Associated Press reporter outside the apartment complex. Gonzalez said he did not hear any fighting or gunshots before the incident. Police didn't immediately return calls from the AP seeking additional information. ___ Information from: The Fresno Bee, http://www.fresnobee.com ||||| Fresno police were trying Sunday to unravel a tragic mystery at a southeast Fresno apartment complex: What led to the shooting deaths of four people in a spree that ended with the mother of two of the young victims killing herself as police were at the door. A disturbance call at 6:44 a.m. Sunday led officers to a man with a stab wound just outside a ground-floor unit at the Silver Lake Apartments on East Belmont Avenue, near Clovis Avenue, police Capt. Dennis Bridges said. As officers provided aid to the man, they learned that children were inside the apartment, Bridges said. Officers at the front door were weighing whether to enter the apartment when they heard a single gunshot inside. That's when they rushed in and found a woman in her 20s, who they believe is the stabbing victim's wife, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Bridges said. The couple's two children, an 18-month-old girl and a 3-year-old boy, also were found with fatal gunshot wounds. In the kitchen, police found a man in his 20s or 30s also shot to death. Police did not reveal his relationship to the family, or say where the mother and her children were found in the apartment. Police did not identify the victims. The injured man, whose age was not known, was taken to Community Regional Medical Center, where he was reported in critical condition. One neighbor, Jaime Sosa, said the man appeared to be alert when paramedics were treating him. Bridges said investigators were trying to determine what happened -- and why. \\"We're investigating to determine exactly how the children and the adult male died and the circumstances around the man suffering from a stab wound,\\" Bridges said. Police said they expected to release more information today. Bridges did not know whether there was a history of domestic violence calls or other disturbances at the apartment in the past. Neighbors, though, said they had not seen or heard of any problems at that apartment. The couple, their two children and the woman's cousin had lived in the apartment for about four years, neighbors said. The gated apartment complex has manicured lawns, mature trees and a play area for children in the rear of the complex where the family lived. Neighbors say the family kept to themselves, but the father and his children often were seen playing on the small playground. About a dozen people waited behind police tape at 4 p.m. to watch investigators remove the bodies from the first-floor apartment. Red icicle lights still hung from the front awning and on a side bush. Resident Eric Gonzalez watched in disbelief. He didn't know the family well, but ran into the husband several times in the laundry room or in passing on the apartment grounds. \\"They were nice people,\\" Gonzalez said. \\"The husband and wife seemed like they were in love with each other.\\" The reporter can be reached at blee@fresnobee.com or (559) 441-6495.

She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves.

That's when he discovered the victims. According to Seattle fire 911 records, medics responded to 4423 15th Avenue Northeast around 9:30 a.m. The Malloy Apartments is a 123-unit building made up of mostly studio and small one-bedroom units. The incident was originally reported as a stabbing. UW police sent out a campus-wide alert warning students to avoid the area just before 9:30 a.m. \\"Homicide investigators are on scene and actively working to determine the circumstances of this case, and whether there are any outstanding individuals involved in this incident,\\" Seattle police wrote in a bulletin Tuesday morning. The King County Medical Examiner will determine the cause and manner of death. There hasn't been a double-homicide in the University District in at least 10 years.

Just two weeks later she has been found dead in her apartment along with the body of her roommate Thiti-orn Chotchuangsap. The only daughter and youngest child in her family, Kornkamol returned home early last month to celebrate Mother’s Day on August 12 with her father and older brothers; her mother had already passed away. Seattle police are investigating the murders of both Washington University post-graduate students. Reports of the killings detailed how the victims’ bodies were riddled with knife wounds, causing alarm in Seattle that such a vicious act could occur in the quiet residential area close to the university and in a city regarded as one of the safest in the United States. Kornkamol was studying law in Seattle, having graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Thammasat University and attained a master’s degree, also in law, from a university in Boston, Massachusetts. Her family lives in Pathum Thani province, where they are well known, due to some of them being local politicians. They say Kornkamol’s ultimate goal was to one day become a judge. The only information to have emerged so far about Thiti-orn is that she was from Samut Sakhon province. Deputy immigration police commissioner Itthipon Itthisarnronnachai said yesterday he had been notified that both bodies had been discovered on Tuesday bearing multiple stab wounds. He declined to speculate on details surrounding the deaths, in particular on speculation in US media reports that this was a murder or murder-suicide. The murder-suicide theory was raised following a report that the apartment was locked from the inside when a building manager went to check it at the request of Kornkamon’s family, made through their relative in the US. Kornkamol contacted her family almost daily, so they were immediately concerned after they failed to reach her and university administration officers told them she had been absent from class for many days. Ittipon confirmed the report that the room was locked from the inside when the building manager tried to gain entry, apparently adding substance to the theory there was nobody else involved. Moreover US police have declared that they are not seeking any suspects. Speaking at the same press conference, Pol Lt General Suthipong Wongpin, immigration police commissioner, said immigration records showed that Kornkamol had left Thailand on August 21 and Thiti-orn on August 27. Immigration police will liaise with relevant authorities to help the families of both women travel to the US. An elder brother of Kornkamol, Weerasak Leenavarat, said that his family is in deep mourning for the loss of their friendly and lively daughter and sister.

Speaking at the same press conference, Pol Lt General Suthipong Wongpin, immigration police commissioner, said immigration records showed that Kornkamol had left Thailand on August 21 and Thiti-orn on August 27. Immigration police will liaise with relevant authorities to help the families of both women travel to the US. An elder brother of Kornkamol, Weerasak Leenavarat, said that his family is in deep mourning for the loss of their friendly and lively daughter and sister. It was especially traumatic, he said, for their father, whose health was already poor. The rest of the family is now staying close to take special care of him at this time. Weerasak posted a series of photos on his Facebook page of the day Kornkamol flew to the US. The images show everybody smiling as they see off a beaming Kornkamol at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Weerasak called Kornkamol “our little sister who was always lively, friendly and brave”. A relative wrote that the last words Kornkamol told her were: “Don’t be so sad. I will only go to the US for a short period. I will come back very soon.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Two women in their 20s were found dead inside an apartment in the University District near the University of Washington in Seattle.

Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The tone of this product review is mostly positive.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.
