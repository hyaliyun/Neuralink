Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman.

Gatty, 52, said he was forced to take such drastic action after he accidentally went into a crocodile-infested area of Queensland. He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going, as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue. Gatty said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it. His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback. Dazed and bleeding, he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home. It was only when he regained his senses he realized that he had been taken into crocodile-infested area. \\"I had to get off the horse and I fell straight into a crocodile nest,\\" he told reporters. \\"That frightened me. I couldn't go back, it was too far and too dangerous, so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there, hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did.\\" Gatty explained how each night two crocodiles would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him. Although Gatty's two sandwiches ran out after three days, he was able to get running water during the day and knew rescuers were looking for him as he could see helicopters in the air above his tree. \\"If I hadn't seen the crocs circling me, and if I hadn't fallen into the croc nest, I would have made a push for it.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do I prepare for BITSAT 2017 seriously? How should I prepare for BITSAT examination 2017?","completion":"While the two questions are similar in intent, they do not have the exact same meaning. Both questions are asking for advice or guidance on preparing for the Birla Institute of Technology and Science Admission Test (BITSAT) in 2017. However, there is a slight difference in emphasis: 1) \\"How do I prepare for BITSAT 2017 seriously?\\" This question assumes that the person asking is looking for a serious or intensive approach to their preparation. They may be especially concerned about dedicating proper time and resources to their preparation and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the exam material. They may also be implying a sense of urgency and commitment in their intention to prepare. 2) \\"How should I prepare for BITSAT examination 2017?\\" This question is more generic and could encompass serious and intensive preparation, but it could also include a more casual or flexible approach. The person asking may simply expect information about the possible approaches and strategies one could take towards BITSAT preparation. However, the advice for both questions could be quite similar. The primary difference may lie in the emphasis placed on the seriousness of one's intentions. Here is a detailed answer that could apply to both questions: 1. Understand the exam pattern and syllabus: Start by familiarizing yourself with the BITSAT exam pattern, which includes the number of questions, type of questions, duration, and marking scheme. Then, study the syllabus to understand which topics need to be covered for Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and English Proficiency & Logical Reasoning. 2. Create a study plan: Based on the syllabus and your understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, create a personalized study plan. Allocate time for each subject and topic, ensuring that you devote enough time to focus on your weaker areas. Set milestones and goals each week and revise the plan based on your progress. 3. Gather study materials: Compile a list of essential textbooks and reference books for the subjects included in BITSAT. Also, consider using online resources such as video lectures, blogs, and tutorials. If needed, enroll in a coaching institute or seek help from a tutor to guide you through the preparation process. 4. Master the basics: Start by building a strong foundation for each subject, focusing on understanding the fundamental concepts. Constant practice is vital, so solve as many problems as possible. Strengthen your theoretical knowledge by going through solved examples and explanations in textbooks. 5. Take mock tests and solve sample papers: The more practice tests and sample papers you solve, the better you'll understand the BITSAT exam pattern and your own performance. Regular assessments will give you an idea of the topics you need to improve on and allow you to fine-tune your strategies. 6. Revise and revisit: Regular revision is essential to retain information and reinforce your understanding of the concepts. Create short, summarized notes for each topic to help you quickly review the key points. Go back and revisit difficult topics or questions regularly to build your confidence. 7. Strengthen your time management skills: Given that BITSAT is a timed exam, it's crucial to develop effective time management strategies. During practice sessions, set a timer to simulate the exam scenario and learn how to allocate sufficient time to each question. Skip the time-consuming or challenging questions initially and return to them after completing those you are more comfortable with. 8. Focus on English Proficiency & Logical Reasoning: Don't overlook the English Proficiency & Logical Reasoning sections of the exam. Enhance your vocabulary and improve your grammatical skills, and practice logical reasoning questions through puzzles, quizzes, and other sources. 9. Stay healthy and maintain a balanced lifestyle: To optimize your performance, take care of your physical and mental health. Maintain a well-balanced diet, get regular exercise, and ensure adequate sleep. Make time for breaks and recreational activities to prevent burnout or stress. 10. Stay consistent and motivated: Remember that consistency is key when preparing for BITSAT. Stay disciplined and follow your study plan diligently. Stay motivated by setting goals, rewarding yourself when you reach milestones, and seeking support from family, friends, or mentors. By following these recommendations, you will be well-prepared for the BITSAT exam in 2017."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

How can the drive from Edmonton to Auckland be described, and how do these cities' attractions compare to those in Hamilton? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Task: Of the two questions provided, the first question focuses on the history of Edmonton, Auckland, and Ottawa, whereas the second question focuses on the attractions of Edmonton, Auckland, and Hamilton. Therefore, the questions are different. Now, we shall provide answers to both questions. Question 1: How can the drive from Edmonton to Auckland be described, and how does the history of these cities compare and contrast to the history of Ottawa? Answer: The drive from Edmonton to Auckland cannot be described accurately, as these cities are not connected by roads. Edmonton is located in Alberta, Canada, and Auckland is in New Zealand. Travel between these two destinations would typically involve flying. Edmonton, Auckland, and Ottawa all have distinct histories. Edmonton, founded in 1795, grew as a trading center because of its proximity to natural resources. It played a key role in Alberta's economic development and became the provincial capital in 1905. Edmonton's history has revolved largely around resource extraction and trade, particularly in the oil industry. Auckland, founded in 1840, is New Zealand's largest city. Its history has been shaped by both indigenous Maori culture and its colonization by the British Empire. Auckland was the capital city of New Zealand before the capital was shifted to Wellington in 1865. Auckland has grown into a multicultural hub influenced by diverse European, Maori, and Polynesian communities. Ottawa, located in Ontario, Canada, was founded in 1826. Initially a lumber town, it was chosen as the capital of the Province of Canada by Queen Victoria in 1857 to help resolve regional conflicts between English and French Canadians. Ottawa later became the capital of Canada when the country was created in 1867. The city's history is unique due to the prominence of bilingualism and the ongoing effort to balance French and English Canadian interests. Question 2: How can the drive from Edmonton to Auckland be described, and how do these cities' attractions compare to those in Hamilton? Answer: As previously mentioned, the drive from Edmonton to Auckland cannot be described accurately, as these cities are not connected by roads. Traveling between Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, and Auckland, in New Zealand, would typically involve flying. In terms of attractions, the three cities offer unique experiences for visitors. Edmonton: Known as \\"Canada's Festival City,'' Edmonton hosts numerous cultural events and festivals. Key attractions include the West Edmonton Mall, the largest shopping mall in North America, and the thriving arts district with its numerous theatres and galleries. Nature lovers can explore the North Saskatchewan River Valley with its extensive system of parks and trails. Auckland: This coastal city has a vibrant music and arts scene, with galleries, theaters, and live music venues, as well as beautiful beaches and parks. The city offers several iconic attractions like the Sky Tower, Auckland War Memorial Museum, and the Viaduct Harbour. Auckland also boasts a rich culinary scene, showcasing the cultural diversity of the city. Hamilton: Located in Ontario, Canada, Hamilton is known for its natural beauty and outdoor activities. It has over 100 waterfalls within its boundaries, including the popular Webster's Falls, Tiffany Falls, and Albion Falls. The city is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, which is one of Canada's largest botanical gardens. Additionally, Hamilton's thriving arts scene features galleries, live music, and theater performances. The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum is another highlight, showcasing a range of vintage military aircraft. In conclusion, while both questions mention Edmonton and Auckland, they focus on different aspects - history and attractions - and involve distinct comparisons with Ottawa and Hamilton, respectively. As a result, the two questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

So when you eat the strawberries with the sugar, they will be less sour. But if we put water on the strawberries, it won't really change how they taste.

The paragraph provides a brief overview of the premise and setting of the Higher Ground TV series. It mentions that the series revolves around at-risk teenagers attending Mount Horizon High School, a therapeutic boarding school, and their struggle with personal issues related to addiction, abuse, and disorders. Because these topics can be considered sensitive to some viewers, one might argue that the show does discuss controversial topics. However, it is also necessary to consider that the paragraph does not provide enough information about the series' specific content, presentation, or public reception, which could give more context to whether it genuinely deals with controversial themes. For example, it is not apparent if the series takes a provocative or unconventional stance on the mentioned issues or if it portrays them in a way that might stir up debate among audiences. Furthermore, the term \\"controversial\\" can vary across different viewers, cultures, and perspectives. What can be considered controversial to one person may not be the same for someone else.

Summarize this article: U.S. And Philippines To End 117-Year-Old Feud As Church Bells Return This week the United States and the Philippines end a 117-year-old feud. Church bells carted off by American soldiers during the U.S.-Philippines War will be formally handed in at a Manila air base. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: This week, the United States and the Philippines end a 117-year-old feud over church bells. American soldiers seized the bells during the U.S.-Philippines War. And now those bells will be formally returned at a Manila air base. NPR's Julie McCarthy traveled to the hometown of the bells and has this story. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Folklore of Balangiga... (SOUNDBITE OF BELLS RINGING) MCCARTHY: ...Holds that the clanging today from the belfry of St. Lawrence the Martyr Church is nothing compared to the tolling of the heavy bells the Americans carted off as war booty during the U.S.-Philippine War. When the United States formally hands them back more than a century later, it will right a wrong for this quaint town in a frenzy about recovering the pilfered bells. Resident Fe Campanero says time has not diminished their meaning. FE CAMPANERO: They represent our quest for freedom. They represent our courage. They represent our faith. MCCARTHY: The United States succeeded Spain as the new colonial power. Fighting flared across the country as Filipino nationalists fought for independence. Historian Xiao Chua says the death toll from what he calls the forgotten war was staggering. XIAO CHUA: People do not remember that a lot of people died. Hundreds of thousands were killed. MCCARTHY: It was 1901 when Balangiga put itself in the crosshairs, staging an attack against American soldiers occupying the town. And signaling the start of the uprising, the church bells. Fe Campanero is the descendant of the only woman who participated in the plot. The night before the assault, men disguised as women crept past unsuspecting soldiers. The next morning, bells pealing, Campanero's great-great-aunt charged from the church. CAMPANERO: She was waving the rosary beads around, signaling the guerrillas to go for the attack. MCCARTHY: The native fighters killed 48 U.S. servicemen - two-thirds of the unit - the bloodiest defeat of the U.S. since Custer's Last Stand 25 years earlier. Americans called it a massacre and launched a chilling retaliation. A kill order went out for all Filipino males 10 years old and above. The more you kill and burn, General Jacob Smith famously told his men, the more you please me. But Chua says the most credible accounts suggest that the Americans did not wantonly kill civilians. Rather, they destroyed everything else. CHUA: Because they were still mad, they burned the village, they killed the animals, they burned more crops. Basically, the whole of Samar was turned into howling wilderness. MCCARTHY: From the charred St. Lawrence Church, the Americans carted off three bells - war booty, not melted down for munitions. Two bells have been at a U.S. Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyo., and the third with the U.S. Army in Korea. Veterans in Wyoming put up stiff resistance to their return, but retired Navy Captain Dennis Wright argues that any U.S. claim on the basis of some deep attachment is suspect. He says the Wyoming bells sat unnoticed in a warehouse for decades. And researchers now believe it was the bell housed in Korea that signaled the Filipino attack. Wright says the U.S. has returned many bells from other conflicts. CAPTAIN DENNIS WRIGHT: These are about the only bells that people didn't want to relinquish. But church bells just belong in churches. They don't commemorate military deeds. MCCARTHY: Speaking in Wyoming last month, Defense Secretary James Mattis tried to assuage those who fear that the U.S. loses something returning the bells. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMES MATTIS: Please hear me when I say that bells mark time, but courage is timeless. MCCARTHY: Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel Romualdez says his country doesn't begrudge those who don't want the bells returned. They saw them as a symbol of sacrifice, he says. Romualdez reflects on the handover with optimism for the sometimes-tense U.S.-Philippine relationship. Rattled by China's inroads into the Philippines, he bats away questions about whether returning the bells now might be part of a U.S. thrust to use goodwill gestures to counter Chinese influence. Whatever the reason, he says, the bottom line is... JOSE MANUEL ROMUALDEZ: The return of these bells will really give both countries a renewed friendship and mutual respect. (SOUNDBITE OF CEMENT SANDING) MCCARTHY: Workmen are busy burnishing Balangiga for the homecoming of its iconic bells. Resident Fe Campanero says it's time to put painful memories in the past. CAMPANERO: We cannot rewrite history, but we can end this story with a beautiful note. MCCARTHY: Everyone, she says, is a winner. Julie McCarthy, NPR News, Balangiga.

(Associated Press) Philippine government officials inspect three church bells seized by American troops as war trophies more than a century ago, as they were returned to the Philippines Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2018 in suburban Pasay city, southeast of Manila, Philippines. American occupation troops took the bells in 1901 from... (Associated Press) MANILA, Philippines (AP) — For over a century, the Bells of Balangiga have not rung in the Philippines, a silence that the president last year called \\"painful.\\" Now, the revered bells will once again be heard in the country. Hundreds of Filipino villagers in 1901, armed with bolos and disguised as women, used one of Balangiga town's church bells to signal the start of a massive attack that wrought one of the bloodiest single-battle losses of American occupation forces in the Philippines. The U.S. Army brutally retaliated, reportedly killing thousands of villagers, as the Philippine-American War raged. After the violence, the Americans took three church bells as spoils of war that Filipinos would demand for decades to be handed back. On Tuesday, a giant U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft brought the Bells of Balangiga back to the Philippine capital in a poignant ceremony that saw U.S. defense officials and the American ambassador to Manila return the war relics 117 years after they were seized. A military brass band played the Philippine national anthem, followed by \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" The treaty allies then swept aside a dark episode in their long relationship with joint photographs and handshakes. \\"It is my great honor to be here at this closing of a painful chapter in our history,\\" U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim said. \\"Our relationship has withstood the tests of history and flourishes today.\\" U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said the handover is an important gesture of friendship and is in America's national security interest. Some U.S. veterans and officials had opposed the return of the bells, calling them memorials to American war dead. At Tuesday's handover ceremony at a Philippine air force base, the bronze bells stood atop a red platform like silent symbols of a bygone era of hostilities, as American and Philippine flags flapped in the wind. Officials from both sides called for a minute of silence for the war dead. The bells are revered by Filipinos as symbols of national pride, and their arrival on a U.S. C-130 plane and the ceremony were shown live on national TV. Two of the bells had been displayed for decades at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the third was with the U.S. Army in South Korea. After being colonized by Spain for more than three centuries, the Philippines became a U.S. possession in 1898 in a new colonial era that began with the outbreak of the Philippine-American War. American occupation troops seized the bells from a Catholic church following an attack by machete-wielding Filipino villagers, who killed 48 U.S. soldiers in Balangiga, on central Samar island off Leyte Gulf, according to Filipino historian Rolando Borrinaga. The Americans retaliated, with a general, Jacob Smith, ordering troops to shoot villagers older than 10 and turn the island into a \\"howling wilderness,\\" Borrinaga said. Thousands of villagers were reported to have been killed. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has had an antagonistic attitude toward the U.S. and has revitalized ties with China and Russia, asked Washington in his state of the nation address last year to \\"return them to us, this is painful for us.\\" \\"Give us back those Balangiga bells. ... They are part of our national heritage,\\" Duterte said in the speech, attended by the U.S. ambassador and other diplomats. Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at Tuesday's ceremony that with the resolution of the issue, \\"It's time for healing, it is time for closure, it is time to look ahead as two nations should with a shared history as allies.\\" Duterte has referred to violence by Americans in Balangiga and on southern Jolo island in the early 1900s in public criticism of the U.S. government after it raised concerns about his brutal crackdown on illegal drugs in which thousands have died.

The bells were turned over by Sung Kim, the American ambassador, to the Philippine government, which had stepped up its efforts to recover the war artifacts since President Rodrigo Duterte took office two years ago. American troops seized the bells in 1901 from the town of Balangiga on Samar Island, where they went to avenge the death of 48 fellow soldiers killed in an attack by Filipino guerrillas on an American garrison. The American troops were under orders to turn the area into a “howling wilderness” by killing every male citizen age 10 or older and capable of bearing arms. The massacre was the deadliest of American troops since Col. George Armstrong Custer and his troops were slaughtered at the Battle of Little Bighorn 25 years earlier. ||||| Philippine government officials inspect three church bells seized by American troops as war trophies more than a century ago, as they were returned to the Philippines Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2018 in suburban... (Associated Press) Philippine government officials inspect three church bells seized by American troops as war trophies more than a century ago, as they were returned to the Philippines Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2018 in suburban Pasay city, southeast of Manila, Philippines. American occupation troops took the bells in 1901 from... (Associated Press) MANILA, Philippines (AP) — For over a century, the Bells of Balangiga have not rung in the Philippines, a silence that the president last year called \\"painful.\\" Now, the revered bells will once again be heard in the country. Hundreds of Filipino villagers in 1901, armed with bolos and disguised as women, used one of Balangiga town's church bells to signal the start of a massive attack that wrought one of the bloodiest single-battle losses of American occupation forces in the Philippines. The U.S. Army brutally retaliated, reportedly killing thousands of villagers, as the Philippine-American War raged. After the violence, the Americans took three church bells as spoils of war that Filipinos would demand for decades to be handed back. On Tuesday, a giant U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft brought the Bells of Balangiga back to the Philippine capital in a poignant ceremony that saw U.S. defense officials and the American ambassador to Manila return the war relics 117 years after they were seized. A military brass band played the Philippine national anthem, followed by \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" The treaty allies then swept aside a dark episode in their long relationship with joint photographs and handshakes. \\"It is my great honor to be here at this closing of a painful chapter in our history,\\" U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim said. \\"Our relationship has withstood the tests of history and flourishes today.\\" U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has said the handover is an important gesture of friendship and is in America's national security interest. Some U.S. veterans and officials had opposed the return of the bells, calling them memorials to American war dead. At Tuesday's handover ceremony at a Philippine air force base, the bronze bells stood atop a red platform like silent symbols of a bygone era of hostilities, as American and Philippine flags flapped in the wind. Officials from both sides called for a minute of silence for the war dead. The bells are revered by Filipinos as symbols of national pride, and their arrival on a U.S. C-130 plane and the ceremony were shown live on national TV. Two of the bells had been displayed for decades at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the third was with the U.S. Army in South Korea. After being colonized by Spain for more than three centuries, the Philippines became a U.S. possession in 1898 in a new colonial era that began with the outbreak of the Philippine-American War. American occupation troops seized the bells from a Catholic church following an attack by machete-wielding Filipino villagers, who killed 48 U.S. soldiers in Balangiga, on central Samar island off Leyte Gulf, according to Filipino historian Rolando Borrinaga. The Americans retaliated, with a general, Jacob Smith, ordering troops to shoot villagers older than 10 and turn the island into a \\"howling wilderness,\\" Borrinaga said. Thousands of villagers were reported to have been killed. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has had an antagonistic attitude toward the U.S. and has revitalized ties with China and Russia, asked Washington in his state of the nation address last year to \\"return them to us, this is painful for us.\\" \\"Give us back those Balangiga bells. ... They are part of our national heritage,\\" Duterte said in the speech, attended by the U.S. ambassador and other diplomats. Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at Tuesday's ceremony that with the resolution of the issue, \\"It's time for healing, it is time for closure, it is time to look ahead as two nations should with a shared history as allies.\\" Duterte has referred to violence by Americans in Balangiga and on southern Jolo island in the early 1900s in public criticism of the U.S. government after it raised concerns about his brutal crackdown on illegal drugs in which thousands have died. A breakthrough on the bells issue came with an amendment to a U.S. law banning the return of war relics and memorials to foreign countries. That allowed the homecoming of the Balanggiga bells, said Lorenzana, who saw the bells last year in Wyoming, where he was notified by Mattis of the U.S. decision.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Write highlights for this article: Britain will be accused by 180 Iraqis next week of breaching international law by torturing and killing prisoners during the controversial Iraq War. Lawyers representing the group - who claim they are victims of abuse or their family members were unlawfully killed - will accuse the UK of a 'systemic' policy of abuse committed between 2003 and 2008. The case - which will be heard in the High Court from January 29 - will see British soldiers and intelligence officers accused of unlawful interrogation practices. Controversial: Britain will be accused by 180 Iraqis next week of breaching international law by torturing and killing prisoners during the controversial Iraq War. Lawyers acting for the group will place a file of statements before two judges which details alleged use of 'stress positions' and hooding as well as beating, sexual abuse and religious abuse of illegally detained prisoners. Some of the claims made in the. statements are incredibly shocking with sexual depravity and insults to. Islam featuring strongly. In one case, a soldier is alleged to. have masturbated over a prisoner while another is alleged to have. committed sodomy with his finger. The High Court will also be told how. female interrogators stripped and feigned seduction in exchange for. information from prisoners. Worrying: The death of Baha Mousa, an innocent hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003, is just the tip of the iceberg, it will be claimed next week. He is pictured with his family. According to The Observer, the court. will hear that in some cases, the torture led to the death of a. prisoner. The claims come just weeks away from the 10th anniversary of the. war in Iraq. The court. will rule on whether the alleged abuses were isolated and were unaware. to commanders, politicians and senior Ministry of Defence officials or whether they were. authorised as policy. The statements from the group which will. be presented to the court were complied by human rights lawyer Phil. Shiner, from the Public Interest Lawyers group. He held meetings with victims and their relatives - mostly in Lebanon - were he heard the allegations of abuse. The Ministry of Defence has always maintained that issues around interrogation and detention during the Iraq War were dealt with at the inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa, an innocent hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003. Accuser: The statements from the group of Iraqis which will be presented to the court were complied by human rights lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, from the Public Interest Lawyers group. The driving forces behind the case at the High Court next week are a human rights lawyer and an author. The group of Iraqis who make the. allegations of abuse against British soldiers are represented by human. rights lawyer Phil Shiner. He works for the Birmingham-based. Public Interest Lawyers group and has a reputation for working on issues concerning international, environmental and human rights law. Mr Shiner has also written numerous articles on international and human rights law. Much of the evidence which will be heard. by the High Court next week was taken by him following meetings in the. Lebanon with the alleged victims and their families. He has previously accused the. Ministry of Defence (MoD) of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' to avoid accountability over the treatment of soldiers in Iraq. Speaking previously, he said: 'There must be a judicial inquiry into the UK's detention policy in south-east Iraq. 'The MoD has deployed every dirty. trick in the book to prevent accountability for the hundreds of torture. and unlawful killings cases of Iraqi civilians.' Mr Shiner also represented the victims in the Baha Mousa Public Inquiries. He was the 'Human Rights Lawyer of the Year' in 2004, as designated by Liberty and Justice. Andrew Williams, who is the. author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa, has also been campaigning for 'the truth' into allegations of abuse. He wrote A Very British Killing: The Death of Baha Mousa which was published in October last year. A description of the book claims it. tells the 'inside story' of the death and examines 'institutional. brutality' and a 'flawed military police inquiry' into the death. His. book claims that the death of Baha Mousa was not about 'a few bad men' or 'rotten apples'. The High Court hearing is scheduled over three days from January 29. The MOD also has its own internal probe into alleged abuse through its Iraq Historic Allegations Team. But Andrew Williams, who is the. author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa , told The Observer that his. death was just the tip of the iceberg. 'This. is the crucial moment of decision', he said. 'This is our last chance. to get to the truth of what happened. This is what we demand of others,. but we do not demand it of ourselves.' The court will be told of five 'state practices' which the lawyers will claim were 'unlawful, right to the top'. They claim illegal interrogation techniques were taught at Chicksands, near London, which is an army intelligence facility. Many. of the alleged incidents happened while prisoners were being held in. custody, although it will be claimed that some took place at people's. homes . Highlights:","completion":"1.

Plot title: King Solomon's Mines Movie plot: Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) hires Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because...

To ensure that Bockner will never enjoy the fruits of his treachery and to assert his own power, he forces Bockner to swallow a handful of the diamonds. As Bockner gasps and chokes on the precious stones, Dogati takes pleasure in torturing him, knowing that it not only physically pains Bockner but also symbolizes the wealth that will never truly be his.

Alan Bean is identified as a key figure within this data set. He is noted as a crew member of Apollo 12, which seems to suggest a profession in astrophysics, or more specifically, as an astronaut. Apollo 12, then, is corroborated as some sort of mission or project, presumably related to space exploration. Additional details could illuminate specific roles and responsibilities that Alan Bean undertook within the scope of Apollo 12, or significant milestones and achievements associated with his role. Alan Bean's nationality is revealed as the United States, indicating his country of origin or citizenship. His American nationality in conjunction with his involvement in Apollo 12 frames a broader schema around possible timelines, given that the era of American-led space exploration missions kicked off around the mid-20th Century. Furthermore, it may suggest a tie to the US government or a regulatory body, as they typically spearhead such national projects. His nationality and occupation as an astronaut may lay the groundwork for significant accomplishments and contributions in the field of space exploration for the American nation. Finally, the data reveals that the operator of Apollo 12 is NASA. This critical piece of information confirms several assumptions made earlier: Apollo 12 is indeed linked to space exploration, and in a more specific context, a space mission. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is a US government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and research. It is known worldwide for its space expeditions and its astronauts, who are deemed national heroes in the US. Given that Alan Bean was part of an Apollo 12 mission operated by NASA, we can safely infer that he had been intricately involved and played a significant role in the space exploration endeavors of the United States. In a broader snapshot, the data outlines an important part of American space exploration history and Alan Bean's key role in it as a crew member of Apollo 12 under the operation of NASA. His American nationality may imply that his contributions to the space mission not only helped escalate the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding of space but also elevated the national pride of the United States."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. \\"We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,\\" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams.

Yet the stress of living with massive amounts of debt from student loans, credit cards, medical treatments or bad real estate deals can weigh on someone so much that it feels like a physical burden. Brittany M. Powell, a San Francisco-based photographer, knows that weight firsthand. After a 15-year career as a commercial photographer, including stints for National Geographic, Powell wound up underemployed, paying most of her income toward her rent, and living off of credit cards for several years. In 2012, she finally filed for bankruptcy, another change that ultimately transformed her life. The experience, she said in an interview, taught her a lot about living with debt – how it is a shameful and private experience, but at the same time incredibly common in the U.S. “Many of us are in the same situation, but it’s not something that we collaboratively talk about,\\" Powell said. Though people don't often talk openly about it, living with tens of thousands of dollars of debt is now a common American experience. Families have more than twice as much debt than they did in the 1950s. Mortgages make up around 70 percent of household debt, while auto loans, credit cards, student loans and other categories account for the rest. Once Powell started talking openly about her own experience with debt, she found that many people were eager to share their similar experiences. Shortly thereafter, she began “The Debt Project,” her current effort to photograph 99 people across the U.S. and interview them about the role that debt plays in their lives. She has so far photographed about 50 of the 99 – a nod to Occupy Wall Street’s “99 percent” – in locations including San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit and rural Vermont. Powell says she spends about an hour chatting with her subjects about their experiences and photographs them in their houses. She also has them write a hand-written note to explain their amount of debt and how they acquired it next to each photo. (Click on the photos to enlarge them.) Powell, who also has talked to Slate about her photos, says the photo series was inspired by Flemish portrait paintings, in which the wealthy would have themselves painted with all their worldly possessions around them. The painting became a testament to their wealth, and a representation of their value. Here is one example of a wealthy Flemish couple, painted by Jan van Eyck in the 15th Century: But if debt is invisible, how do you photograph it? Powell realized that, by photographing indebted people in their households, she was also capturing their debt. In America today, our houses and our sofas are often imbued with debt. Even our careers and our healthy bodies are often made possible through taking on debt. “Possessions in this country really represent a part of ourselves,” she said in a phone interview. “For some people, those are acquired through debt in some indirect way. And for some people, they’re the reason they’re in debt.” She found that some readers have a negative reaction to the surroundings in their photograph – for example, saying they can’t be sympathetic to an indebted person with such a nice sofa. But Powell said she wants to make a portrait that is beautiful and empowering, and also capture the complex costs and benefits of taking on debt. Student loans can provide you with the potential for a better life, but also be the burden that keeps that better life from being realized. “[Debt] is something that we have the privilege of having the opportunity to use, but then we’re kind of enslaved by it afterwards,” Powell says. One of her interviewees, a freelance writer and teacher, expresses that feeling of privilege below: Powell also found that debt was highly associated with shame, in part because it is such a private experience. One aspect is the shame of not really being rich in a society that values wealth so highly. “You don’t picture that someone who is extremely successful is somebody who might be buried in debt. That might be the reality, and I think it’s because people are ashamed to talk about it… We associated success in our culture with being financially stable and prosperous. If you’re in the negative, you’re not really rich or wealth. And that’s the dream, to be rich and wealthy,” she says. Shame also originates from the feeling of being victimized. People don’t really understand how debt works, says Powell – that it is sold in a secondary market, or backed up by a promissory note. And taking on an 80,000 or 90,000 student loan when you’re 19, or racking up credit card bills in an effort to “build credit” create both opportunities and risks that are hard for many people to navigate. Because of the shameful and shared nature of debt, Powell's subjects found talking about it to be cathartic. She sees the interviews she conducted while taking her photographs as “the meat of the project,” an opportunity to share experiences and create an oral history of America's indebtedness. -Stunning photos show why S.

The Democrats, whose bill is unlikely to survive the GOP-controlled Senate, accuse the White House of avoiding transparency and say they haven't been able to get an answer on whether Trump plans to follow Obama's policy of releasing visitor logs a few months after they were created. Trump has spent five weekends at the resort he has nicknamed the \\"winter White House\\" since his inauguration, but he will be staying in Washington this weekend, reports the Sun Sentinel, which notes that Trump visits to south Florida can usually be predicted by the issuing of no-fly notices earlier in the week. Trump's decision to stay in DC will mean fewer security headaches for the organizers of this weekend's Palm Beach International Boat Show, though the Palm Beach County Republican Party was probably hoping for a Trump appearance at the Lincoln Day event it is holding at Mar-a-Lago. Expand this summary.","completion":"Senate Democrats have presented a bill, dubbed the MAR-A-LAGO Act—\\"Make Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act\\"—, which calls for President Trump to release visitor logs from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, as well as the White House and any other location where he conducts official business. The Democrats, who argue that the White House has avoided transparency, have been unable to discover whether Trump intends to adhere to Obama's policy of making visitor logs public a few months after they were created. Since his inauguration, Trump has spent five weekends at the Mar-a-Lago estate, which he calls the \\"winter White House.\\" The bill's introduction is primarily a response to concerns over the amount of time President Trump spends at the Mar-a-Lago resort and questions about who he is interacting with during his visits. President Trump's time at the estate raises concerns regarding public transparency and potential conflicts of interest. While the MAR-A-LAGO Act aims to improve transparency and trust in the current administration, it is unlikely to survive the GOP-controlled Senate. Despite the Democrats' accusations of avoiding transparency, the Trump administration still has the opportunity to follow Obama's policy of releasing visitor logs a few months after their creation voluntarily. The President's visits to the Mar-a-Lago estate also bring attention to the potential increased security risks and the financial burden on local law enforcement during his stays. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department has paid millions of dollars in overtime to help secure the area during Trump's visits, which would likely be decreased if the frequency of his trips to the estate were reduced. Furthermore, President Trump's decision to remain in Washington, D.C., this weekend avoids causing additional security challenges for the organizers of this weekend's Palm Beach International Boat Show. Although the Palm Beach County Republican Party has anticipated a Trump appearance at their Lincoln Day event held at Mar-a-Lago, a change in plans would alleviate some logistical and security concerns for the organizers. In summary, the Democrats' MAR-A-LAGO Act aims to uphold the principles of transparency and openness in the current administration, though its survival in the Republican-controlled Senate is highly unlikely. The bill focuses on tracking visitor logs for President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, the White House, and any other location where he conducts official business. The proposed legislation highlights concerns regarding public transparency, security risks, and financial burdens on local law enforcement during the President's visits to the Mar-a-Lago resort. Regardless of the bill's outcome, the Trump administration has the opportunity to voluntarily follow Obama's policy of releasing visitor logs a few months after they were created."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Post’s owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, repurposed it as a rallying cry in a 2016 interview about why he bought the paper: I think a lot of us believe this: that democracy dies in darkness, that certain institutions have a very important role in making sure that there is light. And I think the Washington Post has a seat, an important seat, to do that, because we happen to be located here in the capital city of the United States of America. Advertisement In Bezos’ mind, then, the motto is really about “making sure there is light.” Still, it’s hard to shake the sense that we’re reading dispatches from the end times with those three D-words looming atop the paper’s home page. The grim action verb, the present tense, the dunh-dunh-dunh alliteration, the foreboding final word: Cormac McCarthy, take notes! Far be it for us at Slate to chide fellow journalists for apocalyptic responses to our present political predicament. That said, we can imagine that the backlash and mockery might give the Post’s executives pause as they ponder putting the motto on their subscribers’ doorsteps every morning, and we’re here to help. Should Washington’s paper of record decide at some point that it wants to strike a slightly gentler tone, here are 15 classic metal album titles that might fit the bill.

Post spokesperson Kris Coratti told CNN that readers should expect to see more of it on other platforms of the publication. ADVERTISEMENT \\"We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year,\\" Coratti said last week. \\"We started with our newest readers on Snapchat, and plan to roll it out on our other platforms in the coming weeks.\\" Members of other media organizations were seen mocking the new slogan online on Tuesday and Wednesday: I thought people were joking about this new WP motto: \\"democracy dies in darkness.\\" They were not.

(A shorter version, \\"Liberty under law, true industrial freedom\\" appeared on our masthead as late as 1970.) ||||| The Washington Post revamped its journalistic brand Tuesday night with a new slogan, labeling its reporting as a friend of American democracy, not the enemy. The 140-year-old paper’s adopted slogan “Democracy Dies in Darkness” is now on the website’s homepage underneath the title. Popularized by legendary American investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Washington Post Communications Director Shani George said the alliteration-bent slogan has been internally used by the media organization for years. “We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year,” George told CBS News. George said the slogan was orginally revealed last Friday not in response to President Trump’s freewheeling Thursday afternoon press conference, but instead for the paper’s launching of Snapchat Discover, a Silicon Valley-style reinvention in line with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ vision of building a younger, more mobile readership. Bezos purchased The Washington Post for 250 million in 2013. Woodward, who joined CBS’ “Face the Nation” over the weekend, repeated the slogan in his response to a posed question regarding journalistic integrity and Mr. Trump’s brandish attacks and railings against the media in person and on Twitter. “The press is not that enemy. And the concern in the press is that we’ll have secret government. That government does things that we should know about that we don’t,” Woodward said. “And the judge who said it got it right, democracies die in darkness. And so we’re working against the darkness.” The judge that Woodward was referring to is US District Judge Algenon L. Marbley, who questioned an Ohio state attorney about voter suppression tactics during a 2012 court hearing. Shortly after the exchange, the judge’s comments about transparency went viral, especially on progressive news organizations’ websites such as The Atlantic and ThinkProgress. So far, the new slogan has not reached the actual front page copy of the paper. But that might change. George said the paper expects to integrate the slogan across different mediums in the upcoming weeks. In past 24 hours, Twitter users across the political spectrum have responded to the slogan in different ways, including some oddball parodies: Look beneath The Post's web masthead. \\"Democracy dies in darkness.\\" For years, that has been a guiding principle for @realBobWoodward. — Robert Costa (@costareports) February 22, 2017 \\"Democracy dies in darkness\\" @washingtonpost new slogan - basically says it all.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Pseudolabrus is a genus of wrasses native to the eastern Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean . - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.

Premise: \\"but nevertheless it's it's so much it's so hard to get back to it and it's it's so much easier while you've got your academic juices flowing\\" The premise discusses the idea of getting back into something, presumably referring to an academic pursuit or task. The statement implies that it is challenging to return to this endeavor, which is illustrated through the phrase \\"it's so hard to get back to it.\\" Furthermore, the statement also acknowledges that the task is considerably easier to complete or engage with when one has their \\"academic juices flowing.\\" This idea suggests that when individuals are already immersed in an academic environment or mindset, it becomes less daunting and manageable. Hypothesis: \\"It's really hard to get back into it.\\" The hypothesis simply restates the underlying assumption present in the premise - that returning to a specific academic pursuit is notably difficult. The use of the word \\"really\\" serves as an emphasis, further highlighting the challenge involved in getting back into the task. Thus, the hypothesis is an accurate reflection of the notion put forth in the premise. The premise entails that returning to an academic task is difficult, especially when compared to the ease experienced when one is already actively involved in their academic pursuits. This idea is concisely captured in the hypothesis, which suggests that it is “really hard to get back into it.” In conclusion, the hypothesis, \\"It's really hard to get back into it,\\" is entailed by the premise provided. The premise outlines the challenges faced when attempting to return to an academic task or environment. It contrasts this with the comparative ease experienced when already engaged in this context, leading to the notion that re-engaging with academic pursuits can be a struggle.

Answer the following question: What is the full name of the album that was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically? Answer the above question based on the context below: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

A: Answer:","completion":"The methanoate ion, also commonly called the formate ion, is an anion with the chemical formula CHOO¯ or HCOO¯. It is derived from either formic acid (HCOOH) or methanoic acid (CHOOH). These two terms, formic and methanoic, are used interchangeably; however, the name \\"formate\\" is derived from the Latin word for ant, \\"formica,\\" due to the natural presence of formic acid in ants. Formates are widely occurring in nature and can be produced through multiple processes, such as the oxidation of primary alcohols or the reduction of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, it can be found in some plants and animal venoms, including ants, wasps, and bees. The formate ion plays an essential role in various biochemical and industrial processes. In biology, it serves as an energy source for certain microorganisms through formate fermentation. In industry, formate salts, such as sodium formate and potassium formate, are used as buffering agents, de-icing agents, and as intermediates in the production of other chemicals. In summary, the methanoate ion is commonly called the formate ion. It is an anion derived from formic or methanoic acid and plays crucial roles in nature and industry alike. Formic acid's association with ants, stemming from its Latin etymology, led to the adoption of the name \\"formate.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. and a hint : A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. Please answer this question : If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower?

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What year was the school founded by the Bull brothers demolished? , can you please find it? Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers.

Almost all the dead were students. Another people 79 were injured. Four militant gunmen were killed, and officials say they are holding five people for questioning - one of whom is believed to be a university security guard. Buses are transporting more than 600 students and about 50 staff who survived the attacks to their home areas, Garissa governor Nathif Jama Adam told Reuters news agency. Mr Kenyatta vowed to \\"fight terrorism to the end\\" and said the militants would not succeed in their aim of creating an Islamic caliphate in Kenya. \\"I want you to know that our security forces are pursuing the remaining accomplices. We will bring all of them to justice,\\" he said. \\"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation, and we will do everything to defend our way of life.\\" He called on political and religious leaders to \\"speak in a united voice\\" and give \\"weightiest consideration\\" to national security. The task of combating terrorism had been complicated by the fact that \\"the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities\\", Mr Kenyatta added. \\"We will not allow them to continue their lives as normal,\\" he said. The president's address came as the relatives of victims queued at a morgue in the capital Nairobi to identify their loved ones. Emmanuel Igunza, BBC World Service, Nairobi At the Nairobi mortuary where bodies of the dead students were taken, a woman I met had travelled from eastern Kenya, frustrated by the lack of news about her son. She had last spoken to him just as gunmen stormed the university. His phone then went dead. \\"I can only hope that just maybe he is alive and hiding somewhere. But as a mother, I can feel and tell he won't come back to me alive,\\" she said. Anxious parents and relatives were privately being shown pictures of the victims. Some broke down after the fate of their loved ones became clear. A Red Cross official told me the process was slow, as they first had to reconstruct bodies because of severe and, in some cases, multiple gunshot wounds. Others had been beheaded. Who are the victims? Survivors 'were too scared to scream' Why is al-Shabab targeting Kenya? The bodies were flown to Nairobi for identification, as local mortuaries have been unable to cope, and many of the students killed came from other parts of the country. The bodies of the four gunmen who died remain in Garissa, where they were put on public display on Saturday. Earlier on Saturday, a 19-year-old girl was found unhurt in a cupboard on the university campus, where she had hid for two days. Security officials had to bring in a teacher to convince her that it was safe to come out. She told reporters that she drank body lotion when she felt hungry. While many of the survivors have spoken to the media, little is known so far about those who were killed. There has been criticism in Garissa, which is 150km (100 miles) from the Somali border, at how the security services dealt with the attack. Only two guards were on duty at the time of the assault, despite official warnings that an attack on an institution of higher learning was likely. Al-Shabab, which is based in neighbouring Somalia, has pledged a \\"long, gruesome war\\" against Kenya. The group said its attacks were in retaliation for acts by Kenya's security forces, who are part of the African Union's mission in Somalia against al-Shabab. Garissa university campus 1.

In response to this brutal act, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta declared the group to be an \\"existential threat\\" to the nation. He also announced that the government would focus on dismantling the networks of those involved in planning and financing terrorist activities in the country. In addition, President Kenyatta declared a three-day mourning period for the victims of the attack, during which time relatives of those who perished were left to identify their loved ones at a morgue in Nairobi. As the tragedy unfolded, it was reported that four militant gunmen were killed during the assault, with five additional people taken into custody for questioning. One of the detainees is believed to have been a university security guard. Over 600 students and about 50 staff members survived the attack. In the aftermath, they were transported back to their hometowns by bus. President Kenyatta vowed to \\"fight terrorism to the end\\" and emphasized that the militants would not succeed in establishing an Islamic caliphate in Kenya, pledging to bring all accomplices to justice and defending the nation's way of life. Calling for unity among political and religious leaders, he also acknowledged the challenges posed by the fact that \\"the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities.\\" Despite these difficulties, the President asserted that his government would not allow such individuals to continue their lives as normal. However, questions were raised surrounding the security response to the attack and whether the government failed to adequately protect the university. Only two guards were on duty at the time, even though there had been official warnings suggesting an attack on an institution of higher education was likely. Al-Shabab, based in neighboring Somalia, has carried out numerous attacks against Kenya, often in retaliation for the actions of Kenyan security forces as part of the African Union's mission in Somalia."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: About 9,000 stroke patients a year are missing out on a treatment that can prevent disability following a stroke, say UK experts. Article:","completion":"Title: 9,000 Stroke Patients a Year Miss Out on Crucial Treatment to Prevent Disability in the UK Introduction Nearly 9,000 stroke patients in the United Kingdom miss out on a vital treatment that can potentially prevent disability, according to stroke experts. Despite the significant advancements in modern medicine and healthcare, numerous individuals are not receiving the appropriate care, leaving them with a higher risk of living with incapacitating consequences post-stroke. This public health issue requires urgent attention and solutions to ensure that every stroke patient receives optimal healthcare and the chance to attain a better quality of life. Background on strokes A stroke occurs when blood supply to a certain part of the brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of necessary oxygen and nutrients. This event can result in brain cells' death within minutes, leading to long-term damage or even fatality. There are two types of strokes: ischemic (caused by blocked arteries) and hemorrhagic (caused by ruptured blood vessels). Both lead to severe consequences, with potential impacts on a patient's mobility, speech, memory, and cognitive abilities, among others. Importance of early treatment Stroke experts emphasize the critical importance of early intervention in minimizing potential disabilities. Timely treatment can help salvage brain tissue, restore blood flow, and stimulate healing. Early diagnosis is particularly relevant for thrombolysis, a procedure where clot-dissolving medication is administered, potentially reversing some of the damage. This treatment is most effective when administered within four and a half hours of a stroke and could reduce the risk of disability by almost 30 percent. Reasons behind the missed treatments There are different reasons why a significant number of stroke patients miss out on essential treatments. One major factor is the unawareness or misinterpretation of stroke symptoms. Many individuals may not recognize the signs of a stroke occurring and might delay in seeking medical help, which often leads to a missed window of opportunity for effective treatment. Another contributing factor could be the lack of available resources and infrastructure in certain areas, leading to delayed diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Addressing the issue To ensure that stroke patients receive the appropriate and timely care, various measures must be taken. It is crucial to raise public awareness about the recognition, risk factors, and signs of a stroke. Educational campaigns and public health initiatives can play a vital role in promoting preventative measures, helping people identify stroke symptoms, and encouraging them to seek immediate help. Additionally, improving access to healthcare services and resources can alleviate this problem. This could involve increasing the availability of stroke specialists, facilitating transportation to stroke centers, and implementing telemedicine technology to reach patients in remote areas. Healthcare providers are also encouraged to adhere to best practices and guidelines for stroke treatment, ensuring that patients are given the best chance of recovery. By promoting collaboration, communication, and coordination between multidisciplinary teams, medical professionals can deliver quality care and ensure a more streamlined patient experience. Conclusion Addressing the missed opportunities for stroke treatment is an urgent and essential task for public health authorities and the medical community. By increasing awareness, optimizing access to healthcare resources, and providing the best possible care to patients, the lives of thousands of UK stroke patients can be significantly improved every year. In doing so, not only will the quality of life for stroke survivors be enhanced, but the burden on families, caretakers, and society as a whole can be reduced, ultimately benefiting the UK's overall public health landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens where its predecessor left off. Mike flees from Boulton mortuary in the hearse, while Reggie is trapped inside by The Tall Man's spheres. Rather than kill Reggie, The Tall Man lets him go, saying he is doing so \\"to play one last game\\", then The Tall Man leaves Boulton. Mike's brother Jody, now a steel sphere that can occasionally resume its human form, persuades a reluctant Reggie to go looking for Mike. On the way, Reggie is attacked by a mysterious psychopathic demon disguised as a police officer. Reggie escapes only after shooting, stabbing, and immolating the demon. Later, Reggie rescues a woman named Jennifer from her overturned car and takes her to the next town. They stay the night at an abandoned motel where Reggie tells her the story of The Tall Man. A disbelieving Jennifer rejects his advances before Reggie falls asleep and dreams of Mike. Disturbed, Reggie seeks solace from Jennifer and discovers she has two spheres where her breasts should be. The spheres attack Reggie, who manages to destroy one with a sledgehammer but is pinned to the wall by the other. In desperation he strikes his tuning fork and the sphere explodes. Reggie then dispatches the demon Jennifer with the sledgehammer before leaving. Mike, trying to uncover the mysteries of The Tall Man in order to escape his transformation, drives through abandoned towns and remembers the last days of his youth before The Tall Man's arrival. The Tall Man appears in the back of the car, assumes control of the automobile, and disappears into a coffin. Mike drives the hearse into Death Valley, where he writes a last testament, in which he expresses his intent to force The Tall Man into a \\"final\\" confrontation.

Answer the following question: Question: Where is a very bad place to find a crab? Options: - chesapeake bay - underpants - seychelles - fishing boat - cooking pot Explain why a human would choose \\"underpants\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would likely choose \\"underpants\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where is a very bad place to find a crab?\\" because it would be an incredibly unexpected and uncomfortable situation. Considering the given options, let me explain why \\"underpants\\" would be seen as the worst option and provide reasoning for the other options as well. 1. Chesapeake Bay: Chesapeake Bay is a well-known location for finding crabs, particularly the famous blue crab. The bay serves as a suitable habitat for many crab species and is an appropriate environment for crabs to thrive. As a result, finding crabs in the Chesapeake Bay would be considered normal, and perhaps even desirable, especially for those in search of fresh seafood. 2. Underpants: This option would be the most unfavorable place to find a crab since it signifies an intimate and personal area for a human. Discovering a crab in one's underpants would likely result in a great deal of discomfort, distress, and potential injury. The unexpected presence of a crab in such a location could cause physical harm by pinching the sensitive skin in that area or triggering a panic response from the human. There might also be feelings of embarrassment, invasion of privacy, and uncleanliness associated with finding a crab in this location. 3. Seychelles: The Seychelles is an island nation known for its beautiful beaches and tropical climate. It is a natural habitat for various marine life, including crabs, which are often found along the shores and in the coastal waters. Finding a crab in the Seychelles would not be surprising or undesirable, making it an unsuitable answer for the question. 4. Fishing Boat: If one finds a crab on a fishing boat, it usually means that the crab has been caught by the fishers for consumption or sale. This scenario is not an unusual occurrence since fishing is a common profession, and crabs represent a popular seafood choice for many people. Finding a crab on a fishing boat would be considered ordinary and not necessarily bad. 5. Cooking Pot: Finding a crab in a cooking pot implies that it is being prepared as a meal. Consuming crab is common in many cuisines worldwide, and cooking it in a pot is a typical method of preparation. While the crab might not be enjoying its fate, for humans, this situation wouldn't be considered a bad place to find a crab. In conclusion, out of the given options, a human would choose \\"underpants\\" as the worst place to find a crab due to the unexpectedness, discomfort, injury potential, and psychological implications associated with encountering a crab in such a personal and sensitive area. The other options are either natural habitats for the crab, appropriate places for catching the crab, or common places to cook and prepare a crab. Thus, \\"underpants\\" stands out as the most undesirable choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In the early 20th century, the writings of Albert Richardson were responsible for a re-awakening of interest in pure neoclassical design. Vincent Harris (compare Harris's colonnaded and domed interior of Manchester Central Reference Library to the colonnaded and domed interior by John Carr and R R Duke), Bradshaw Gass & Hope and Percy Thomas were among those who designed public buildings in the neoclassical style in the interwar period. In the British Raj in India, Sir Edwin Lutyens' monumental city planning for New Delhi marked the sunset of neoclassicism. In Scotland and the north of England, where the Gothic Revival was less strong, architects continued to develop the neoclassical style of William Henry Playfair. The works of Cuthbert Brodrick and Alexander Thomson show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric. What new design was trending after neoclassical?","completion":"After the neoclassical design, the Modernist movement became the dominant architectural trend. This new design movement emerged in the early 20th century as a response to various technological, societal, and cultural changes. Modernism rejected the ornate and historical references of neoclassical and other traditional styles, instead emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and rationality in design. Notable architects of the Modernist movement include Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright, among others. These architects and their contemporaries developed innovative designs that incorporated new materials, such as concrete, glass, and steel, while prioritizing open spaces, clean lines, and minimal ornamentation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Short movie review: little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic seems to have a mixed-to-negative perception of the movie \\"Monsoon Wedding.\\" The review points out some aspects of the film that the critic did not find compelling or satisfying. By describing the movie as \\"little too ponderous\\" and \\"not remotely incisive enough,\\" it is evident that the critic had certain expectations about the film that were not met. The critic likely wanted the movie to serve as either entertainment or thought-provoking drama but feels that it failed on both counts. They describe the film as not working as \\"shallow entertainment,\\" indicating that they found the narrative or pacing too slow or contemplative for audiences just looking for an engaging watch. The term \\"ponderous\\" suggests that the film may have delved too deeply into certain themes or subplots, which, in the critic's view, detracted from its overall appeal as a form of entertainment. On the other hand, the critic also believes that \\"Monsoon Wedding\\" did not possess enough depth or insight to qualify as a drama. This statement implies that while the film may have tried to explore complex themes or ideas, it fell short in terms of delivering a meaningful message or captivating performances. The phrase \\"not remotely incisive enough\\" further emphasizes the critic's disappointment in the film's inability to genuinely impact the audience as a drama should. In summary, the critic appears to have a mixed-to-negative view of \\"Monsoon Wedding.\\" They feel that the movie was unsuccessful in providing an entertaining experience for casual viewers and lacked the necessary depth and nuance for a truly engaging drama. Though the review doesn't provide a comprehensive assessment of the film, the critic's opinion is decidedly more negative than positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator of single gender education says, \\" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\\" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \\" Boys interpret the world as objects moving through space,\\" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class. The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently. \\" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \\" says Chadwell. \\" They think you're mad and can shut down. \\" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \\" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\\" 1. What are the names of the two teachers? 2.

The two teachers named in the text are Carneau and Lynne. 2. They both teach second grade at a primary school in east South Carolina. 3. Carneau and Lynne believe that isolating boys and girls in separate classrooms leads to immediate academic improvement for both genders. 4. The colors that generally attract the attention of boys are cooler ones, particularly colors such as silver and black. 5. Boys are more inclined to draw pictures reflecting motion and direction, for instance, moving objects. 6. Females, contrastingly, are more inclined to create drawings that depict a joyful and colorful family setting. 7. No, boys and girls do not view the world the same way according to David Chadwell's explanation. Due to the differing composition of male and female eyes, they perceive their surroundings differently. For instance, boys interpret their environment as objects moving in space. 8. Female eyes are generally attracted to warmer colors, including red, yellow, and orange. 9. Besides red, another color that garners the attention of girls is orange. 10. No, the instructor does not need to move as much when teaching girls compared to boys. Girls are more responsive to descriptive phrases and various colors used in presentations or on the blackboard, according to Chadwell. 11. Boys and girls also experience auditory signals in different ways. Chadwell suggests that girls perceive loud sounds as yelling, whilst for boys, a more forceful or excited tone is effective. 12. When someone speaks in a loud tone, girls interpret it as yelling and may believe the speaker is angry. This can potentially cause them to shut down or disengage. 13.

The stock ticker information is provided (JP: 8306: news, chart, profile). The sentence indicates that the company's stock declined in value by 3,000 yen, which is equivalent to a 0.65 percent dip. The stock's new value after the decline is 456,000 yen. 2. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (JP: 8316: news, chart, profile) was down 2.5 percent at 198,000 yen.

Choices: - stress - success - failure - bankruptcy - cash The rationale to choose \\"success\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Opening a business comes with a range of experiences and emotions; it is a journey filled with various outcomes such as stress, success, failure, bankruptcy, and cash flow. However, among these choices, the most viable and ideal option to look forward to when starting a business is \\"success.\\" The rationale for choosing this answer is multi-faceted, which can be elaborated further as follows: 1. Personal Fulfillment: Success in business is not just about the financial gains; it also includes the personal satisfaction that one derives from achieving their goals and realizing their dreams. When you launch a business, you invest significant time, effort, and resources in transforming your ideas into reality. Seeing your business flourish and become profitable, due to your hard work and dedication, can lead to immense personal fulfillment. 2. Financial Gain and Stability: Undoubtedly, one of the primary objectives in establishing a business is securing financial stability. A successful business generates revenue and profit, which, in turn, enables you to improve your financial standing, support your family, and invest in future endeavors. When your business flourishes, the monetary rewards you attain are an essential reason to look forward to success. 3. Creating Employment Opportunities: Starting a successful business also has a direct impact on the economy and the local community. When your venture thrives, you can create job opportunities, thus providing others with a chance for stable income and growth. It contributes to social development and helps alleviate unemployment levels, which is another compelling reason to aim for success in your business. 4. Enhancing Your Brand Image: As your business achieves success, it also helps in establishing and strengthening brand recognition and image. With a robust and reliable brand name, your target audience, customers, and potential investors become more trusting and inclined to engage with your products or services. As a result, business success paves the way for long-term growth and development. 5. Expansion and Continual Growth: A successful business has the potential to expand its market reach, diversify its product or service offerings, and explore new customer segments. With increased growth comes enhanced opportunities to expand your business both locally and internationally. Such developments can provide continued motivation and excitement, making the path of success even more appealing. 6. Personal and Professional Development: Lastly, the pursuit of success in your business leads to personal and professional growth. As an entrepreneur, you will need to continuously adapt, learn new skills, and navigate through the challenges of running a business. This journey allows you to enhance your capabilities and grow into a more resilient and skilled individual. In conclusion, when one opens a business, the overarching goal should be to achieve success, as it encompasses both personal and professional fulfillment, financial gain, social contributions, brand development, and opportunities for expansion. Although challenges like stress, failure, and bankruptcy may emerge along the way, they should be considered as stepping stones or learning experiences rather than the primary focus of your entrepreneurial journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"\\"Less effect\\". Justifying this answer: The second effect mentioned is \\"Makes water acidic.\\" If we assume open fields far from cities, pollutants responsible for acid rain (generally produced from urban and industrial activities) would be less likely to be present.

En 2005-2006, l’APECA a continué à impliquer les partenaires économiques pour donner suite aux priorités économiques stratégiques de la région de l’Atlantique. Which language is this?","completion":"The language of the given text is French. The text is discussing the actions of APECA (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency or Agence de promotion économique du Canada atlantique in French) during the period of 2005-2006. It mentions that APECA continued to involve economic partners to follow up on the strategic economic priorities of the Atlantic region. French is a widely spoken language around the globe, including in Canada, Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia and South America. It's one of Canada's two official languages, the other one being English. In Canada, French is primarily spoken in the province of Quebec, but there are French-speaking communities scattered across other provinces as well. Furthermore, this text uses several hallmark features of the French language. For instance, the use of “à” which is a preposition often used to indicate direction, location, time, manner, purpose or situation, and the use of the accent mark in the word “économiques” which indicates pronunciation is also a typical French language feature. The ordinal number “de”, which is equivalent to 'of' or 'from' in English, is used to denotes origin, possession, purpose. The French language, like most Romance languages, also has the concept of gendered nouns, and this can be observed in the text with the use of the word “la”, which is the feminine singular definite article. The French language can be complex due to its grammatical structures and use of accent marks, but it is known for its beauty and influenced a substantial portion of the English vocabulary. Through its language, one can get a glimpse of the rich culture, history, and traditions of French-speaking populations worldwide."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Who wrote the novel 'The Moonstone'?","completion":"The Moonstone, a detective novel and one of the first examples of the mystery genre, was written by the British author Wilkie Collins. Born on January 8, 1824, in London, England, William Wilkie Collins was a prominent Victorian novelist, playwright, and short story writer. Collins is often credited with pioneering the genre of sensational fiction, along with detective and mystery fiction. He was a close friend of Charles Dickens, another iconic figure in British literature, who not only influenced Collins' work but also published some of his stories in Dickens' periodicals like \\"Household Words\\" and \\"All the Year Round.\\" The Moonstone, published in 1868, has been widely regarded as the first and preeminent detective novel in the English language. The novel revolves around a precious diamond called the \\"Moonstone,\\" stolen from an Indian temple, that becomes the center of an intricate plot filled with suspense, subterfuge, and an ensemble of fascinating characters. The Moonstone also introduced major characteristics now synonymous with detective fiction, such as the figure of Sergeant Cuff, the gentlemanly detective; the multiple narrators who provide different perspectives on the story; and the innovative use of red herrings to mislead both the characters and the reader. Furthermore, Collins delved into social issues of his time, including British colonialism and the oppression of women, thus adding depth to his narrative. Throughout his career, Wilkie Collins penned numerous novels, including \\"The Woman in White\\" (1859), one of his most well-known works. However, The Moonstone remains a cornerstone of detective literature, setting the standard for future authors and works in the genre. Collins' influence can be seen in works by authors such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes, and Agatha Christie, known as the \\"Queen of Crime.\\" Consequently, Wilkie Collins' legacy lives on through his groundbreaking novel and the lasting impact it has had on literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: she is playing wonderwall .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine whether or not we can conclude the hypothesis that the woman is playing \\"Wonderwall,\\" we will need to analyze the given information and assess other possible factors that may influence this determination. The premise provides limited information, which is merely a description of the scene: \\"a man in a black shirt sits next to a woman playing the guitar.\\" From this information alone, we cannot confidently confirm or deny that the woman is playing \\"Wonderwall.\\" To expand on this analysis, it is important to highlight that the premise does not provide any data regarding the following aspects of the situation: 1. The context: There is no information about where the scene takes place, such as whether it's in a park, a room, or a concert hall. The context could provide clues as to what is being played or performed. 2. The type of event: No details are given about the event, such as whether it's a formal performance, an informal gathering, or a spontaneous moment. This could affect the choice of song the woman is playing. 3. The music itself: Since there is no mention of the tune, melody, chords, or lyrics being played or sung, it is impossible to determine if the song is indeed \\"Wonderwall\\" based on the premise alone. 4. Possible relationship between the man and woman: There is no information provided about how the man and woman may know each other or if they are strangers. This might give an indication of the musical choices being made in that given scenario. Looking beyond the limitations of the premise itself, we can explore other sources of evidence that may help support or contradict the hypothesis: 1. If additional information was provided about the music, such as the song's chords or lyrics being sung, this could offer a more definitive answer. For example, if the lyrics mentioned \\"You're my wonderwall,\\" we could conclude that the hypothesis is likely true. If the lyrics were from an entirely different song, we could reasonably reject the hypothesis. 2. If the man or the woman were somehow identifiable as, say, famous musicians known for performing \\"Wonderwall,\\" it would give credibility to the hypothesis. In contrast, if they were identified as musicians with no affiliation to \\"Wonderwall\\" or its creators, it would be less probable for the hypothesis to hold. 3. The time period and cultural context, which are not mentioned in the premise, could play an essential role. If the scene takes place during the mid-90s when \\"Wonderwall\\" by Oasis was released and was highly popular, it might increase the likelihood of the hypothesis. Alternatively, if the scene takes place in a different time period or cultural context where \\"Wonderwall\\" is not widely known, the probability of the hypothesis being true would decrease. In conclusion, based on the information given in the premise alone, we cannot conclude that the woman is playing \\"Wonderwall.\\" There is simply not enough evidence to support or refute the claim. However, considering additional factors like the song's lyrics, the musicians' identities, or cultural and time period context could provide more insight into the truth of the hypothesis. Without those insights, it remains indeterminate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor. Scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. Calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in Dubai. Scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.

The context discusses the song \\"I'm So Sorry\\" by Imagine Dragons and its connection to lead-singer Dan Reynolds' depression struggles. It also mentions two other songs, \\"Hopeless Opus\\" and \\"Gold\\" that touch upon these struggles. Depression is a complex and multifaceted mental health condition. It is an ongoing battle for many individuals and can manifest differently from person to person. While creating music and art can aid in expressing and processing emotions, there is no guarantee that it will lead to a complete resolution of an individual's depression. Moreover, the context does not provide any information regarding any specific treatments, interventions, or support systems that Reynolds may be utilizing to address his depression. Recovery from depression is possible for many individuals with the appropriate professional support, including therapy and medication when necessary, as well as personal lifestyle changes and a strong support network. It is important to note that while public figures like Reynolds may share some aspects of their journey with mental health, their personal experiences and recovery process may not be completely disclosed. In conclusion, the context does not provide a sufficient basis to draw the hypothesis that Dan Reynolds will be cured of his depression. It only indicates that Reynolds has dealt with depression and has incorporated this personal experience into his music. It is important to approach the subject of mental health recovery cautiously, acknowledging that each individual's journey is unique and cannot be presumed based on limited information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \\"Apostle to the English\\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams. - Justin Portal Welby (born 6 January 1956) is the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury and the most senior bishop in the Church of England. Welby was the vicar of Southam, Warwickshire, and most recently was the Bishop of Durham, serving for just over a year. As Archbishop of Canterbury he is the Primate of All England and the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion. - The Gnostic Gospels are a collection of about 54 ancient texts based upon the teachings of several spiritual leaders, which were written from the 2nd to the 4th century AD. The sayings of the Gospel of Thomas, compiled circa 140, may include some traditions even older than some of the gospels of the New Testament, possibly as early as the second half of the first century. These gospels are not part of the standard Biblical canon of any mainstream Christian denomination, and as such are part of what is called the New Testament apocrypha. Recent novels, films, and video games that refer to the gospels have increased public interest. - The Gregorian mission or Augustinian mission was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to convert Britain's Anglo-Saxons. Headed by Augustine of Canterbury, by the death of the last missionary in 635 the mission had established Christianity in southern Britain. Along with the Irish and Frankish missions it converted other parts of Britain as well and influenced the Hiberno-Scottish missions to Continental Europe. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - Ini Kopuria ( died 1945 ) , a police officer from Maravovo , Guadalcanal , Solomon Islands formed the Melanesian Brotherhood in 1925 . He and the Bishop of Melanesia , the Right Reverend John Manwaring Steward , realised Ini 's dream by forming a band of brothers ( known in the Mota language as ' Ira Reta Tasiu ' ) to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the non-Christian areas of Melanesia . He is commemorated in the calendars of saints of the Church of the Province of Melanesia , of the Church of England , and of the Episcopal Church ( USA ) . - The Northern Solomons were the more northerly group of islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago over which Germany declared a protectorate in 1885. Initially the German Solomon Islands Protectorate included Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java Islands, but in 1900 these islands were transferred to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The largest of the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, continued under German administration until World War I when it fell to Australia, and after the war, it formally passed to Australian jurisdiction under a League of Nations mandate. Today, the original North Solomon Islands are split between the Autonomous Region of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea and the successor state of the British Solomon Islands which was officially renamed from \\"the British Solomon Islands Protectorate\\" to \\"Solomon Islands\\" in 1975 prior to becoming an independent, sovereign state in 1976. - The English Reformation was a series of events in 16th century England by which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. These events were, in part, associated with the wider process of the European Protestant Reformation, a religious and political movement that affected the practice of Christianity across all of Europe during this period.

Options: - breathe - sky - build a nest - pick berries - reproduce The answer is \\"pick berries\\" because A:","completion":"August is a time when many berries are ripe and abundant. Step 1: Analyze the options given. Option 1: Breathe - Birds, like all animals, need to breathe, but it is not a specific activity for any particular time of the year or month. Option 2: Sky - This option does not refer to any specific activity of the birds and is not relevant to the time of the year. Option 3: Build a nest - Birds typically build nests during the breeding season which, for most species, occurs in spring (earlier than August). Option 4: Pick berries - August is generally a time when many types of berries ripen, providing a food source for some bird species. Option 5: Reproduce - Some birds might reproduce in August, depending on the species, but it is not a universally common time for it. Also, reproduction is closely linked to nest-building, which has already been addressed. Step 2: Choose the most logical answer. Considering the factors above, we can rule out options 1, 2, 3, and 5. Option 4, \\"pick berries,\\" is the most logical answer as it provides a specific activity that birds would do during the month of August which is related to abundant food sources available during that time. Therefore, the answer is \\"pick berries\\" because August is a time when many berries are ripe and abundant, providing an essential food source for birds during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted.

(Associated Press) Among them are two people whose two-story row house in a downtown residential neighborhood blew up about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday, police Chief Roger MacClean said. The cause of the explosion was unclear. The fires consumed an entire row of homes, fire Chief Robert Scheirer said. The blaze was put out early Thursday, delayed by the difficulty of digging through packed layers of snow and ice to a ruptured underground gas line that was feeding the flames, Scheirer said. He predicted eight houses would be lost and another 16 damaged. In all, 500 to 600 people were evacuated, including elderly residents of a high rise. Residents were allowed to return home early Thursday. They had been taken to a Jewish community center and an agricultural hall at the city's fairgrounds while emergency crews worked overnight. The blast was so powerful that it sent a flat-screen computer monitor sailing into the back of Antonio Arroyo, whose house was on the opposite end of the row from the house that exploded. \\"I thought we were under attack,\\" he recalled from a shelter where some 250 people took refuge in the hours after the blast. Arroyo and his wife, Jill, both 43, lost their home in the fire. Antonio said he ran outside and saw that an entire house had been leveled, a fireball now raging in the spot where it once stood. \\"What I saw, I couldn't believe,\\" said Arroyo, a community volunteer. He and his wife, a nurse, fled their home with only the clothes on their back. They planned to return at daylight to see what they could salvage. Jill Arroyo broke down sobbing when she recalled her son's athletic memorabilia _ likely lost in the blaze _ including DVDs of his high school football games. \\"The DVDs are gone. All his trophies are gone. All gone,\\" she sobbed as her husband comforted her. Tricia Aleski, who lives a few blocks away, said the explosion jangled her nerves. \\"I was reading a book in the living room and it felt like a giant kicked the house. It all shook. Everything shook,\\" she said. \\"I checked the stove and everything, (to) make sure everything's off.\\" Jason Soke was watching college basketball when he heard and felt the explosion.

Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim declined to identify the first four bodies recovered, describing them only as a 79-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman, a 16-year-old girl and a 4-month-old baby.The fifth body was found between 5 and 5:30 p.m. Thursday. It is believed to be that of Beatrice Hall, 74, of 544 N. 13th St., who was with her husband, William, 79, at 10:45 p.m. Wednesday when their house exploded and burned, city Fire Marshal Matthew Bainbridge said.\\"Everybody's been accounted for that we were aware of,\\" Bainbridge said Thursday night. \\"Cadaver dogs found the remains.

All residents of Gross Towers have returned to their homes.At a news conference Thursday morning, Allentown fire Chief Robert Scheirer said no reports of gas odors preceded the explosion. UGI officials said they are still investigating, but said a crew earlier in the week detected no leaks in the area during a routine inspection.“I think we are going under the assumption that it is a gas explosion, but it has not been confirmed to be the case,” Joseph Swope, a company spokesman said earlier.Swope said the 12-inch low pressure main involved in the incident had no leak history.The utility used foam to seal the gas main on both ends of a one-block area at about 3:45 a.m. Thursday. Swope said it took crews some time to cut through reinforced concrete underneath the pavement.Stunned neighbors groped for words to describe the explosion, which could be heard for miles.Antonio Arroyo, who lost his house at 530 N. 13th St. to the ensuing fire, said he was sure a bomb had gone off.“I thought it was bringing the war to our doorsteps,” said Arroyo, who was checking his e-mail when the force of the explosion blasted his computer into him and knocked him to the floor. All the windows in his home blew out and his front door was pushed in.Arroyo sobbed Thursday morning and hugged his wife, Jill, as he described watching for hours as the flames consumed his house.

They probably also value relaxation and comfort since they have chosen to stay in and play games in their big house, hinting at a possible preference for home comforts. But let's break it down step by step: 1. Firstly, Skylar had a fun day playing games. Here, using the adjective 'fun', we understand that Skylar enjoys playing games and had a pleasant time doing so. This tells us that Skylar might be playful and possibly has a fondness for gaming, whether board games, video games, or other types. 2. Secondly, Skylar was playing games in her big house. This can suggest that Skylar values comfort and familiarity because she opts to spend her time in her house. Doing activities at home might indicate she prefers a comfortable and familiar environment over going out.

Do these questions have the same meaning? I'm 25 and I want to buy bicycle around 6 or 7k. Can anyone suggest me? What do you wish you were a fly on the wall to?","completion":"No, these two questions have different meanings and purposes. 1. The first question is a request for suggestions on purchasing a bicycle: \\"I'm 25 and I want to buy a bicycle around 6 or 7k. Can anyone suggest me?\\" This question demonstrates that the individual asking is 25 years old and seeking advice on purchasing a bicycle with a budget of around 6,000 to 7,000 units (the specific currency is not mentioned, it could be dollars, euros, etc.). By requesting suggestions, the person is likely looking for recommendations on which bicycle models to consider, the features they should prioritize, or even the best place to purchase a bicycle within their given budget. A detailed response to this question would provide potential options, such as different bicycle types (e.g., road, mountain, or hybrid bicycles), key features to consider in a bicycle (e.g., frame material, gears, wheel size), and reputable or trusted retailers where the desired bicycle could be bought. 2. The second question explores a hypothetical scenario involving overhearing a conversation or witnessing an event: \\"What do you wish you were a fly on the wall to?\\" The expression \\"a fly on the wall\\" refers to the idea of being able to observe a situation or listen in on a conversation without being noticed, often in the context of gaining access to private or exclusive information. In this question, the person is asking for an event or conversation one would have liked to witness firsthand, if it were possible to do so without being observed. A detailed response to this question would depend upon the individual's interests, personal preferences, and experiences. For example, someone interested in history might have wanted to be a fly on the wall during pivotal meetings and discussions in the past (e.g., during the drafting of the United States Constitution). In contrast, someone who is a fan of a specific celebrity might wish to have overheard conversations between their favorite stars or witnessed backstage moments at a concert or event. In summary, these two questions are unrelated in terms of meaning and context. The first question involves seeking suggestions for buying a bicycle, while the second question asks about a hypothetical scenario that explores personal interests and curiosities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: My husband went from being able to walk/drive/work/make money/talk/throw our son in the air to being diagnosed with MS, having a mass in the brain stem, he is now walking with a walker, not being able to drive/work/make money, he now slurs his speech ... Matt went from the sole bread winner and provider to not in a matter of 2 weeks. My husband Matt and I have a son named London and we run the blog - Although we have not updated it in a long time. I would stay home with London full-time and Matt would work full-time and run his own side business, . Matt is an amazingly selfless person; such a loving husband and father and never complained about working so hard to get us by. Seriously, he would get up early at 5am, work on his side projects, take a shower and then go to work for a full 8 hours, then come home, play with London, spend time with me and then go back to his side business projects. Having a single income family is always a roll of the dice as you are relying on one person to bring in the resources and crossing your fingers nothing happens to that person. Well, something in fact did happen to that one person, my husband Matt. After a series of events, I rushed Matt to the emergency room when he woke up off balance, walking \\"sepentine\\" and banging into walls, slurring his speech, having numbness in the head/body and the inability to stand without falling over. When Matt mentioned \\"right arm,\\" that is when I completely lost it. Matt had \\"word salad\\" when I asked him a question. I was running around getting our son London's diaper changed, getting him dressed and getting myself dressed to get Matt to the ER and Matt actually hobbled over to his computer desk. Matt was concerned about finishing an email project at his computer, swirling in his chair as if he was hoola-hooping in a sitting position he was so off balance. I told him we were going to the ER and he fought me saying he had to finish his project. That is the kind of person Matt is; he cares so deeply for his family and his clients he wasn't concerned about his own discomfort, he wanted to finish his work. I know my husband so I called the ER and registered Matt saying he was exhibiting stroke symptoms. I told Matt, \\"You have an appointment at the ER, I called them and they are expecting you!\\" He was so so mad at me that I called the ER, but it got him to go to the hospital. When we got there, they rushed Matt right in. Matt's laying in a hospital bed talking about the email project he was working on, complaining we don't have insurance, we don't have the money for hospital bills, he has a shopping cart website to work on, etc. etc. etc. The nurses are attaching things to him, putting in an IV, doing his vitals and he would not be quiet about his clients and the work and this and that. After taking Matt's vitals, the nurses ordered an emergency MRI. I had London with me and he was SO GOOD! The nurses were saying that they couldn't believe London was severely autistic - he was so well behaved. London kept putting cotton balls and bandages on Matt's head, I think he was trying to fix him. It was sad and sweet. The results of the MRI were that Matt had a mass in his brain stem and they were transferring us from Hood River Providence to Portland Providence. LONG STORY SHORT: Matt's spinal fluid came back positive for Multiple Sclerosis. The neurologist does not believe that the mass in Matt's brain stem has anything to do with MS. We are on a 2 week break from Prednisone (steroid) to see what Matt's mass does in the brain stem. The brain stem is the size of your thumb, Matt's mass is a little over an inch. I am taking care of our son London and now Matt full-time. Luckily, we are receiving unemployment from when Matt was laid off. I am applying for any and all assistance available. The real blow for us was that we were denied charity services from Providence Hospital because they know our situation is so dire, we will receive state assistance. SSI can take months to go through and I am scared. Our friends and family are stepping in (we love them!) and taking London for us or dropping off groceries, filling our freezer with meals. So many people are helping us and I appreciate everyone. I NEED YOUR HELP: My amazing brother-in-law, Andy McCabe has set up a charity for us on youcaring .com and we have a wish list set up on Amazon. ?

(AP) — A boy's body was found late Monday night after a woman earlier reported throwing her 6-year-old son off the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon, said Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda. The chief of this coastal community said he was headed to the scene. Miranda said he had been told that the body was believed to be that of the boy. Detectives earlier were questioning the woman who made the 911 call Monday evening. Miranda had no immediate update on her status. The Coast Guard and Lincoln County authorities searched for hours after the call came in about 6:25 p.m. Monday, Miranda said. Officers found a woman at the scene. Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Jonathan Klingenberg said he understood the body was found floating near a marina. The Coast Guard dispatched two boats and a helicopter to search the water. The county sheriff's marine patrol and county search and rescue teams were also involved. In May 2009, a woman tossed her two young children off a bridge in Portland, killing her 4-year-old son. A daughter, then 7 years old, survived. Amanda Stott-Smith was sentenced in 2010 to at least 35 years in prison. The Yaquina Bay arched bridge, one of the most famous on the Oregon coast, opened in 1936. It's listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ||||| An Oregon mother who had a breakdown while caring for her autistic son and ailing husband allegedly threw the 6-year-old off a bridge and then called police to tell them, authorities and relatives said Tuesday. Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was arrested for the killing of her son London, police said. Authorities discovered the boy's body in the waters of Oregon's Yaquina Bay hours after McCabe called 911 late Monday. On Tuesday afternoon, McCabe made a brief appearance in Lincoln County court — via video conference while wearing restrictive clothing to designed to keep her from hurting herself. A judge ordered her held on 1 million bail on charges of aggravated murder, murder and 1st and 2nd degree manslaughter. She did not enter a plea and the judge set a preliminary hearing in the case for Nov. 12. In the past, McCabe had spoken and written of \\"pulling a Thelma and Louise\\" — a reference to the movie in which two women drive their car off a cliff — as a response to the stresses of her life. \\"We're all devastated,\\" Andrew McCabe, London's uncle, told NBC News. \\"London was a good kid. He loved hats. And his Dad.\\" “She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. Jillian McCabe at hearing in Lincoln County Court, Oregon, on Nov. 4. She appeared via video conference. KGW Relatives said the once-stable mother suffered a mental collapse in the face of incredible challenges: caring for a non-verbal and autistic child, a health crisis that left her husband fighting for his life, and the death of her father. \\"Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened,\\" said Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, who led the family effort to obtain psychiatric services for her. She was discharged more than once from inpatient care, she said. \\"It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get,\\" she said. \\"We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.\\" She declined to provide further details, citing privacy concerns. Oregon's state health agency said it could not comment on an individual patient's case. Family members say Jillian sought treatment when she lived in Hood River about two years ago. “We sought care on several occasions. Due to the limited options in the public health system, we were only able to get her into an outpatient facility in The Dalles,” brother-in-law Andy McCabe told NBC News Tuesday night. “It was a limited time allowed. And since they refused to admit her officially to an inpatient facility, she was released to us.\\" “ I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.” Tanya McCabe said London's mother had expressed thoughts of harming herself but the family never imagined she would kill her son. \\"Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition. When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was. \\"So this was shocking and heartbreaking.\\" The family's difficulties were chronicled extensively on social media, through YouTube, Facebook and Google Plus.

On a fundraising website set up by family and friends, Jillian McCabe wrote that her husband Matt had been diagnosed with MS and had a mass in his brain stem — going from acting as \\"the sole breadwinner and provider to not\\" in a matter of two weeks. She recounted how she rushed her husband to the emergency room, where nurses had said \\"they couldn't believe London was severely autistic — he was so well-behaved.\\" The appeal linked to a now-defunct blog called \\"Autistic London.\\" \\"I am taking care of our son London and now Matt full-time,\\" she wrote. \\"I am applying for any and all assistance available… I NEED YOUR HELP.\\" \\"I love my husband and he has taken care of myself and my son for years and years and now it's time for me to take the helm,\\" she added. \\"I am scared and I am reaching out. I hope I am not coming across trashy or over-reactionary. I must explore every avenue to take care of my family right now.\\" In a YouTube video of Jillian McCabe posted by a family member, she expressed her appreciation for support and funds and donations as the family struggled with Matt's diagnosis and caring for London. \\"You are making this experience livable — versus pulling a Thelma and Louise — which I've totally thought about,\\" a tearful Jillian said with a little laugh. \\"I said it.\\" Matt McCabe's Facebook profile documented the devoted father's medical struggles and family life with London and Jillian. Early photos of a young London — who was diagnosed with severe autism in 2011, according to a post — give way to a smiling young boy sporting a variety of hats. “ It’s absolutely a tragedy.” In blog posts penned by Matt McCabe, he hinted at family troubles. \\"Some of you 'know' and some of you don’t. Jillian and I are living apart right now,\\" he wrote on the blog. \\"Life happens. We are still 'together' but living apart. This has been very difficult, but life is unique, right?\\" But in September, there were signs that the family situation was improving. A YouTube video posted online last month showed Matt, Jillian and London celebrating the boy's sixth birthday at a table surrounded by stuffed-animal party guests. In the video — titled “London McCabe’s Sixth Birthday\\" — Jillian hugs the hat-clad London close as he eyes a candle-lit cupcake, then claps and cheers as he blows out the candle. In September, Matt McCabe posted that his wife had moved back in, and the situation seemed to be improving. \\"Jillian is living with us, too,\\" he wrote. \\"London is pleased as punch. He lays on our laps and puts our hands together. Last night he made the 'mmmwha!' sound and gave his Mommy a kiss. Then he made the same sound and pushed our faces together. He’s all smiles.\\" London McCabe playing with a toy giraffe last November. “He liked big floppy hats and anything that was fuzzy,\\" his uncle said. via Facebook London's uncle said he was \\"really sweet, energetic and a handful.\\" “He liked big floppy hats and anything that was fuzzy. He liked the feel of soft fur and fleece. It was a comfort to him…It was a sensory thing. It was what he was able to latch onto when he was upset. It would calm him down,\\" Andrew McCabe said. “He had a lion that was his favorite. He liked it so much he wore it out – they had to buy him a new one because it was all worn out,” he added. “He liked the water. Ironically enough. He loved the beach. And he loved playing in the water.\\" London carried an iPad with him everywhere, using it for educational games and to watch YouTube. \\"He was very intuitive, very intelligent… just trapped in a mind and a body that couldn’t communicate,\\" his uncle said. Coast Guard spokesman Jonathan Klingenberg said London's body was recovered early Tuesday. He said a good Samaritan had called in after spotting a body from a restaurant and lounge at the Yaquina Bay Bridge, prompting the Coast Guard's 25-foot vessel and fire department to zero in on the location. \\"The fire department got there first and recovered the body,\\" he told NBC News. \\"It's absolutely a tragedy.\\" The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body. She was then arrested. Andrew McCabe said he hoped the tragedy would bring attention to the lack of help for the mentally ill. \\"The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need,\\" he said. — with Gisele Lamarre ||||| Summary:","completion":"A mommy named Jillian had a really hard time because her son named London had autism and couldn't talk, and her husband Matt was very sick. She felt very sad and didn't know what to do. She needed help from others, but it wasn't enough. One day, she did a very bad thing by throwing London off a bridge.

Article:This time four years ago, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan was riding the crest of strong public support. As a village boy who had braved poverty in a politically and economically repressed environment to rise to the pinnacle of academic and political attainment, he was the poster boy of many Nigerians who regarded him as their soul-mate in the fight for justice and equity in the country's governance. On top of his personal attainments he was standing on the platform of the most formidable political machine in Nigeria - the PDP. When the PDP was formed to contest the elections of 1999, it was on the solid foundation of the northern political elite, the club of retired military generals and the established political leadership in the south - minus only the south-west. It has since won every national election comfortably, and so confidently that a former chairman of the party, Vincent Ogbulafor said in 2008 that the party would rule Nigeria \\"for not less than 60 years\\". At the 2011 presidential election Mr Jonathan polled 22 million votes against his major rival's 12 million. It has taken only four years for the glamour to fade from the Jonathan poster. A lack of security, unbridled official corruption, ethnic favouritism and economic mismanagement have been the culprits. In that period there have been large-scale defections of PDP state governors and other leaders to the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), the most prominent being Aminu Tambuwal, speaker of the House of Representatives. And so the PDP is now a minority party in the house which it had dominated since its inauguration. Sola Odunfa: President Jonathan is like a desperate Cristiano Ronaldo before a full house at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium This year's presidential election was initially scheduled to be held on 14 February. If it had been, all indications were that the Jonathan presidency would be history now and the three-times vanquished Gen Muhammadu Buhari would have become president-elect. Fortuitously for the PDP, the election was postponed by six weeks to allow the military to quell the insurgency in the north-east and the electoral commission to improve on its preparation. At least, that was the official explanation. It has turned out to be akin to injury time in a football final. The PDP is firing on all cylinders and President Jonathan is like a desperate Cristiano Ronaldo before a full house at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid. I have covered all PDP election campaigns since the party was founded but I have not seen it fight this vigorously and viciously. No holds barred. So much dirt has been hurled at Gen Buhari that the barrel must be empty by now. My heart bleeds when I read about the alleged huge sums of dollars being distributed among religious leaders and in traditional palaces for mobilisation of support for the president - and I am not comforted when the inevitable denial comes. Nigeria decides 2015 In the past two months the president has felt the need to go beyond his parish church to seek God's assistance. He has been worshipping in various church denominations and attending night vigils in Abuja and Lagos, accompanied by large retinues. It has not come to public knowledge yet that any of the officiating pastors have pronounced certain victory for PDP next Saturday. Should the momentum for Gen Buhari continue and President Jonathan lose, the PDP - the election-winning machine - would be thrown into a situation never imagined. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Four years ago, President Goodluck Jonathan was enjoying strong public support, with many Nigerians considering him as their representative in the fight for justice and equity in the country's governance.

A lack of security, unbridled official corruption, ethnic favoritism, and economic mismanagement have contributed to the decline in his popularity. During this period, there have been large-scale defections from PDP state governors and other leaders to the opposition party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). As a result, the PDP is now a minority party in the house which it had dominated since its inception. The 2015 presidential election saw the PDP and President Jonathan fighting vigorously and viciously to regain their support, resulting in an intense and hostile campaign against their opponent, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari. In an attempt to garner support, President Jonathan has been worshipping in various church denominations and attending night vigils, accompanied by large retinues. However, it has not been publicly disclosed if any of the officiating pastors have pronounced certain victory for the PDP in the elections. If President Jonathan were to lose the election to Gen.

Paragraph: After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

The text mentions that the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services because they couldn't afford private legal counsel.

Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

An obsessive Bob Dylan fan deludes himself into justifying that Chrysler ad, in 5 steps There wasn’t much to talk about in terms of football by the second half of last night’s Super Bowl. So the attention turned to the commercials, even more than usual. And one commercial that got tons of attention was an extended Chrysler ad featuring the usually-reclusive Bob Dylan telling us, in as many words — America rules. Buy an American car. Specifically, buy this Chrysler. For Dylan-philes like myself, this was a somewhat disturbing sight to see. The man who never compromised (which, admittedly, is a romantic myth) was now just another rah-rah American corporate pitch man. But was it really that bad? Can a Dylan superfan actually justify this most egregious sell out? 1. He actually sold out a while ago Back in 2004 Dylan teamed up with Victoria’s Secret, because nothing sells sexy lingerie like a 60-something dude with a pencil mustache. In terms of selling out, this was an inspired and hilarious choice, but it was still selling out. 2. The Chrysler ad was actually less offensive than the Chobani yogurt ad It didn’t get as much attention, but if you’re going to be mad at a Dylan ad from yesterday, make it the clip that featured an essential “Blonde on Blonde” track “I Want You” in a dumb clip trying to sell you tainted yogurt. When I think of “I Want You,” I want to picture a strung out Dylan in Nashville recording at 3 a.m., not some bear destroying a convenience store. This commercial ruins a classic; the Chrysler ad just adds a little shame to a minor late-career song. 3. It was nice to actually hear his voice! Anyone who’s seen Dylan on his Neverending Tour goes in with some expectations, chief among them: his voice is shot, it’s going to be difficult to recognize some songs thanks to new arrangements and he will not address the crowd at all. When have you actually heard the man speak over the past few years, save for Martin Scorsese’s “No Direction Home” documentary? Sure, I’d rather hear him say things that aren’t straight out of some jingoistic pitchman handbook, but still. 4. The man’s defining album is named after a highway, he owes it to the automobile industry. His previous ad was for Cadillac. He’s simply working his way through American car brands, alphabetically. 5. Going corporate is the new going electric. I’m amused by the outrage and angst about Bob Dylan’s Super Bowl ad. It’s like he’s gone electric all over again. — Andy Bechtel (@andybechtel) February 3, 2014 Or the new going country. Or the new going Christian. Or going Christmas.

So I'm check in at the Luxor, I have to pay and additional 12.99 for 24 hour internet service (ok - don't mind). I have to print something out (24 pages, simply word doc, b/w, nothing fancy). First of all the business center closes at 5pm. By the time you stand in the huge line to check-in your room (check in time 3pm) get settled in your room and get your business stuff together the place is closed. So I called the front desk and told her my situation - I needed to print out a 22 page document. I have it either via email or flash stick. She said I can use the computers near the front desk for 5.00 for the first 5 minutes and she incorrectly told me that printing was free. It wasn't. It's 1 per page. WOW! That's alot. So I go prusing around to get more info about the business center so I can be ready right at 7am the next morning. Unfortunately, no one knew more than the center's hours. The point was if I knew the services and charges I can weigh my options on what more affordable and accommodating for my situation. It seems that the 5 for 5 minutes for computer use and 1 - 1.50 per page printed is the norm in most of these strip casino/hotels here. WHAT I DID - I hate that these places try to get over and 5 and 10 us (as opposed to nickel and diming) to death. I used my laptop (with my 12.99 24 hours internet service (which is sometimes slow by the way) and I placed a print order to fedex kinko's at 12:30am for a great and it will be waiting for me at 7am (I got to choose the time and location) THE COST: 2.49 That's it! I need to take a cab and head up north tomorrow so I'll just do a pit stop and pick my doc on the way. Other option - the fedex kinko's is on Hughes Center a block from Bally's.

Question: This article: The seventh and eighth major Nine Inch Nails studio-releases, Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, were released in March and May 2008 respectively. Both albums feature contributions from live-band member Alessandro Cortini. Since the release of Ghosts I–IV, a 25-date tour was announced in several North American cities. Cortini and Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band. The lineup was initially to include Rich Fownes, but before any scheduled performances it was revealed that Justin Meldal-Johnsen would instead be contributing on bass guitar. Supporting acts for the tour include Deerhunter, Crystal Castles, Does It Offend You, Yeah?, Ghostland Observatory, A Place to Bury Strangers, and White Williams. In early June, a tour EP was released for free on the Nine Inch Nails website featuring four songs from the supporting artists and one from Nine Inch Nails. The files are DRM-free MP3s that are fully tagged, and included with the download are desktop wallpapers and a printable tour poster. The band headlined the 2008 Lollapalooza festival, the 2008 Virgin Festival, and the first Pemberton Music Festival. In May 2008, Nine Inch Nails announced that premium seating for all the upcoming 2008 tour shows would be offered in a pre-sale for fans who registered at the official Nine Inch Nails website. In an effort to combat ticket scalpers, each concert ticket will list the purchaser's legal name.

He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted me in the same way. Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman? A) She was over 75. B) She needed all the attention of a baby. C) She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby. D) She lost nearly everything in the war. A:","completion":"C) She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby. Dr. P mentioned that Mrs. West had to be a strong and able woman because her son, Frank, depended on her completely. He was not a normal 37-year-old man, with less of a mind than a baby. This implies that Frank required constant care, attention, and support from his mother, similar to the needs of a baby. Being a 75-year-old woman during the war, Mrs. West faced numerous challenges, including taking care of her mentally challenged son. Her strength and resilience were necessary to provide the care her son needed in such difficult times. While option D also holds some truth since she lost almost everything during the war, the primary reason that Dr. P stated for her strength and ability was the responsibility and care she provided to her son."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: \\"Do you think that he ever went there alone?\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"In evaluating the linguistic acceptability of the sentence \\"Do you think that he ever went there alone?\\", a linguist would consider several factors, including syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistic context. 1. Syntax: From a syntactic standpoint, the sentence is well-formed and adheres to the basic rules and principles of English syntax. The sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), with the subject being \\"you,\\" the verb being \\"think,\\" and the object clause being \\"that he ever went there alone.\\" There is an auxiliary verb \\"do\\" to form the question, and the word \\"ever\\" functions as an adverb specifying the time or frequency of the action expressed by the verb \\"went.\\" This structure aligns with English grammar rules, and thus, a linguist would likely deem the sentence acceptable in terms of syntax. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is understandable and coherent. Each word contributes to the overall meaning, and the context allows for clear interpretation. The speaker is inquiring about the listener's opinion on whether a third person has visited a certain location unaccompanied at any time. As the meaning of the sentence is clear and each word functions meaningfully within the context, a linguist would regard the sentence as semantically acceptable. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics deals with the meaning in context and the subtext of a sentence. In this case, the sentence is presented as a question and is asking for the listener's perspective on a specific matter. The context and intended meaning are clear — the speaker wants to know if the listener believes that a third party has visited a specific place alone. Depending on the context and the relationship between the interlocutors, the sentence could be interpreted as expressing curiosity, concern, or disbelief. Thus, a linguist would likely find the sentence pragmatically acceptable. 4. Sociolinguistic context: Sociolinguistic acceptability pertains to the language variation in different social contexts or cultures. The language used in the sentence is standard English and would be widely understood in various English-speaking communities. However, the sentence could be considered informal in certain formal contexts, as one may expect a more clear or specific phrasing. Nonetheless, a linguist would generally find the sentence acceptable sociolinguistically. Taking these factors into account, a linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"Do you think that he ever went there alone?\\" as acceptable linguistically. The sentence is grammatically correct, semantically clear, pragmatically appropriate, and suitable for most sociolinguistic contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement.

Please answer this question: What constituency did John Major represent while he was Prime Minister?","completion":"John Major, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, represented the constituency of Huntingdon during his tenure as the Prime Minister. He held this position from November 28, 1990, until May 2, 1997. This Conservative politician succeeded Margaret Thatcher as the leader of the Conservative Party and, subsequently, the Prime Minister. An interesting fact about John Major is that he represented two constituencies over his political career. Before becoming the Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon, he was the MP for the neighboring constituency of Huntingdonshire. He was first elected as Huntingdonshire's MP in 1979, and continued to represent it until it was abolished following the parliamentary boundary changes in 1983. Subsequently, he was elected as MP for the newly-formed Huntingdon constituency and held this post until his eventual retirement from the House of Commons in 2001. During his time as Prime Minister, John Major was responsible for the UK's response to the Gulf War and the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which laid the groundwork for the European Union. He also played a pivotal role in advancing the Northern Ireland peace process, starting with the 1993 Downing Street Declaration and continuing with the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Although he faced numerous challenges during his tenure, including economic recession and divisions within his own party, John Major left a lasting mark on the country's political landscape. In summary, while John Major was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1990 to 1997, he represented the constituency of Huntingdon.

Answer based on context: There was interest in his ideas but they remained untested; this changed with the outbreak of the 1688-1697 Nine Years War which placed great emphasis on manoeuvre and siege warfare. Van Coehoorn was present at the capture of Kaiserswerth and Bonn in 1690; his exact role is unclear but Frederick of Prussia was impressed enough to offer him a position as Major-General in his army. He refused and in 1691 William appointed him commander of Namur where he was finally able to implement his ideas on defensive strategy. Namur was divided into the 'City' on the flat northern bank of the River Sambre and the Citadel on high ground to the south controlling access to the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Van Coehoorn strengthened the 'inner' Citadel with new outworks at Fort William and La Casotte but did not have time to do the same for the 'outer' City area. His garrison of 5,000 was also too small for the active defence he had planned, many being poorly-trained Spanish troops with little interest in fighting for the Dutch. Namur was divided into the city and what else?","completion":"Namur was divided into the city and the Citadel. This distinction is significant based on their geographical positions and strategic importance. The 'City' was situated on the flat northern bank of the River Sambre. Its primary advantage seemingly lay in its accessibility, ease of mobility, and potential for trading routes, considering its proximity to the river. Being on flat terrain, the infrastructure might have needed more significant defensive reinforcements, as such an area could be easier to attack. The Citadel, on the other hand, was located on high ground to the south. Its positioning was considered strategically because it controlled access to both the Sambre and Meuse rivers. High ground often provides military advantage due to the broad overview of the landscape, making it easier to monitor approaching enemies. Moreover, it usually requires considerable effort for enemy forces to scale heights, making the Citadel a formidable defensive structure. Understanding those two distinct parts of Namur is critical in picturing how Van Coehoorn implemented his defensive strategy. He managed to strengthen the 'inner' Citadel with new outworks at Fort William and La Casotte. However, due to time constraints, he couldn't do the same for the 'outer' City area. His plans for active defence were also affected by the limited garrison of 5,000, many of whom were poorly-trained Spanish troops with little motivation to fight for the Dutch cause. Therefore, the division of Namur into the 'City' and the 'Citadel', each with its unique geographical and strategic strengths and vulnerabilities, played a crucial role in Van Coehoorn's defensive planning during his time as commander."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you need to write a topic word from the given fact.

Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country.

It is the southern entrance to the city of Alice Springs and in addition to the Todd River it carries the main road and rail access to the South . The Gap was an important sacred site for the Arrernte people and its use as a thoroughfare was avoided prior to the construction of the road and later rail link . The Gap was named by William Mills , the Overland Telegraph line surveyor who discovered the location for Alice Springs . It was named after his former school in Heavitree , Devon . - Richard Hooker (March 1554 3 November 1600) was an English priest in the Church of England and an influential theologian. He was one of the most important English theologians of the sixteenth century. His defence of the role of redeemed reason informed the theology of the seventeenth century Caroline divines and later provided many members of the Church of England with a theological method which combined the claims of revelation, reason and tradition. Scholars disagree regarding Hooker's relationship with what would later be called \\"Anglicanism\\" and the Reformed theological tradition. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the originator of the Anglican \\"via media\\" between Protestantism and Catholicism. However, a growing number of scholars have argued that he should be considered as being in the mainstream Reformed theology of his time and that he only sought to oppose the extremists, (Puritans) rather than moving the Church of England away from Protestantism. - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some east of northern Australia, northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of the Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands.

Other population centres in the state are relatively small. - East Timor or Timor-Leste (Tetum: \\"Timór Lorosa'e\\"), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a sovereign state in Maritime Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - Mainland is a contiguous landmass that is larger and often politically, economically and/or demographically more significant than politically associated remote territories, such as exclaves or oceanic islands situated outside the continental shelf. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - Heavitree is a district of the city of Exeter in Devon, England. It lies to the east of the city centre, and was formerly the first significant village outside the city on the road to London. It was the birthplace of Thomas Bodley, and Richard Hooker, and until 1818 was a site for executions. - A water gap is an opening or notch that flowing water has carved through a mountain range. Water gaps often offer a practical route for road and rail transport to cross mountain ridges. Outside of the US, this is called a canyon or gorge. - The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover , making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania. - The Todd River is an ephemeral river in the southern Northern Territory, central Australia. The origins of the Todd River are in the MacDonnell Ranges, where it flows past the Telegraph Station, almost through the center of Alice Springs, through Heavitree Gap at the southern end of Alice Springs and continuing on for some distance, passing through the western part of the Simpson Desert, as it becomes a tributary of the Hale River, and eventually flowing into Lake Eyre in South Australia. - The Simpson Desert is a large area of dry, red sandy plain and dunes in Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland in central Australia. It is the fourth largest Australian desert, with an area of 176,500 km (68,100 sq mi) and is the world's largest sand dune desert. - The MacDonnell Ranges, a mountain range and an interim Australian bioregion, is located in the Northern Territory, comprising . The range is a long series of mountains located in the centre of Australia, and consist of parallel ridges running to the east and west of Alice Springs. The mountain range contains many spectacular gaps and gorges as well as areas of Aboriginal significance. - Lake Eyre, officially known as Kati ThandaLake Eyre, contains the lowest natural point in Australia, at approximately below sea level (AHD), and, on the rare occasions that it fills, is the largest lake in Australia covering . The shallow endorheic lake is the depocentre of the vast Lake Eyre basin and is found in Northern South Australia, some north of Adelaide. - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south.

Title: Father of the Bride Movie plot: George Banks (Steve Martin) is the owner of an athletic shoe company in San Marino, California. His 22-year-old daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams), returns home from Europe, announcing that she is engaged to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), a man from an upper-class family from Bel-Air, despite them only having known each other for three months. The sudden shock turns the warm reunion into a heated argument between George and Annie, but they quickly reconcile in time for Bryan to arrive and meet them. Despite Bryan's good financial status and likeable demeanour, George takes an immediate dislike to him while his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), accepts him as a potential son-in-law. George and Nina meet Bryan's parents, John and Joanna MacKenzie. Though George feels comfort from John also expressing how shocked he had initially been at Bryan's engagement, he quickly gets into trouble when he begins nosing around and eventually ends up falling into the pool when cornered by the MacKenzies' vicious pet Dobermans. All is forgiven, however, and the Banks meet with an eccentric European wedding coordinator, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) and his assistant, Howard Weinstein (B. D. Wong), where George immediately begins complaining about the price of the extravagant wedding items. The high price, 250 a head, plus the problems of wedding invitations begin to take their toll on George and he becomes slightly insane. The last straw occurs when his wrongly sized suit, which he had struggled to put on, rips when he bends his back.

News article: Lawmakers want to fine carmakers 5,000 a day for not having a privacy policy Cars of the future are likely to be highly advanced machines with knowledge of the driver's every decision: Do you speed? Brake too hard? Wear a seatbelt? All this information could potentially be used against you by insurers, data brokers or hackers — potentially without your knowledge. So House lawmakers are proposing a measure, as part of a draft bill to be debated this week, that would open carmakers up to fines of 5,000 a day if they don't submit a detailed privacy policy to the government. The policies should explain what information a manufacturer collects on drivers, according to the draft text, and lay out the choices consumers have about the use of the data. The automaker would also have to pledge not to keep the driving data for any longer than is necessary for \\"legitimate business purposes.\\" (If that sounds vague to you, you're not alone. We've written about automotive privacy policies previously here.) There are a whole slew of other requirements, such as a proposed ban on hacking into car software. (Security researchers have objected to this section over concerns it could prevent them from detecting and warning of gaps in the companies' code.) Under the draft legislation, car manufacturers could be held liable if they violate any part of their own privacy policies or if they fail to file a privacy policy to begin with. But the maximum penalty automakers face would be limited to 1 million, and they would be shielded from Federal Trade Commission scrutiny for \\"unfair\\" or \\"deceptive\\" acts related to privacy as long as their privacy policies meet all the legislation's requirements. This draft legislation is still in the discussion stages, so much could change. But it says a lot about how lawmakers are going into a burgeoning debate about how to regulate intelligent, connected cars.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

He's not very happy with another group called the DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) because they have a plan for something called a \\"renewable heating scheme.\\" A renewable heating scheme tries to help people use clean energy to heat their homes instead of dirty, polluting energy that's bad for the environment. But the plan made by DUP didn't work very well, and now Máirtín Ó Muilleoir says their new plan to fix it is just like a \\"sticking plaster.\\" Do you know what a sticking plaster is? It's a small band-aid that we use to cover a small cut or scrape. But what if you have a big cut or something more serious? Then a little band-aid won't work. So when Máirtín Ó Muilleoir calls the DUP's plan a \\"sticking plaster,\\" he means that it's too small and not strong enough to fix the big problem with the renewable heating scheme. In our little story, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir wants the DUP to come up with a better plan that will really help fix the renewable heating scheme, and not just cover up the problem. It's important to use clean energy so we can keep the Earth clean and healthy for everyone, including you and your friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hypothesis: The two dogs are brother and sister. .Multi-select problem: Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? Options: - yes. - it is not possible to tell. - no.","completion":"It is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true just based on the premise that the two dogs are running side-by-side on the grass. While the premise sets the scene where two dogs are running together, it does not provide sufficient information to determine their relationship accurately or conclusively prove that they are brother and sister. There could be several alternative explanations for why the two dogs are running side-by-side. Some of these explanations could be: 1. The two dogs could be friends and are just playing together. Animals, particularly dogs, may often play together in open spaces like parks or grassy areas regardless of whether they are related or not. 2. The two dogs could be owned by the same person and are used to spending time together. This information would be necessary to determine if they are related, but it is beyond the scope of the premise. 3. The two dogs could have just crossed paths in the grassy area and decided to run together for a moment. Dogs are often curious and social animals and may engage with each other simply because they find their company enjoyable or intriguing. 4. The two dogs could be participating in a training exercise or a sports event, such as an agility competition. Dogs in such events run side-by-side on grassy fields, but it doesn't necessarily imply that they are siblings. 5. The two dogs could be from different households but are familiar with each other due to regular encounters in their neighborhood or at a nearby park. This familiarity could lead them to play together without being siblings. To determine whether or not the hypothesis that the two dogs are brother and sister is true, additional information would be needed. Factors such as genetic evidence, physical similarities, or their owners' knowledge might help in verifying or disproving the hypothesis.

The Council here is most likely referring to the Council of Nicaea, an important gathering of Christian bishops in the 4th century. Athanasius was a key figure in the early Christian church and his admission to the Council is being discussed in the context of Eusebian bishops objecting to it. Step 2: Evaluate the given statement The statement provided says, \\"Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them.\\" Step 3: Analyze the statement From this statement, we can gather two key pieces of information: 1. There was opposition to Athanasius's admission to the Council by the Eusebian bishops. 2. The only condition under which the Eusebian bishops would permit Athanasius and the other deposed bishops to attend the Council was if they were there to respond to charges against them. Step 4: Formulate an answer Based on the information provided in the statement, we can conclude that Athanasius was not freely permitted admission to the Council. He was only allowed to attend in the capacity of an accused person answering charges against him, as per the objections raised by the Eusebian bishops. Answer: Athanasius was not permitted free admission to the Council due to objections from Eusebian bishops. He was only allowed to attend as an accused person responding to charges against him."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following context: In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies. answer the following question: What is the full name of the character who Link believes is not as heartless as he appears?

Article: Australian scientists say an organic compound used by Indian women to paint dots or bindi on their foreheads could hold the key to a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer. Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease. Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment. \\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,\\"he said. \\"It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.\\" About 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal. Convincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging. Veronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg. \\"I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,\\"said Marock.

Though the phrase \\"tiny little girl\\" can often be used to describe a very young female child, in this specific context, it is referring to a petite, likely young adult woman who is going through the process of giving birth. This woman has a unique characteristic in that she has a medical condition that prevents her from receiving an epidural, which could help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with labor and delivery. Despite her small stature and medical limitations, the woman manages to overcome her physical challenge and delivers a healthy baby boy. This is made evident by the baby's hearty cry and mom's ability to hold her newborn on her belly immediately after the birth. The use of \\"tiny little girl\\" in this story is a narrative device that emphasizes the contrast of her small physical size and the immense personal strength, resilience, and courage she demonstrates during the birthing process.

The now-dead subject of an Oscar-nominated film is causing an argument - and it is not about whether the documentary about her will win. A messy legal fight over who owns the rights to photos shot by Chicago nanny Vivian Maier is raging and the copyright battle threatens to slow, or even stop, new releases of her once-unknown work. Maier, whose life is chronicled in Oscar nominee 'Finding Vivian Maier,' died penniless five years ago. Scroll down for video. Prints of photos taken by nanny Vivian Maier (above) began selling for thousands of dollars after her death. Maier's work became so popular that a documentary about her, Finding Vivian Maier (pictured), was made. John Maloof bought a storage box at auction stuffed full of Maier's photo negatives for 400 in 2007. She died with no will, no obvious heirs and no inkling that the more than 150,000 photographs she snapped in her spare time in Chicago and New York from the 1950s onward would become so prized. Maier's intimate and often-gritty photography, which she made no attempt to sell commercially in her lifetime, focused on everyday people. Since interest in her work exploded, prints of her photographs have sold for thousands of dollars. Now, two men Maier never knew are tussling over who holds the rights to print, sell and display the images she created. Center stage in the dispute is John Maloof, a 33-year-old former Chicago real estate agent who features in and co-directs the documentary. He bought a box full of Maier's negatives at auction for 400 from a repossessed storage locker in 2007. Maloof now owns the vast majority of her work, more than 100,000 images, that are mostly in negatives or undeveloped film. He traced Maier's whereabouts in the Chicago area in 2009, just days after she died at age 83. Maloof defends his project — now his full-time job — of managing his Maier collection. Years going through negatives, and paying for professional restorers and printers has cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. Until recently, he either lost money or just broke even. He said: 'My life is 100 percent on this project. 'It is a blessing and a curse.' Maloof looks at Maier's negatives on a light table at his home in Chicago. The documentary about Maier is up for an Academy Award on Sunday. Maloof (center) said the photos are 'a blessing and a curse' and his life is '100 per cent on this project' It was Virginia-based David Deal, a longtime commercial photographer who read about Maier as he completed a law degree, who sparked the legal fight by filing a notice in a Chicago probate court last summer. Deal's filing identifies a relative of Maier's in France, retired bureaucrat Francis Baille, as Maier's closest relative — a first cousin once removed. Deal claims that makes him Maier's rightful heir. Maloof believes he has copyrights because a different Frenchman he contends is Maier's closest relative, Sylvain Jaussaud, signed over the rights to him. Deal argues that Maloof should have launched probate proceedings himself years earlier to establish who Maier's heirs were. He says it is Maloof's own fault Maier's growing ranks of fans could be deprived of much of her work. Deal said: 'We wouldn't be in this position today if he'd not cut legal corners.' Maloof calls that accusation 'garbage'. He claims a probate proceedings filing wasn't required. But once Deal took that step, it set off a drawn-out legal process. To avoid the legal headaches, an owner of a far smaller collection of Maier's photography sold it all to a Canadian gallery. Maloof has no intention of doing that. He said: 'They don't want to shut us down. I am confident something can be worked out.'

Maier, who passed away five years ago, left no will or obvious heirs. Prints of her photographs have since sold for thousands of dollars and a documentary about her life, \\"Finding Vivian Maier,\\" has been made. John Maloof, a former real estate agent, bought a box full of Maier’s negatives at an auction for 400, back in 2007. He now owns the majority of her work, over 100,000 images. However, Virginia-based photographer David Deal has filed a notice in a Chicago probate court, identifying a relative of Maier's in France, Francis Baille, as her closest relative. This claim is contested by Maloof, who believes that another Frenchman, Sylvain Jaussaud, is Maier's closest relative and has already signed over the rights to her work to him. The legal dispute threatens to slow or even halt new releases of Maier's work, depriving her growing fanbase of access to her compelling photographs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Swedish Empire refers to the Kingdom of Sweden's territorial control of much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries, a time when Sweden was one of the great European powers. The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and the end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. In Swedish history, the period is referred to as \\"stormaktstiden\\", literally meaning \\"the Great Power era\\". - Yakov Karlovich Grot ( Russian : ) ( December 27 ( O.S. December 15 ) 1812 -- June 5 ( O.S. May 24 ) 1893 ) , was a nineteenth - century Russian philologist of German extraction who worked at the University of Helsinki . Grot was a graduate of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum . In his lifetime he gained fame for his translations of German and Scandinavian poetry , his work on the theory of Russian orthography , lexicography , and grammar , and his approach to literary editing and criticism , exemplified in a full edition of the works of Derzhavin ( 1864 -- 1883 ) . His Russkoye Pravopisaniye ( 1878 , 1885 ) ( , Russian orthography ) became the standard textbook of Russian spelling and punctuation until superseded by the decrees of 1917 -- 1918 , although his definition of the theoretical foundations remains little changed to this day . Shortly before his death , he assumed the compilation of Academic dictionary of Russian ( 1891 -- 1923 ) , which , although continued by Aleksey Shakhmatov , was never to be completed . He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1858 , its chairman from 1884 , and its vice-president from 1889 . He was appointed Russian - language tutor to the future tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. His spelling primers \`\` reduced words to historical hieroglyphs of a kind , mismatched with the living spoken language of most Russians '' ; later linguists like Baudouin de Courtenay and Filipp Fortunatov promoted reforms that would make spelling a better reflection of spoken language . - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - The University of Helsinki (, , abbreviated UH) is a university located in Helsinki, Finland since 1829, but was founded in the city of Turku (in Swedish \\"Åbo\\") in 1640 as the \\"Royal Academy of Turku\\", at that time part of the Swedish Empire. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes. - The Royal Academy of Turku (or \\"Åbo Kungliga Akademi\\", ) was the first university in Finland, and the only Finnish university that was founded when the country still was a part of Sweden. In 1809, after Finland became a Grand Duchy under the suzerainty of the Russian Tzar, it was renamed the \\"Imperial Academy of Turku\\". In 1828, after the Great Fire of Turku, the institution was moved to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the Grand Duchy's capital. It was finally renamed the University of Helsinki when Finland became a sovereign nation-state in 1917. - Helsinki is the capital and largest city of Finland. It is in the region of Uusimaa, in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of 1,214,210, and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located some north of Tallinn, Estonia, east of Stockholm, Sweden, and west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities. - Turku is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Southwest Finland. Turku, as a town, was settled during the 13th century and founded most likely at the end of the 13th century, making it the oldest city in Finland. It quickly became the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire (1809) and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812), Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains a regional capital and an important business and cultural center. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.

She was used as a gunship to collect naval assets of the defeated Confederacy. Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one?","completion":"The text referring to USS Gamage (1864) falls under the category of a \\"mean of transportation.\\" In this specific context, it represents a naval vessel that served a significant role during the American Civil War. As a large steamer acquired by the Union Navy, the USS Gamage functioned as a gunship used to collect the naval assets of the defeated Confederacy. USS Gamage was a steam-powered ship, which was a common type of propulsion system used in naval vessels during that time. Steam power revolutionized maritime transportation by providing a reliable and efficient way to propel ships through the water. By leveraging the power of steam, warships could achieve greater speeds and overcome the limitations of wind and sail, making them more agile and versatile in their operations. During the final months of the American Civil War, the Union Navy sought to strengthen its fleet by incorporating new ships like the USS Gamage. As a large gunship, its primary mission was to retrieve and secure naval assets from the defeated Confederate forces. These assets included vessels, weaponry, and other valuable equipment that could be used to bolster the Union's naval capabilities or prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. USS Gamage's role in the conflict highlights the strategic importance of naval power during that era. As a means of transportation, the ship enabled the Union Navy to project its power and maintain control over key shipping lanes and coastal areas. The ship's operations in collecting Confederate naval assets further underscored the importance of controlling and securing maritime resources during times of war. In conclusion, the text about USS Gamage (1864) refers to the category of a mean of transportation. Specifically, it refers to a significant naval vessel employed during the American Civil War to fulfill essential functions for the Union Navy. The USS Gamage serves as an important historical example of the role and impact of steam-powered ships in warfare and maritime transportation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Solve this instance: Problem: if the radius of a circle is increased by 20 % then the area is increased by : Student:","completion":"Teacher: Alright, let's break down the task and solve it step by step. Step 1: Understand the given information - We know that the radius of a circle is increased by 20%. - We need to find how much the area is increased. Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a circle - The formula for the area of a circle is A = π * r^2, where A is the area, and r is the radius of the circle. Step 3: Calculate the new radius - Since the radius is increased by 20%, the new radius can be calculated as (1 + 20/100) * r = 1.2 * r. Step 4: Calculate the new area - Using the formula for the area of a circle (A = π * r^2), we can calculate the new area using the new radius: A_new = π * (1.2 * r)^2. Step 5: Compare the original and new area - In order to find the percentage by which the area is increased, we can use the following formula: [(A_new - A) / A] * 100. - Replace A_new with the expression we found in step 4 (π * (1.2 * r)^2) and A with the original area formula (π * r^2). - The formula then becomes: [((π * (1.2 * r)^2) - (π * r^2)) / (π * r^2)] * 100. Step 6: Simplify the formula - By simplifying the formula, we get: [((1.44 * π * r^2) - (π * r^2)) / (π * r^2)] * 100. - Further simplifying, we get: [(0.44 * π * r^2) / (π * r^2)] * 100. - Finally, the π * r^2 terms cancel out, and we are left with: 0.44 * 100 = 44. So, when the radius of a circle is increased by 20%, the area is increased by 44%."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Fact 1: Damming a river can cause a lake to form. Fact 2: Beavers build dams. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What animal can help lakes to form?\\" with the following options: - mussels - the trout - sea urchins - eukyarotes - the duck - The beaver - amphibians - the otter Answer:","completion":"The beaver Step 1: The question specifically asks us to find the animal that can help lakes to form. Step 2: In this case, Fact 1 states that \\"Damming a river can cause a lake to form.\\" This implies that any animal associated with building dams could potentially contribute to lake formation. Step 3: Fact 2 states \\"Beavers build dams.\\" This directly connects the action of dam building to a specific animal, the beaver. Step 4: Combining these facts, it becomes clear that beavers have the ability to indirectly create lakes by damming rivers. Therefore they fit the criteria of an animal that can help lakes to form. Step 5: Looking at the options provided, \\"The beaver\\" is among them and is selected as the correct choice, based on the interpreted facts and logical reasoning. None of the other animals listed have any known link to dam building or lake creation, hence they are disregarded.

On the call and response track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, a funky drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by surf music and grunge. J.R. Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that \\"Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies. I'm not part of that club, it says.\\" For PopMatters's Matt Cibula, the repeated line \\"Hold what you've got\\" is the Deals' reminder to themselves to keep the Breeders intact henceforth.On \\"London Song\\", Jim Abbott at The Orlando Sentinel said the syncopated guitar performance complements Title TK's \\"world-weary attitude,\\" just as the sisters' \\"tough lost years ...

The Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879.

Since both terms on the right side have the variable \\"l\\", we can combine them. 592*l - 568*l = (592 - 568)*l = 24*l Now the equation becomes: 456 = 24*l Step 2: Solve for l by isolating the variable. To solve for l, we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. Since l is currently being multiplied by 24, we'll divide by 24 to isolate l. 456 / 24 = 24*l / 24 Step 3: Do the calculations and find the value of l. 456 / 24 = 19 So, l = 19."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the name of the prison Flynn breaks out of?

Second question: How much money will I have to save up to travel all over India? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is asking for tips and tricks to save money on accommodations in India (i.e., hotels), whereas the second question is inquiring about the overall budget required to travel across India, which includes transportation, meals, and sightseeing, along with accommodations. Task 1: Answer the first question (Travel hacks to save money on Indian hotels) Step 1: Research and list various ways to save money on hotels in India. Step 2: Identify which of the ways are applicable specifically to India or may provide extra benefits in the Indian context. Here are a few travel hacks to save money on Indian hotels: 1. Book hotels during the off-season when prices are lower due to fewer tourists. 2. Utilize hotel booking websites and apps to compare prices and find the best deals. 3. Consider using alternative accommodations like homestays, guesthouses, hostels, and Airbnb. 4. Make use of available discounts, such as booking well in advance, using cashback websites, or applying relevant promo codes. 5. Be flexible with your travel dates and location when searching for accommodations, as rates can vary significantly. 6. If you're a frequent traveler, sign up for various hotel loyalty programs to earn points and obtain discounted rates in the future. Task 2: Answer the second question (How much money to save up to travel all over India?) Step 1: Define the scope of the trip (how many cities/places, duration, and travel style). Step 2: Research the average cost for each aspect of the trip (transportation, accommodations, food, sightseeing). Step 3: Calculate a rough budget estimate based on the information gathered. There is no fixed amount to save up for traveling all over India, as it depends on the scope of your trip and travel preferences. Factors like the number of cities you plan to visit, duration of your trip, choice of accommodations, transportation facilities, and personal extravagance will ultimately impact your budget. A rough range for a backpacker-style budget can be from 20 to 35 per day (INR 1,500 to 2,500), while mid-range budgets might be in the range of 50 to 100 per day (INR 3,500 to 7,000).

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen.

Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment.

Unprepared to navigate the freedoms and secular life that New York offered, Leah found herself facing many challenges that would come to define her journey. Young and vulnerable, Leah was pulled into a life of prostitution, which only further exacerbated her emotional turmoil. She also began to engage in self-harming behaviors, such as cutting, in order to cope with her difficult circumstances. Additionally, Leah ended up having an affair with a married professor – a disastrous, morally fraught decision that she would come to regret. Despite her struggles, Leah refused to give in to the darkness that threatened to consume her.

That path led her to apply for and win a prestigious scholarship at Harvard University. At Harvard, Leah was afforded the opportunity to start anew and reshape her life. She threw herself into her studies, and her hard work eventually paid off when she graduated. The dark chapters of her past were now replaced with academic accomplishments and the seeds of a brighter future. Leah's journey took another significant turn when she met the man who would become her true love. This love would become instrumental in helping to heal the scars of her past and would provide the stable, supportive partnership she needed to continue moving forward. The couple eventually married and welcomed a daughter into their lives – a symbol of hope, redemption, and new beginnings. Leah Vincent's inspiring journey is a testament to the transformative power of determination, resilience, and self-belief. Faced with some of life's most daunting challenges, Leah chose not to be consumed by them, but to overcome them.

Given the context: Why did he need better evaluation? Answer:","completion":"Cameron needed better evaluation for the athletes for several reasons that can be attributed to achieving improved outcomes in the sporting environment, enhancing their individual growth, and optimizing the overall team performance. By dividing the athletes into different classes, Cameron demonstrated an understanding of the benefits of a targeted and specialized approach to athlete evaluation and development. Here are some of the main reasons why Cameron sought better evaluation: 1. Identification of individual strengths and weaknesses: By dividing the athletes into different classes, Cameron can focus on assessing and identifying their unique attributes, including their strengths and areas that need improvement. This will allow them to work on tailored programs and develop strategies that help them advance their skills and minimize their weaknesses. 2. Personalized training and development: Once the athletes' individual characteristics and performance levels have been determined, the coaching staff can create specialized training programs that cater to their specific needs. This approach to training will enable athletes to progress at their own pace and ensure optimal development in their respective disciplines. 3. Balanced team composition: Cameron's divide-and-evaluate method will help identify the right mix of skill sets required for a strong and cohesive team. By understanding each athlete's potential, Cameron can assemble a well-rounded group that complements each other's abilities and supports the overall goals of the team. 4. Early detection of talent: This method of evaluation can help in identifying promising athletes early on in their sporting careers. By grouping them according to their skill levels and adequately evaluating their progress, Cameron can provide the necessary guidance to nurture their talents and help them reach their full potential. 5. Better performance tracking: Evaluating the athletes in a targeted manner will allow for more accurate and comprehensive performance measurement. Coaches and administrators can track each athlete's progress, compare it with other athletes in the same class, and adjust the training accordingly to ensure that they are all on the right path. 6. Increased motivation and engagement: Athletes who feel understood and valued by their coaches are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their training. By investing time and effort in understanding each athlete's unique capabilities, Cameron is fostering a positive and supportive environment that encourages growth and success. 7. Greater competitiveness: In the world of sports, every edge counts, and better evaluation plays a vital role in staying ahead of the competition. By having a deeper understanding of the athletes and consistently working on improving their abilities, the team will be better prepared for competitions and will increase its chances of performing well.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. Now, I have a new situation: Italy had two distinct regions. Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Answer this question please: Which region had more species go extinct? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be inferred that the region with more species going extinct would be the Northern region of Italy. The rationale for this conclusion is rooted in the relationship between abiotic stress and biodiversity. Abiotic stress, which includes factors such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, and pollution, has a significant impact on the survival and reproduction of species. In environments with high levels of abiotic stress, species must adapt to these challenging conditions in order to survive. As a result, only a select few species with the necessary adaptive traits can withstand the abiotic stress in these environments, leading to lower overall biodiversity. In contrast, environments with low levels of abiotic stress offer more favorable conditions for a wider variety of species to thrive. With fewer survival challenges to overcome, more species can coexist and support larger populations in these low-stress environments, resulting in higher biodiversity. In the context of your example, the Northern region of Italy is characterized by high levels of abiotic stress. As a result, species in this region face greater challenges to their survival and reproduction, making them more susceptible to population decline, endangerment, and ultimately, extinction. On the other hand, the Southern region of Italy experiences low levels of abiotic stress, providing a more hospitable environment for a larger number of species to flourish and maintain stable populations. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the Northern region of Italy, with its higher levels of abiotic stress, had more species go extinct compared to the Southern region, where abiotic stress was minimal."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the year 1998, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffered severe sexual abuse and traumas as a boy (played by Logan Lerman) and a teenager (played by John Patrick Amedori), blacks out frequently, often at moments of high stress.

In the moment the disrespect occurs, let him know you will not tolerate it. You do not have to be aggressive or mean. Simply state your needs in a calm fashion When your boyfriend is being difficult, say so in the moment. Calmly let him know what he's saying is not respectful and you don't appreciate it. Do this in a calm fashion to avoid escalating the argument. For example, your boyfriend is on your case about you going out with friends from work because he feels these friends are not responsible. Say something like, \\"I appreciate your concerns, but I know how to stay safe. I'm allowed to have a social life and I need you to respect that.\\" If your boyfriend is chronically disrespectful, he may not always listen when you assert yourself. Instead of hearing your needs and backing off, he may become hostile or even aggressive. For example, \\"I don't care what you think you need. I don't want you going out with those girls from the office.\\" In this case, just walk away. You need to back up your words with behavior. If you want your boyfriend to respect your social life, and he isn't, show him you won't tolerate this lack of respect.

A political risk insurance is necessary. This could take the form of mezzanine financing at EU interest rates - very close to zero,\\" he said in an interview published on Monday. \\"I stand ready. There are concrete investment ideas, for example in agriculture and infrastructure projects. I would put in 1 billion. This must generate a profit. My foundation would benefit from this ... Private engagement needs strong political leadership.\\" The Hungarian-born hedge fund magnate, who made his name betting against the pound in 1992, also put the chance of Greece leaving the euro zone at a third. Last week he put it at 50:50. Michael Vachon, spokesman for Soros, said on Monday in a statement: \\"Soros said he would consider investments in Ukraine if Western leaders demonstrated that they were prepared to 'do whatever it takes' to save Ukraine, including providing adequate budgetary support and political risk insurance. \\"Under those conditions, Soros said he would review investments in the energy, agriculture and information technology sectors.\\" (Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Catherine Evans) ||||| said Monday he was ready to invest 1 billion in Ukraine if the West promised to help the embattled country. \\"Ukraine is defending the EU from Russian aggression\\" and helping its development will weaken Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Hungarian-born philanthropist said in remarks published in German by the Austrian business daily Der Standard. He said Ukraine needed 50 billion euros to get itself back on its feet, and said he was prepared to pump 1 billion (922 million euros) into agriculture and infrastructural projects. Ukraine is at the edge of bankruptcy hit by the triple whammy of the war in its industrial east, a deep economic recession and the record devaluation of its currency. Its public debt likely to reach 94 percent of its GDP in 2015. Soros said his investments \\"should make a profit \\", which would go to his foundation rather than him personally. \\"The West can help Ukraine by making it more attractive to investors by giving them insurance against political risk,\\" he said. \\"That could take the form of financing very close to the European interest rates, which are very close to zero.\\" Ukrainian investment analysts ICU only predict a return to growth in 2017, and a sharp drop in GDP of 7.6 percent this year. VIENNA: |||||Summary:","completion":"George Soros is a man with lots and lots of money - we call him a \\"billionaire investor\\". He thinks the group of countries called the EU (European Union) is not doing the right thing because they are not helping another country called Ukraine. He believes that the EU should give Ukraine money, without expecting to get it back, to help them through difficult times. Soros also said that if the EU and other Western countries promise to help Ukraine, he would spend a lot of his own money, almost like putting it in a piggybank in Ukraine. He pointed out a few things Ukraine could do with the money, like farming and building stuff, and mentioned that this money would be like an investment that would also end up helping his foundation, which supports many good causes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What will be the result of people not hiding their emotions probably? Options: - not enough information - they will never be sad again - they will be less hopeful for the future - they will lead healthier lives A:","completion":"they will lead healthier lives"},{"prompt":"The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America, is a 1964 work of literary criticism written by Leo Marx and published by Oxford University Press, trope notably appears in Henry David Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" (1854) when the whistling sound of a steam locomotive disrupts the natural landscape of which lake in Concord, Massachusetts in the which country?

Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract. Abstract: To evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the control of human sweating, we studied six subjects during 40 min of cycle-ergometer exercise (60% maximal O2 consumption) at 22 degrees C 2 h after oral administration of placebo or nonselective beta-blockade (BB, 80 mg propranolol). Internal temperature (esophageal temperature, Tes), mean skin temperature (Tsk), local chest temperature (Tch), and local chest sweat rate (msw) were continuously recorded. The control of sweating was best described by the slope of the linear relationship between msw and Tes and the threshold Tes for the onset of sweating. The slope of the msw-Tes relationship decreased 27% (P less than 0.01), from 1.80 to 1.30 mg X cm-2 X min-1 X degree C-1 during BB. The Tes threshold for sweating (36.8 degrees C) was not altered as the result of BB. These data suggest that BB modified the control of sweating via some peripheral interaction. Since Tsk was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced during BB exercise, from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees C, we evaluated the influence of the reduction in local skin temperature (Tsk) in the altered control of sweating. Reductions in Tch accounted for only 45% of the decrease in the slope of the msw-Tes relationship during BB. Since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with BB, as estimated from the energy balance equation, was also reduced 18%, compared with control exercise, we concluded that during BB the reduction in sweating at any Tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local Tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland. Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?","completion":"Yes, the abstract contains numerical data. The presence of numerical data can be observed in various instances throughout the abstract: 1. Six subjects were studied. 2. The exercise duration was 40 minutes. 3.

Mean skin temperature (Tsk) significantly reduced during BB exercise from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees Celsius (P less than 0.05). 9.

Visit the official websites of the identified hostels to verify room availability and potentially discover better deals. 4. Contact the hostels directly: If you are unable to find the necessary information on the hostel's website, consider contacting them directly via email or phone. Typically, hostel staff can provide you with the most up-to-date information on room availability and may even offer last-minute or unadvertised deals. 5. Evaluate cancellations or last-minute changes: Keep in mind that room availability may change rapidly, especially during peak travel seasons or special events. Regularly check the availability of your preferred hostels to stay informed about any cancellations or last-minute changes that may free up additional spaces. 6. Book your accommodation: Once you have gathered all the necessary information and found a hostel with available rooms that meet your preferences, go ahead and book your accommodation. Make sure to review any booking policies and confirm your reservation to avoid any misunderstandings or issues during your stay. 7. Consider alternative accommodation options: In the event that you can't find available hostels in Villa la Angostura, explore other types of accommodations such as hotels, guest houses, or Airbnb rentals. Be flexible with your preferences and remember that last-minute options are often available, even if they weren't initially your top choice. Remember to take into account your budget, travel preferences, and desired location when searching for hostels in Villa la Angostura.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In this satire of the commercialization and 'lightheartedness' of war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, an assassin sent to to 'Turaqistan' to take out Omar Sharif, who is doing some oil business that will spell trouble for the former Vice President of the US's own company. In addition to this, Hauser must juggle his fake position as a trade show producer, a wedding for pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff), and a nosy Liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). Assessing the technical aspects: - The acting (by the main characters,at least) was good, as was to be expected. Some of John Cusack's dialogue was quite obviously not written for him as he often seemed uncomfortable saying it. . . maybe unrealistic is more accurate. Joan put forth a great, and often hilarious, performance. Marisa Tomei, while I've never been a big fan of hers, was more than suitable for the role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was pretty terrible. They needed an attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian, or whatever that accent was supposed to be) pop-star. Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her. - Like I said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and mismatched at points, especially John Cusack's dialogue. Not much of it, mind, but some. The story also got a bit ludicrous at points, which is fine for a satire to a point, but it took it to a whole new level here. Luckily, the Cusacks and Tomei keep a relatively cool, calm demeanor throughout, and that makes a nice even mix of the craziness of the film and the levelheadedness of the actors. - Joshua Seftel, who previously had a drought of real credits to his name, did a fine job with a rather wide-spectrum film. He handled the small (10 million) budget very well, stretching it to make it appear to be much more. Seftel also managed to nicely blend the humour of the story. . . with the painful and hard-to-watch parts of the real war (including slaughter of civilians, etc.). - As far as the general satire goes, its exaggerated look on the commercializing of war is very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads on the U.S. tanks. At points, it becomes a little too much, but, in the end, it still accurate portrays what it's going for an a young 'Mel Brooks'-type of style. Overall, the film is very well made for the meager budget and it's definitely worthy of a look. It won't go down as one of the great satires of cinema, but it's certainly not the worst. 7/10.

Possible answers: be lost forever, be found, yell for Casey The answer is:","completion":"It is not possible to definitively determine what will happen to Casey based solely on the information provided in the question and context. However, we can explore the different possible answers and analyze the likelihood of each outcome based on various assumptions and scenarios. 1. Casey might be lost forever. In this scenario, we might assume that Casey has gone missing or is in danger, prompting Bailey to inquire about their whereabouts with Casey's neighbor. If Casey cannot be located or contacted through any means and there is no information about their whereabouts, there remains a possibility that Casey might be lost forever. However, this would be an extreme outcome, and one would typically expect more indicators or signs before assuming the worst. 2. Casey might be found. If Bailey's inquiry leads to any useful information about Casey's whereabouts or recent activities, it is possible that Casey will be found. For instance, Casey's neighbor may recall seeing or speaking with them recently and provide insight into their current location. Additionally, Bailey could gather more information from other sources, such as friends, family, or local authorities. The probability of this outcome largely depends on how much information Bailey is able to gather and Casey's actual situation. 3. Someone might yell for Casey. Yelling for Casey could occur if Bailey or someone else present in the situation believes that Casey is nearby but not visible. For example, if Casey's neighbor mentions that they saw Casey in their backyard recently, Bailey might decide to try calling out to Casey. This method might work to get Casey's attention if they are indeed close by and can hear the shouting. However, whether this ultimately leads to finding Casey or resolving the issue at hand is uncertain. In conclusion, the ultimate outcome for Casey depends on various factors, such as the reason behind Bailey's inquiry, the information gathered from Casey's neighbor and other sources, and Casey's actual situation. Each possible answer presents a different scenario that could unfold, but based on the information provided, we cannot definitively determine what will happen to Casey. It is crucial to gather more relevant information and context to better understand Casey's situation and assess the likelihood of each potential outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The five guests are test pilot Lance Schroeder (Richard Long); newspaper columnist Ruth Bridges (Julie Mitchum); psychiatrist Dr. David Trent (Alan Marshal), who specializes in hysteria; Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig), who works for one of Loren's companies; and the house's owner Watson Pritchard (Elisha Cook). Pritchard disapproves of Loren's use of the house for his \\"party,\\" making it unclear how Loren acquired access to the house in the first place. Arriving late at night in separate funeral cars with a hearse leading the procession, Loren's guests are told the rules of the party, and each is given a .38 ACP caliber pistol for protection. Forced to attend the party, Loren's wife tries to warn the guests that her husband is psychotic, causing them to be very suspicious of him. Nora becomes convinced that he's trying to kill her when she keeps seeing frightening ghosts, including the ghost of Annabelle, who had apparently hanged herself some time during the night.

I have a new situation: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together. They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. But I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. What is an answer for this question: Which friend had to start drinking skim milk? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Tom was the one who had hypertension and was advised by his doctor to change his diet.

The two have been taken to Ramo Verde military jail, family members say. The Supreme Court, which critics say is dominated by government loyalists, said it had received intelligence reports alleging the two were trying to flee. The court also said that it had revoked Mr Ledezma's and Mr López's house arrest because they had made political statements. The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, said he was \\"deeply concerned\\" that the pair had been taken back into custody. The move comes just two days after a controversial vote for a constitutional assembly saw violence on the streets, with at least 10 people killed. President Nicolás Maduro convened the assembly to rewrite Venezuela's constitution amid spiralling anti-government protests on 1 May. He argued that the move would create peace and foster dialogue by bringing together different sectors of Venezuela's polarised society. But the opposition accused the president of trying to rewrite the constitution in order to maximise his power and sideline the opposition-controlled legislature. They boycotted the vote and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets in protest. The election was condemned by Latin American leaders, the European Union and the US. The day of the election was the deadliest so far since the current wave of protest began. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Monday that the US had imposed sanctions on President Maduro and called him a \\"dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people\\". Mr López was taken from his home at 12:27 local time (04:27GMT) on Tuesday, his wife, Lilian Tintori, wrote on Twitter. A video posted showed him being taken away by members of the Venezuelan intelligence service, Sebin. Lilian Tintori wrote that she would hold President Nicolás Maduro responsible if something were to happen to her husband. The daughter of Mr Ledezma, Vanessa Ledezma, also posted a video of her father, wearing pyjamas, being taken away by the Sebin. A woman can be heard shouting \\"They're taking Ledezma, they're taking Ledezma, dictatorship!\\" The European Union criticised the detentions as a step in the wrong direction and Chile's foreign minister said they \\"sent an abysmal signal\\". The US also condemned the arrests. Republican Senator Marco Rubio noted that US Vice-President Mike Pence has spoken to Mr López last Friday, and characterised the arrests as a response to the sanctions placed on Mr Maduro. Both Mr Ledezma and Mr López were key figures in the wave of protests which swept through Venezuela in 2014 in which 43 people from both sides of the political divide were killed. They have played a less prominent role in the most recent protests because they have been under house arrest but their video messages still get reported and shared widely on opposition websites.

Now more than ever, people are embracing the opportunity to express their individuality through their hair, makeup, and personal style. This article aims to inspire you to experiment with daring hair colors, creative hairstyles, and dramatic, theatrical makeup to make an unforgettable and unique statement! Step 1: Choose a Bold Hair Color To begin your journey into self-expression, you first need to choose a hair dye color that catches your eye and suits your personality. There are countless shades and combinations to choose from, ranging from pastel hues, vibrant neons, or a mix of different colors. Be brave and let your creativity guide you. Step 2: Preparing Your Hair for Dyeing Before you dive into the dyeing process, assess the health of your hair – damaged hair might require some deep conditioning first. If your desired color requires bleaching, it's crucial to approach this step cautiously. Consult with a professional if you're unsure about how to bleach your hair safely. Step 3: Dye Your Hair Once you're ready to dive in, follow the instructions on the hair dye packaging, taking care to protect your skin and clothes from spills and stains. For a precise application and even distribution, use tools like brushes and gloves. If you're going for multiple colors, carefully section your hair and use foil to separate the shades. Step 4: Flaunting Your Creative Hairstyle Now that your hair is radiating your chosen color(s), it's time to showcase it with a creative hairstyle that complements your shade. Experiment with braids, twists, space buns, or even an edgy, asymmetrical cut. Remember, the sky is the limit when it comes to expressing your unique personality through your hair. Step 5: Accentuate Your Look with Dramatic, Theatrical Makeup To complete your striking makeover, it's time to add bold makeup that draws attention and enhances your entire ensemble. Theatrical makeup typically involves strong contours, vibrant pigment, and striking geometric designs. Don't be afraid to play with intense eye and lip colors, patterns, or even add some glitter and gems to your makeup routine. There are no rules when it comes to creativity. Conclusion: Embracing creativity in your hair and makeup allows you to experiment with different styles, colors, and textures, illustrating your unique personality to the world.

Nullah The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Rainbow Whispers\\" Genre: Drama, Adventure, Musical Setting: \\"Rainbow Whispers\\" is set in the late 1940s, in the picturesque yet isolated rural landscape of Northern Australia. The local residents live a simple, self-sustained life, farming and herding their livestock. The region, rich in its cultural history and diversity, also comprises a strong Indigenous Australian presence. Plot Summary: The story revolves around Nullah, an Indigenous Australian teenager with a passion for music, especially his harmonica. He spends his days working on his family's farm, while immensely cherishing the evenings, when he can play his melodious tunes. Nullah is poignantly yet brilliantly inspired by the famous \\"Over the Rainbow\\" song from the classic movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (1939). As a child, Nullah had heard the song from his mother's harmonica, and now, he pursues his passion for music in her memory, as she passed away in a tragic accident few years prior. He dreams of leaving his small town and performing on stage before a worldwide audience, sharing his harmonica's version of \\"Over the Rainbow.\\" However, Nullah's desire to pursue music is hindered by his harsh uncle, Barkley, who is the head of the family and insists that the boy should focus entirely on the family farm's well-being. Barkley disapproves of Nullah's inclination towards music, considering it unprofitable and a distraction from work. One day, while playing his harmonica, Nullah encounters Amelia, a young and spirited journalist from the city, who is visiting the area to document the region's rich heritage and vibrant Indigenous culture. She discovers Nullah's talent and is immensely impressed by his musical prowess. Amelia reveals to Nullah about a music contest that is being held in the city, where the winner gets a grand scholarship to attend a prestigious music academy. Seeing this as a potential opportunity for Nullah, she encourages him to participate despite Barkley's obvious disapproval. Together, they embark on an emotional yet adventurous journey to the city, exploring the vast and enchanting Australian outback on their way. Throughout their journey, Nullah and Amelia become friends, sharing their stories and dreams with one another. Along the way, they also encounter various inspiring characters, including other Indigenous musicians, who help hone Nullah's skills and teach him the importance of embracing his cultural identity through music. Finally reaching the city, Nullah performs in the contest, playing a soul-stirring rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" on his harmonica. Moved to tears, the audience and the contest judges are thoroughly enchanted by his heartfelt performance. Against all odds, Nullah wins the music scholarship, bringing him closer to his far-reaching dreams. Back in their hometown, Amelia's extensive documentation of Nullah's story and the region's rich cultural background inspires an increasing appreciation for Indigenous music and heritage. Through this newfound appreciation and his journey, Nullah's family, including his uncle Barkley, learn to understand and support his musical aspirations. Rainbow Whispers is an inspiring, engaging, and sentimental tale that highlights the importance of following one's dreams and staying true to one's cultural roots, while also exploring the deep connections between friendship, family, and the unifying power of music."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. After reading the above, is \\"The NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who recommended that the President designate Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act?\\"?

David Lynch was spared jail after hitting a cyclist while he was speeding, causing 'catastrophic' injuries. A police officer who caused 'catastrophic life-changing' injuries to a cyclist while responding to an emergency call in his van has been spared jail. David Lynch, 31, was found guilty of dangerous driving earlier this year for hitting Joseph Belmonte after driving over a humpback bridge in Hackney, east London at 68mph in a 30mph zone. Horrified eye witnesses described. hearing a ‘loud bang’ before the musician was propelled onto the bonnet. then thrown towards a tree like a ‘rag doll’. Mr Belmonte, who was just a week away. from releasing his debut album, spent nine days in an induced coma. after suffering brain, spinal, and facial injuries, as well as a broken. right arm and finger. Lynch,. a former British Transport Police officer, who had since resigned from. his job, was today given an eight-month suspended jail sentence at. Southwark Crown Court. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, sentencing. Lynch to eight months in prison suspended for 12 months, said: 'What has. weighed significantly with me is your intense guilt, remorse and utter. distress at the injuries you caused that day, coupled with your. immediate and appropriate response not only at the scene but in your. determined efforts afterwards, until you were told it was inappropriate,. to seek information about the welfare of Mr Belmonte.' Lynch, from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, was also ordered to carry out 240 hours. of community service and told he must be electronically tagged and. subject to a 7pm to 6am curfew for 12 weeks. He was also banned from. driving for 15 months and ordered to pay £1,000 towards prosecution. costs. The court heard how Lynch and front seat passenger PC Gary Thomas, had been racing to assist a colleague at Hackney Downs station on March 31 last year. Lynch had come on to the rise of the unmarked bridge in Queensbridge Road at 68mph while in a 30mph zone. He had reduced his speed to 63mph. before his vehicle 'took off' and became 'airborne' - landing so hard. that it made gouges in the road. The police officer 'lost control' of the van, which swerved to the left, hitting the kerb, and then to the right, hitting Mr Belmonte from behind at a speed of 45mph. The judge described the speed at which he drove over the bridge as ‘very dangerous’. he said: ‘You lost control of the vehicle,. first steering to the left and clipping the curb and then to the right. and hitting Mr Belmonte from behind at a speed of 45mph.' The court heard that Mr Belmonte, 31, who was not wearing a helmet, was in a medically induced coma for nine days after the collision and suffered spine, knee, brain and facial injuries. Southwark Crown Court where the British Transport police officer was given a suspended sentence. He had a broken right elbow and little finger which resulted in him having to learn to play the guitar again. He also suffered severe psychological effects and his head and associated brain injury mean he is likely to be left with permanent cognitive impairment. Lynch had already pleaded guilty to careless driving but denied one charge of dangerous driving. Judge Pegden said Mr Belmonte had suffered 'catastrophic life- changing' injuries and his career as a musician had been 'ruined'. 'He still suffers major disabilities and faces further significant surgery and treatment,' he said. The court heard that the married father-of-two had two previous speeding convictions. In 2005, before he joined British Transport Police, he was banned from driving for two months and fined £250 for driving at 98mph on a motorway. In 2008, he was handed a fixed penalty notice for driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone. Lynch, from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, was also ordered to carry out 240 hours of community service and told he must be electronically tagged and subject to a 7pm to 6am curfew for 12 weeks. Judge Pegden said he was persuaded to suspend the. sentence by what he described as Lynch’s ‘intense guilt, remorse, and. utter distress’ at the injuries he caused Mr Belmonte and a ‘raft of. fine character references’. He said: ‘In my view you have shown. these general characteristics over the last 18 months and no doubt will. bear them for the rest of your life.’ The court was told he had driven 500 response calls in an 18-month period since qualifying as a response driver. Lynch had told jurors he had had no time. to react to the cyclist after his vehicle left the ground as he came. over the brow of the hill. He said: ‘As I tried to gain control of it in that split second I saw the cyclist on my left hand side. ‘In the course of my correction I hit the cyclist from behind causing him to come off and on to the near side of my bonnet. ‘I was braking the whole time so after the impact he was thrown forward as my vehicle decelerated. ‘The cyclist was thrown forward and came to a stop by a tree. ‘It felt like the blink of an eye. It happened that quickly from impact to stepping out of the vehicle.’ Defence counsel Ben Summers had said it was important to balance Lynch’s ‘momentary lapse’ against the ‘much longer lasting, perhaps permanent consequences for Mr Belmonte’ He said: ‘It is difficult [to pass sentence] in the particular circumstances of this case because this is a case in which there was no decision, for reasons of bravado, thrill-seeking or aggression, to drive in a way that was at least potentially dangerous, this was an officer responding in the course of his duty to an emergency call.’ Reading from Lynch’s letter of resignation he said: ‘Given the media coverage of my case I would not wish to cause the BTP any further embarrassment, but, more than that, I feel I can no longer carry out the roles and responsibilities associated with my position. ‘I feel morally obliged to give up the role which I’ve cherished for the last five years.’ Earlier this year singer-songwriter Mr. Belmonte, also known as Pepe, said: I miss my life as it was before the accident. I was young. and living the life of a working musician cycling round London looking. for venues to play and musicians to play with.' Speaking after the officer’s trial in August, the musician’s mother Patsy Belmonte, from Weybridge, Surrey, said: ‘Pepe was just a week away from launching his first album when he was hit. ‘He has since spent 15 months recovering. It has had a huge impact on every area of his life, including his career and his independence. ‘Physically, he will never be the same.’ Highlights:","completion":"- A police officer named David Lynch caused severe injuries to a cyclist, Joseph Belmonte, while responding to an emergency call in east London.

Sentence 1: She said members could have a quick caucus during the period set aside for closing statements at the end of the debate to decide what the gaffe had been. Sentence 2: The congress members were undecided about the gaffe. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, the second sentence could be true, depending on the context and timing of the events. There is a relationship between the two sentences, as they both concern the members' opinions or decisions about a gaffe that occurred during a debate. In Sentence 1, the speaker states that the members could have a quick caucus (short meeting) to decide what the gaffe (mistake or blunder) had been during the period set aside for closing statements at the end of the debate. This implies that the gaffe may have been identified, but the members need to have a discussion to come to a consensus about it. In Sentence 2, it states that the congress members were undecided about the gaffe. This means that they still have not made a decision or reached a consensus regarding the gaffe, and it's unclear what the specific mistake or blunder was. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence could also be true, especially if it takes place before the mentioned \\"quick caucus\\" in which the members will discuss and decide on the nature of the gaffe. This would suggest that the members have yet to have the caucus mentioned in Sentence 1, and therefore, they are still undecided. However, if the second sentence takes place after the caucus mentioned in Sentence 1, there could be two possible situations: 1. If the caucus led to a unanimous decision about the gaffe, then Sentence 2 would not be true, as the congress members would no longer be undecided. 2. If during the caucus, the congress members could not reach a consensus and were still unsure about the gaffe, then Sentence 2 would still be true. In conclusion, the truthfulness of the second sentence depends on the timing and context of the events described in both sentences. If Sentence 2 takes place before the caucus in Sentence 1 or if the caucus failed to result in a decision on the gaffe, then Sentence 2 can be true. If the caucus led to a unanimous decision, then Sentence 2 would be false."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer. Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... and the situation: Bobby and Sally are siblings that currently live in different cities. Bobby lives in a city that has wildfires on a regular basis.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Possible answers: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no; And the answer is:","completion":"1). yes; The hypothesis is entailed by the premise because the premise states that similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals, which implies that they have appeared in previous inaugurals as well. This means that there is a recurring pattern of similar diagnoses and prescriptions in subsequent inaugural addresses. The hypothesis directly relates to this notion of similarity by indicating that the diagnoses and prescriptions in question are similar to ones in previous inaugurals. To further understand the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, one can look at the terms diagnoses and prescriptions, which typically refer to the identification of a problem or issue and the recommended solution or approach for solving the problem, respectively. In the context of inaugural addresses, this could mean identifying issues that previous administrations faced or acknowledging ongoing challenges that will continue to be relevant during the new administration. In addition, prescriptions in this context would refer to the policy proposals or suggestions for resolving these problems. The fact that the premise outlines that these diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals suggests that they are closely related to or based on ones in previous inaugurals. This implies that newly-elected leaders might acknowledge the work done by their predecessors or propose modifications to existing policies to align their initiatives more closely with the current administration's vision. The hypothesis essentially restates the premise's notion of similarity between the inaugural addresses' content. According to both the premise and the hypothesis, these similarities exist as diagnoses and prescriptions in the context of political issues and policy proposals. This logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis supports the conclusion that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. FCC moves to open television set-top box for Internet, competition The Federal Communications Commission took a tiny step forward on Wednesday toward updating the television set-top box, a move that Chairman Julius Genachowski hopes will eventually stir more competition between providers of paid television and Internet services. âConsumers want devices that can navigate the universe of video programming from all of these sources and present the choices to them in a simple, integrated way,â Genachowski said in the commissionâs meeting Wednesday. âThey also want to know that they can buy a device and not have to replace it if they change video providers.â The FCC voted Wednesday to begin studying ways to achieve that goal, which was part of the agency's national broadband plan. One proposal would require paid television service providers to deliver their signals to a small adapter that could serve as a standard interface for broadband and paid television content. That adapter would connect to a television, computer or other device. Motorola and Cisco make the vast majority of set-top boxes currently on the market. Cable and satellite providers control those devices by renting them to consumers. Mandating a standardized gateway device would allow consumers to switch pay TV providers without getting a new set top box. And it would permit integrated television service and Internet service on a TV set. âWe think the FCC wants to lay the groundwork for over-the-top video to potentially impose some competitive pressure on pay TV providers in the future,â said analyst Paul Gallant of the Concept Capital research firm. That policy could help Internet TV providers like Netflex, Apple, Google and Amazon, he said. But the proposal is sure to be met with resistance. âCable/telecos/satellite providers are capable of bringing a fair amount of political opposition to the table if they decide this is sufficiently problematic for their pay TV business,â Gallant said. During Wednesday's FCC meeting, Republican member Robert McDowell cautioned against rules that could hamper progress already seen in the market. âThe idea of accessing the Internet through the TV screen is certainly attractive â so attractive, in fact, that the marketplace already appears to be delivering on that vision without any help from the government,â McDowell said. âA quick Internet search revealed more than a dozen different devices available to consumers who wish to bring some or all of the Internet to their television screens, ranging from specialized web video products and software applications to elaborate home theater PCs and even online gaming consoles.â By Cecilia Kang | April 22, 2010; 8:00 AM ET Categories: Broadband , FCC Save & Share: Previous: FCC begins reform of USF fund, doesn't address reclassification Next: FCC's Clyburn skirts reclassification, likely to side with chairman Set TOP Box is Terminal, thats strong point.

I recently built a DVR out of a home computer to allow me to integrate Internet video and cable programming in one unit. Literally 2 months after I set this unit up, Comcast began to digitize and scramble TV signals to lock you into using only 'their' box. Cable companies are a monopoly already, so at least open up the set-top business to some competition.

Unless the box is opened all the way up, to accommodate a la carte pricing, there's no need to change it. Posted by: mattintx | April 22, 2010 1:43 PM | Report abuse I am again doubtful that the FCC has the authority it is attempting to wield. As is true in regard to network neutrality, Congress has not granted authority to the FCC to mandate the creation of devices that deliver content to consumers within specifications it sets. And, I must come to the defense of Comcast in this instance. With Xfinity online, it offers the most Internet content for viewing without additional charges to subscribers of any provider. Coupled with Apple TV for channels I don't subscribe to, I've found this to be pretty adequate.

Posted by: leuchars | April 22, 2010 6:46 PM | Report abuse The rationale the courts used recently for striking down the FCC's attempt to regulate Comcast was that consumers have choices. I predict that this will show how little choice the cable companies are giving their customers, as they bring out their lobbying guns (for which their customers pay).

It will be GREAT if we can just go down to Best Buy and choose our set top box/DVR and pay the 200 or so it will cost retail (for a high-end box -- cheaper ones without bells and whistles like PnP will probably go for around 80, and non-DVRs will probably be around 30), rather than paying Verizon over 20/mo. for a DVR with less capacity and capabilities and that is limited to their offerings alone. Posted by: FergusonFoont | April 23, 2010 8:56 AM | Report abuse I think it is an outrage that we now have to have all these set top boxes. Has anyone ever picked up their set top box lately its like a small heater it gives off so much heat.

Netflix content canbe accessed by computers, Xbox360, Playstation 3, and now the Nintendo WII. The Netflix model offers everything including individual authentication of the subscriber. Posted by: Jon7 | April 23, 2010 1:15 PM | Report abuse How would this really work? Cable, OTA and DBS all use different modulation schemes, but building an STB that supports all of these isn't that difficult. And the current compression schemes used by cable and DBS are MPEG2 and MPEG4/AVC/H.264, all readily supported by the same chipsets. But mandating that a cable, DBS or Internet-based video service conform to a particular STB box standard would really hamper future innovation. For example, OTA broadcast has to use 8VSB modulation which makes it unworkable for mobile reception (unlike COFDM), and also uses MPEG2 compression which is no where near as efficient as the newer MPEG4/AVC/H.264 schemes. But your local TV station can't upgrade to these newer technologies or what's yet to come, because they have to maintain backwards compatibilty with a standard decided in the 1990s. By forcing STBs to a particular standard - and similarly making cable and DBS providers maintain compatibility with this standard, we'd be similarily locking them into technology that will become obsolete. With ever increasing bandwidth, we might see the day when viewers use the superior compression provided by JPEG2000 vs. MPEG (digital cinema already uses this compression scheme), but not if we lock our STBs down today. More than modulation and compression, the menus and guides (middleware) are where we'll see some of the most important innovations. Will it be possible to design a STB standard that will still support the next innovations in middleware? That would be like making a PC in 2002 that could run the iPad OS today - unlikely. And if the iPad ran Windows ME would anybody really buy one? The better option is to guarantee competition. I have only one choice for high speed Internet - Comcast. And while I am very pleased with their service (it's far better than Verizon has ever been, and I was estatic the day I finally ditched my analog phone service), the lack of choice is the real issue, not the cost of the terminals. For example, Sirius only became worse after merging with XM (didn't the FCC once require that they have interoperable receiving systems?); their compression is so agressive now that I can't listen to the music channels anymore. If the FCC really wants to help then they'll insure choice instead of mandating technical obsolescence. But I'll bet they'll let Comcast buy NBC instead, as if that somehow will make any of us see improved television programming and choice.

The reviewer has expressed several unfavorable opinions about the product, which I will explain in further detail below. 1. Unclear Branding: The reviewer mentions not being sure about the brand of the product due to its plain packaging with no label or instructions. This implies that the reviewer is not confident about the product's identity, which is not a positive sign for the manufacturer or reseller. 2. Weak Binding: The primary issue presented in the review is the weak binding property of the product. The reviewer states that the binding failed to hold, which directly impacts the product's performance and user satisfaction. This, in turn, contributes to the negative tone of the review. 3. Wasted Product: The reviewer's dissatisfaction is further emphasized by the mention of wasting over half of the box due to the binding's poor performance. The wasted product indicates that the reviewer was unable to achieve the desired results, contributing to their negative experience. 4. Comparing with Competitor's Product: The reviewer also mentions purchasing a similar product from the Fellowes brand, which worked better for them. By comparing the two products, the reviewer highlights the inferior quality of the product in question, implying that the latter is not on par with its competitors.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Mrs. De Winter convinces Maxim to hold a what? as he did with Rebecca costume party A:","completion":"Title: \\"Unveiling the Secrets: A Masquerade of Truth\\" Plot: Act 1 - A Mysterious Past Mrs. De Winter (Olivia), recently married to the wealthy and enigmatic widower Maxim De Winter, grows curious about her husband's past and his previous wife, Rebecca, who passed away under mysterious circumstances. Olivia discovers that Maxim used to throw extravagant costume parties in the past that were orchestrated by Rebecca, but he has been avoiding any celebrations or festivities since her death. Curiosity soon turns into an obsession for Olivia, as she feels herself living in the shadow of the late Rebecca, whose memory haunts the occupants of the De Winter estate, Manderley. In an attempt to get closer to her husband and the truth about Rebecca, Olivia convinces Maxim to hold a costume party, just as he did with Rebecca. Act 2 - The Party Unfolds As preparations for the grand costume party are made, Olivia comes across a mysterious locked room in the mansion filled with Rebecca's belongings and secrets. She finds a carefully preserved photo album, containing pictures of past costume parties, and a cryptic unsigned letter. With each new clue, Olivia becomes more determined to connect with Maxim and unravel the truth. The masquerade finally takes place, with everyone in attendance dressed in their most extravagant outfits. Olivia surprises Maxim by dressing up as Rebecca, wearing the same costume that she wore in her last party. The surprise turns into shock, as memories of Rebecca's death begin to reveal themselves. Act 3 - Unraveling the Mystery As tensions rise at the party, the truth about Rebecca's death unravels. In a dramatic turn of events, Olivia confronts Maxim, who confesses that he never loved Rebecca, and it was Rebecca's manipulative nature that led to her tragic end. Throughout the years, he had been living under the shadow of guilt and fear, but now the truth needed to be revealed. Unbeknownst to them, the cryptic letter from the locked room turns out to be a suicide note written by Rebecca, which provides evidence of her troubled and manipulative personality. With the truth finally out, the party becomes a turning point for the De Winter couple, rebuilding their trust and allowing them to move on from the past. As they step out of the dark shadow of Rebecca, Maxim and Olivia find love and hope as they embark on a new chapter in their lives together."},{"prompt":"Kendall understood and appreciated Cameron's inferences as Cameron talked to the crowd.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Imran Khan Niazi PP, HI (Urdu: \`mrn Hmd khn nyzy) (born 5 October 1952) is a Pakistani politician, former first-class cricketer and philanthropist who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and serves as a member of the National Assembly. Prior to entering politics, Khan played international cricket for two decades in the late twentieth century. Khan was born to a Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952 and educated at Aitchison, Worcester, and later at Keble College, Oxford. At the height of his career, in 1982, the thirty-year-old Khan took over the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team from Javed Miandad. As a captain, Khan played 48 Test matches, out of which 14 were won by Pakistan, 8 lost and the rest of 26 were drawn. He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie. In the team's second match, Khan led them to their first Test win on English soil for 28 years at Lord's. Khan's first year as captain was the peak of his legacy as a fast bowler as well as an all-rounder. He recorded the best Test bowling of his career while taking 8 wickets for 58 runs against Sri Lanka at Lahore in 1981-1982. He also topped both the bowling and batting averages against England in three Test series in 1982, taking 21 wickets and averaging 56 with the bat. Later the same year, he put up a highly acknowledged performance in a home series against the formidable Indian team by taking 40 wickets in six Tests at an average of 13.95. By the end of this series in 1982-1983, Khan had taken 88 wickets in 13 Test matches over a period of one year as captain. This same Test series against India, however, also resulted in a stress fracture in his shin that kept him out of cricket for more than two years. An experimental treatment funded by the Pakistani government helped him recover by the end of 1984 and he made a successful comeback to international cricket in the latter part of the 1984-1985 season. In India in 1987, Khan led Pakistan in its first-ever Test series win and this was followed by Pakistan's first series victory in England during the same year. During the 1980s, his team also recorded three creditable draws against the West Indies. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 World Cup, but neither ventured beyond the semi-finals. Khan retired from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. In 1988, he was asked to return to the captaincy by the president of Pakistan, General Zia-Ul-Haq, and on 18 January, he announced his decision to rejoin the team. Soon after returning to the captaincy, Khan led Pakistan to another winning tour in the West Indies, which he has recounted as \\"the last time I really bowled well\\". He was declared Man of the Series against West Indies in 1988 when he took 23 wickets in 3 Tests. Khan's career-high as a captain and cricketer came when he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Playing with a brittle batting line-up, Khan promoted himself as a batsman to play in the top order along with Javed Miandad, but his contribution as a bowler was minimal. At the age of 39, Khan took the winning last wicket himself.","completion":"This text is about Imran Khan Niazi, a Pakistani politician, former first-class cricketer, and philanthropist.

A. lake B. playground C. pond D. aquarium E. stucco The best answer is A:","completion":"To determine the best answer for where you could find a pebble that has been walked on, let's evaluate each option step by step. A. Lake A lake typically has a shoreline with an assortment of rocks and pebbles. People often walk along the shore, so there is a high probability of finding pebbles that have been walked on. B. Playground Playgrounds generally have either sand, wood chips, or rubber surface materials for safety reasons. Pebbles are not common in playgrounds, and therefore finding a walked-on pebble could be rare here. C. Pond Similar to lakes, ponds also have shorelines with rocks and pebbles. People often walk near and around ponds, increasing the chances of finding a walked-on pebble. D. Aquarium Aquariums are indoor facilities that showcase aquatic animals and plants. Although there might be pebbles in various exhibits, people typically cannot access those areas, so finding a walked-on pebble in an aquarium is unlikely. E. Stucco Stucco is a type of plaster used as a wall finish and does not have any relation to pebbles. Therefore, chances of finding a walked-on pebble here are nonexistent.

Write an article based on this summary: – Amanda Knox has been freed and while the case may continue to be hotly debated in the Italian press, commentators in the US and Britain are overwhelmingly of the opinion that justice has been done. The Knox case, \\"was a textbook example of our never-ending fascination with the supposed femme fatale,\\" Nina Burleigh writes at the Los Angeles Times. Knox became a scapegoat and was subjected to \\"all manner of outlandish, misogynistic behavior\\" because of the focus on Knox herself—\\"her femaleness, her American-ness, her beauty\\"—instead of the facts. The prosecution's case was \\"always just too far-fetched\\" and the verdict confirms what many thought: \\"Knox certainly was guilty of goofy, insensitive behavior and pot use,\\" opines her hometown Seattle Times. \\"But there was never sufficient evidence to prove she murdered her roommate, whom she knew only a few weeks.\\" The Italian legal system painted Knox as \\"a siren who could apparently entice a virtual stranger to commit murder with her hypnotic sexual charms\\" when it should have accepted the truth: \\"The police had simply been wrong,\\" writes Harry Mount at the Telegraph. The ineffectiveness of the justice system in Italy—where \\"appointments are invariably made through nepotism rather than competence\\"—means rulings are rarely convincing, conspiracy theorists run rampant, and the line between fact and fiction is too often blurred, writes Tobias Jones at the Guardian. Silvio Berlusconi is desperate to reform the judiciary, he notes—but also desperate to avoid it. Article:","completion":"Title: The Amanda Knox Case: A Tale of Misogyny, Injustice, and the Need for Legal Reform Amanda Knox has been released, and while her case remains a subject of heated debate in Italy, the consensus amongst commentators in the United States and Britain is that justice has finally prevailed. The Knox case serves as a reminder of society's enduring fascination with the archetype of the femme fatale, as Nina Burleigh points out in the Los Angeles Times. Knox became a convenient scapegoat due to the focus on her personal attributes - her gender, her nationality, and her attractiveness - rather than the facts at hand. Subjected to a barrage of outlandish and misogynistic behavior, the prosecution's case against her was always tenuous at best. As Amanda's hometown Seattle Times remarks, Knox may have displayed \\"goofy, insensitive behavior and pot use,\\" but there was never sufficient evidence to prove that she was responsible for the murder of her roommate, whom she had known for only a few weeks. Ironically, the Italian legal system sought to depict Knox as a seductive siren, capable of enticing a virtual stranger to commit murder at her behest. Instead, as Harry Mount writes in the Telegraph, they should have acknowledged the glaring inconsistencies in the case and admitted that the police had erred in their investigation. Tobias Jones, writing for the Guardian, further highlights the ineffectiveness of the Italian justice system, a labyrinthine bureaucracy where appointments are often made based on nepotism rather than competence. This system breeds doubts about the legitimacy of rulings, fosters conspiracy theories, and blurs the distinction between fact and fiction. Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, has expressed his eagerness to enact judicial reform but has simultaneously tried to evade the legal consequences of his actions. The Amanda Knox case not only exposes the deep-rooted misogyny that continues to pervade society but also underscores the urgent need for legal reform in Italy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I recommend families if possible,to show this to older children only.Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle.Now that thats out of the way,let me explain about this movie.This is in reality a documentary of a male fox,who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate.The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score,is breath taking.You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible,it'll get ugly later.They gave both the fox and the vixen names,but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me.He fights off this invading male,to win her love.They later on create a den,and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind.There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family,but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon.The first victim is the blind pup,who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away.The second victim is the mother,who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole.She unknowingly walks into a foot trap.While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot,causing her to bleed to death.The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree.The male is now a single dad,forced to take on the roll of mom and dad.He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.It later proves not to be enough,when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man.I won't spoil the surprising ending for you,but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail.And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through.I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable.I was only 4 when I saw it,but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it.Now I know why,after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney,when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.I was moved to tears.But as dark and ugly as it was,it serves a purpose.To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals,and why they are endangered.This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species,and I hoped it worked.Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney,they don't teach about why animals are going extinct.The encroachment of land,the killing off of the foxes main prey,and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered.I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better.Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up.This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes,especially when one of the parents suddenly dies.The surviving parent takes on the roll of both,and tries to teach the important lessons of life.It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults,especially when some of their lives becomes ruined.Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard.

Sean Parnell tells an audience in Anchorage, Alaska, the amount of this year's Permanent Fund Dividend that will go to most residents just for living in the state, Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2014.... (Associated Press) This year's share of nearly 1,900 is the sweetest since the Great Recession and the third-richest ever. Gov. Sean Parnell announced the amount of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend with great fanfare Wednesday. \\"This is all good news for Alaskans,\\" he said at an Anchorage press conference. The payout to be distributed Oct. 2 is more than double the amount of last year's 900 checks but short of the record payout of 2,069 in 2008. — WHO QUALIFIES? The dividends are distributed annually to men, women and children who sign up for it after living in the state for at least one calendar year, or were born in Alaska by the Dec. 31 deadline of the previous year. This year, nearly 599,000 Alaskans will receive checks, either through direct deposit or in the mail. Of those, the oldest recipient is 109 years old and the youngest includes 26 children who were born Dec. 31. Altogether, the checks total 1.1 billion. — THE PAYOUT FORMULA: The amount of each person's check is based on a five-year average of the fund's investment earnings, which have included the recession years. Alaska wasn't hit as hard by the recession as the Lower 48, but the Permanent Fund Corp. has a diversified portfolio that was clobbered when markets plunged worldwide. The fund has since recovered, according to officials. The fund had a balance of 29.9 billion in 2009, compared to 51.2 billion five years later. — HOW DO FOLKS SPEND IT? Some dividend payouts go toward fun stuff like vacations and big-screen TVs. But in the remote village of Deering, city administrator Mike Jones says his family's share, 5,652 for the family of three, will go toward bills and heating fuel, which is 6.50 a gallon and rising. \\"There was a time when I was younger I would go for snow machines and fun stuff,\\" Jones said. These days, necessities take precedence for the family in the Inupiat Eskimo community 520 miles northwest of Anchorage. — RETAIL SALES: Businesses often rush to take advantage of the cash infusion, offering Permanent Fund Dividend deals. For example, the Girl Scouts of Alaska announced a 10 percent discount on all non-uniform apparel in a \\"PFD Super-Saver\\" sale being held through Friday at an Anchorage Girl Scouts store. Alaska Airlines announced more than 90 destinations available through a PFD sale running between Sept. 24 and Oct. 29. \\"How does travel to faraway warm sapphire seas sound? How about exciting cities you've always wanted to see?\\" the airline says on its website. \\"This is the flight sale that's made just for Alaskans.\\" — GIVING TO CHARITY: Some Alaskans choose to give part of their dividend to charitable causes through the \\"Pick. Click. Give.\\" program. This year, 26,850 recipients pledged 2.8 million to 511 nonprofit organizations. — HOW DID IT ALL BEGIN? The Permanent Fund was established in 1976 after the discovery of oil on Alaska's North Slope. The state began distributing fund money to residents in 1982. If an Alaskan has qualified for all of the checks distributed since the beginning, they would have collected 37,027.41. With the upcoming distribution, the state will have distributed more than 21.9 billion over the years. — DON'T FORGET THE IRS: Alas, it's not all free money. Alaska has no state income tax, but residents must pay federal taxes on the bounty. ___ Follow Rachel D'Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro ||||| Summary:","completion":"The people in Alaska will receive money from the state's oil wealth savings account. This year, they will get nearly 1,900 each, which is more than double the amount of last year's 900. The money comes from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, which gives money to those who have lived in Alaska for at least one year or were born there by the deadline. People use the money for different things, like buying fun stuff, paying bills, or giving to charity. The Permanent Fund started in 1976 after oil was found in Alaska."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Hmmm… that’s a hard one. At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family. Don’t be misled, we are not the Cleavers. We have “Fun Friday” where Mom does not get to badger them about their table manners (ugh - they revel in this), Sometimes we eat in the living room while we watch a movie, sometimes we eat in shifts because of our schedules. However, the majority of meals have been together ~ I feel like this is a gift we gave them. Who does not get to complain on \\"Fun Friday?\\" - not enough information - Dad - Mom - Twins A:","completion":"Establishing a routine of family dinners at the table can be highly rewarding for your family in numerous ways. Regardless of the type of meal served, whether it is a home-cooked meal or fast food, the primary focus should be on the time spent together as a family. Family dinners foster communication, strengthen family bonds, and create lasting memories. They form a stable and consistent platform for open conversations, teaching manners, discussing serious issues, and sharing laughter, stories, and dreams. As you mentioned, these dinners may not always be perfect, but they allow the family to grow and learn together. By discussing highs and lows of the day, each family member has the opportunity to express their feelings, learn about each other's experiences, and offer support when needed. This open line of communication is essential in building trust among family members while also promoting healthy self-expression. When children were little, engaging them in conversations using prompts like sharing one funny, sad, or new thing from their day can be an effective way to encourage them to open up and share their thoughts. As they grow older and become teenagers, the conversations may naturally evolve and become more in-depth. Having a variety of family dinner experiences, such as \\"Fun Friday\\" where table manners are relaxed or eating in the living room while watching a movie, can keep the experience enjoyable and prevent it from becoming monotonous. This flexibility also helps accommodate busy schedules that may require the family to eat in shifts or at different times. As children grow older and move on to new stages in life, the family table will undoubtedly experience changes. Despite these changes, the time spent together, the lessons learned, and the memories shared at the table will continue to have an impact on their lives and strengthen the family's bond. In conclusion, making family dinners at the table a priority, despite the inevitable challenges, is indeed a gift to your children. The values, connections, and memories fostered during these shared meals are invaluable and provide a strong foundation for their future relationships and personal growth. The sentimentality of the worn oak table represents years of shared experiences - both good and bad - that have ultimately shaped your family's dynamic and will continue to serve as a reminder of what truly matters in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Post Politics Hour Archive: Post Politics Hour discussion transcripts Paul Kane: Good morning, folks. Wow, the news on Capitol Hill is just, well, I don't know. Over the years now I've written about DOJ/FBI investigations into Torricelli, Stevens, Abramoff and his cronies, and sex scandals involving Larry Craig and now Ensign, and I think there are some others that I'm forgetting. Oh, Vitter. I'm beginning to think, You know, maybe it's not them; maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the cause of all this, the way the hatch's magnetic forces in LOST caused all those plane crashes, somehow I'm the guy who's got this magnetic force propelling these guys into acting so badly. Or maybe I'm just a reporting deviant and I like writing about these bad things. OK, enough navel gazing. On to your questions. And I promise to write about more than just the Ensign scandal and the rain-plagued U.S. Open. Des Peres, Mo.: Hey, Paul. How seriously do you take these most recent polls that suggest the public is either tiring or becoming suspicious of the President's many programs? More importantly, does Congress take those polls into account when they decide how much they should oppose a presidential initiative? Thanks. Paul Kane: OK, lots of Obama-poll questions. The Republicans love the new info, and the line of last night -- which a senior GOP aide emailed me at 7:45 last night after watching Hardball -- was \\"the honeymoon is over.\\" I'm not so sure that's the case, but let's face it, the American people are still scared. The slow-and-steady climb of the stock market this year has done little make voters feel secure -- given the fact that it's still down 40 percent or so from the 14,000-high of a couple years ago. And they see the huge deficits, the takeover of GM/Chrysler, and they worry about things. So this shows that Obama is taking ownership of these issues, now that he's been president for 6 months or so. The voters don't see this as a Bush-era problem. They aren't demanding immediate perfection, but slowly but surely they aren't buying this as a Bush-era problem. Rockville, Md.: How much longer do you think it will take for the late night hosts to kid about Obama the way they did about W and Bill? Paul Kane: Well, in terms of the late-night folks, just watch Stewart on Daily Show. Because he's the leading edge of all late-night comedy. His routine is more bawdy, and he'll do the curse thing in which they bleep out the F word or the P word, etc. But Stewart is without question a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, but he's got no beef turning on Democrats. (Ask Nancy Pelosi's staff about watching Stewart's commentaries over the CIA-briefing issue last month, known here in this chat affectionately as LollaPelosi.) Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.: What's your view on Sen. Durbin's statement that banks \\"own this place\\"? Paul Kane: Durbin is very, very frustrated by his inability to win enough support for his provision to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences. It's been a cause of his for a couple years now, and the banking industry has battled him at every turn, knocking him down each time he tries to get this passed. The industry has effectively labeled it \\"cram down\\", the derogatory term meaning judges could cram down interest rates and banks would have no say over things. This has infuriated Durbin, leading to him to charge that the banks are just so powerful, even in their current lousy condition, that they \\"own\\" Capitol Hill. As for his own investments, this was a very tricky move that Durbin pulled after getting his own briefing about the state of the economy last fall. Madison, Wis.: Mr. Kane, thanks for taking questions. I'm greedy so I'm going to ask two and you can decide which, if any, you want to answer: 1. What have you heard regarding the recent firing of Gerald Walpin, the Inspector General responsible for the Corporation for National and Community Service, the organization that runs AmeriCorps? Republicans are claiming this action was strictly political and intended to protect a contributor to the Obama campaign. 2. Why are Republicans now demanding a return of the Fairness Doctrine (in regards to the president's upcoming interview on healthcare on ABC News)? Paul Kane: I really don't know the answer to either question, but I picked your questions as a way to lecture those folks who want to be reporters. Never ask a politician a 2-part question. It's a failing of many, many reporters. Watch the next Obama live press conference and watch how many reporters naively ask 2-parters. The reality is that gives Obama/politicians options, so they choose to answer the question that they want to answer, talk forever on that question and then simply point into the audience of reporters and say \\"next question\\" without ever answering the question he/she didn't want to answer. Settle on your 1 question, firmly ask that and, if you get a chance, poke your way in for a follow up. That's my motto. I guess \\"what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas\\" doesn't help you if you happen to live in Las Vegas. I never saw Ensign as serious presidential candidate, but what do I know? Will this hurt his senate re-election chances? Paul Kane: I've always wanted to ask Ensign or Reid that question, whether the what-happens-in-Vegas motto applies to those that live there! By the way, a couple months ago, my buddies and I went to Vegas for a bachelor party, had a blast, but then we came home and the bachelor himself -- yes, the bachelor -- told his fiancÃ© everything that happened. It's ok, there were no laws broken, nothing really bad happened. He was on pretty good behavior, but what the heck? Doesn't that violate some federal law? Okay, as for Ensign, he falls into the Vitter level of scandal here. If nothing else comes out, if the whispers of demands for money don't turn into something bigger, if this is just a sex scandal, Ensign can easily hunker down and ride this out without any fear of having to resign. It happened right in the middle of his 6-year term, just like when Vitter got caught in the D.C. Madam web in 2007 -- both men had/have 3 years to rehab themselves before facing their home-state voters again. Boston: How is it that a couple of Senators from states that are as populous as small- to mid-sized cities get to control our country's health care debate? Of course as a civics geek I know why, but it is just galling. They have no opposition and they are just out there reaming their own party, their own president and 75 percent of the American populace. Paul Kane: Hahahaha. It is amazing, when you look at the Senate Finance Committee, how rural the composition of it is. It's amazing, Baucus from Montana, Grassley from Iowa. Jay Rockefeller from W. Va., Conrad from North Dakota, Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico. You gotta go to the 5th most senior Dem on the panel to find Boston's own John Kerry as a coastal liberal, and he's immediately followed by Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. On the GOP side of the aisle, Grassley is followed by Hatch of Utah, Snowe of Maine, Kyl of Arizona and then Bunning of Kentucky, Crapo of Idaho and Roberts of Kansas. Lots of middle earth in there. Los Angeles, Calif.: When asked the other day in a Post Q&A about Obama's mendaciousness with the LBGT community your Michael D. Shear said we'd \\"come around\\" eventually because \\"After all, where else do they have to go?\\" Do you share his cynically dismissive take? Paul Kane: I didn't read Shear's online chat so I can't assume what he meant, but I'd just say that some Democrats probably go take the gay vote for granted. Obviously they are not going to go vote for Republicans, the thinking goes, so you don't have to give in to all their demands. However, clearly they could decide to not cut checks and not cast their votes, and it would probably require some leading figures in that community, prominent out Hollywood figures, to take the first bold steps and launch the protest. That would be a real consequence to the Democratic inaction on this agenda. GOP outrage at ABC: Republicans are currently really angry that ABC TV is going to do a program on Obama and is not giving them equal time to share their own opinions. Do you think Republicans would support a law that requires broadcasters to give equal time to opposing viewpoints like the GOP's? A \\"Fairness Doctrine\\" of sorts? Paul Kane: Yeah, sorry to the question earlier that raised this point in the 2-parter that I kinda mocked. Sorry, this ABC thing I understand. Look, let's set aside the issue of \\"Fairness Doctrine\\" for the moment, and whether there should be a new law setting clear bright lines on this. But what ABC is doing, a daylong broadcast from the White House, simply would not be tolerated if this were the other way around. Imagine the scenario of, say, back in May 2003, after he rode shotgun onto the flight deck of the aircraft carrier and declared \\"Mission Accomplished\\", imagine if W came home to the White House and had Fox News do a 24-hour broadcast from the West Wing. Sorry, that would have been pummeled, mocked, humiliated, etc. I don't think ABC should be getting away with what they're doing now. Chicago, Ill.: Is it just me, or are some Republican pundits actually siding with Ahmedinejad? It occurs to me that if Mousavi prevails, then Obama may get a regime he can negotiate with, thus helping in establishing peace in the region. They (Republicans) would lose an another pillar of their foreign policy doctrine. Could this Iran election/Cairo speech be Obama's Reagan moment in Berlin (Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall)? Paul Kane: Sorry, I've been so deep into the weeds of both looking at lawmakers' financial disclosure forms and trying to root out conflicts of interest, and then following the Ensign scandal, that I'm just not completely up to speed on Iran. I've got a basic enough view of what's going on over there, but I can't really give an expert opinion on the matter. However, I'll say this much about the coverage of this whole Iranian \\"election\\" scandal. When did Iran become a democracy? The entire point of the Iraq invasion, I thought, once the WMDs were proved to be bunk, was to establish a beach-head of democracy in the Middle East -- the presumption being there was no democracy there. Why are we so outraged that there were election irregularities there in Iran? This wasn't Florida in 2000. Elizabeth Becton: Paul, please get people to stop calling me Liz! Paul Kane: No name calling I've been so hunkered down in this Ensign stuff that I haven't had the chance yet to fully engage in this e-mail shout fest. People, e-mail is a bad, bad thing. Think three times before you hit the send button: How would this look if it were posted on a gossip blog? Salinas, Calif.: Hi Paul. After reading Dana Milbank's account of Senate Republicans ducking comment regarding John Ensign's confession of adultery, (\\"Complicating the task was The Post's Paul Kane, who stood in the doorway between senators and their lunch.\\"), two questions came to mind: 1. Do you tend goal on Post hockey weekends? 2. After Craig and Vitter were able to weasel their way out of having to resign (John Edwards' career prospects, not so bright), will their constituents at home finally reach a threshold of disgust that leads them to \\"hate the sin, not the sinner\\", but throw the hypocrite out anyway? (Gay and lesbian couples in decades-long committed relationships must wonder what it's going to take to get past these conservative culture warriors.) washingtonpost.com: In the GOP Caucus, Prayers for the Sinner -- but Mostly Silence Paul Kane: Dana has written many of these Sketches before, he and I jokingly call them the \\"perp walk\\" sketch. Member of Congress -- Vitter, Stevens, Craig, Jefferson, etc. -- gets into some form of trouble, then returns to Congress and gets chased around by TV cameras and reporters. But this time, there was no perp to do the walk, since Ensign remains in his bunker in Vegas, baby, Vegas. So Dana pretty much told me and my friend Jessica Brady of Roll Call that he was going to sketch us asking the GOP what they thought of Ensign. Turned out kinda funny, I hope. As for me and goal-tender, no, never really did that. Except when I was kid growing up with 4 older brothers, there was some floor hockey played in our basement, in which it was 2-on-2, and sometimes they made me, the youngest, play goaltender. I'd take old couch cushions we had in the basement, tie them around my legs with my Dad's old ties, and pretend to be Bernie Parent. Guess it was good practice for blocking senators headed into lunch. Bethesda, Md.: \\"When did Iran become a democracy?\\" Well, it was until about 1953... Paul Kane: Thanks, thanks for both giving me the historical reference point -- and also making my point. If Bethesda is correct, we've had 56 years of non-democracy there. I\\"m not in any way suggesting what's happening there is good, or just, I'm just saying that from my completely non-expert eye, it looks like some of the media coverage is over heated. I lived in Beijing for a year, in 1994, and I'm well aware that they also have elections in China. And they are frauds, but I've never seen the media go crazy when these Chinese \\"elections\\" are held. ABC: Shouldn't we wait until after the airing of the program to criticize or mock it? We know what we would have gotten if Fox did a show about W, but do we know yet what we'll get from ABC? Paul Kane: Sorry, I just don't think I agree. If ABC goes in there and does a highly critical set of pieces on Obama, I'll be stunned. Was there a quid-pro-quo, Starling, involved here? No, definitely not. But the act of actually broadcasting from the seat of the government, to me, just appears to be so deep into the pocket of the Obama administration, that it's just not right. What if Harry Reid gave me a desk in his majority leader's office and I worked from his personal office? All the other reporters worked up on the 3rd floor of the Senate press gallery, except me, I worked downstairs on the 2nd floor in Reid's office, filed my stories from there. I don't think that would fly. And I don't think ABC should be broadcasting from the White House. Anonymous: Just wanted to say that piece on John Edwards was incredible. Excellent work! Paul Kane: Hope From a Humbler Perch There's Alec MacGillis's piece on Edwards. For some reason Edwards was eager to talk to Alec, so much so that Alec had to leave a farewell happy hour for one of our editors Friday night, at 9 o'clock, because Edwards was gonna call him for the story. I just can't get over the entire Edwards' family fall from grace. They once appeared to be the southern version of the Kennedys, the next generation of Camelot. Now, they're the Beverly Hillbillies. Washington, D.C.: What Springsteen song best encapsulates the Ensign scandal? Paul Kane: Brilliant Disguise, without a question. Read those lyrics, and read them from Darlene Ensign's perspective, think of her greeting the senator coming home late one night. For the times when Bruce sings 'woman', insert 'man'. Painful stuff: I heard somebody call your name I saw something tucked in shame Well I've tried so hard baby but I just can't see What a woman like you So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes or just a brilliant disguise Bad behavior of politicians: Does the bad behavior of politicians stem in part from their need for adulation -- why they may have gone into politics in the first place? And, conversely, does their power become the \\"aphrodisiac\\" that makes them attractive to these staffers that trip them up? Paul Kane: Ah, this is one of the oldest questions there is, is it the chicken or the egg? It's hard to tell, and I have to take a cop out here and suggest that it's both. In some cases these men are always in pursuit of adulation, and that leads them into these situations. David Maraniss, in his biographies of Bill Clinton, makes clear that he was always a womanizer, that it was part of his existence. John Edwards, on the other hand, has said that he wasn't that way until he got into politics and saw the adulation that others gave him, that it caused him to change, to morph into something he wasn't. We can argue about whether Edwards was telling the truth, but I think he definitely described an accurate portrayal of why some male politicians stray. How do we get Iran to go green and say no to nukes?: A single nuclear weapon can ruin your entire day? How do we stop Iran from becoming the Wal-Mart of nuclear weapons to terrorists on a budget? Paul Kane: If I knew the answer to this question, I wouldn't be sitting here chatting with you guys, I'd be down at Foggy Bottom telling Secretary Clinton what to say. Arlington, Va.: Good Morning Mr. Kane: Foley, Vitter, Craig and Ensign. Could these be the 4 Horsemen of the Republican Apocalypse? As the party's standing continues to erode in just released opinion surveys, might the shenanigans of some of its members diminish its chances in races for governor this fall and the mid-term 2010 elections? Paul Kane: A couple of you have pointed out Mark Foley. Wow, I forgot about him. But I'm sorry, folks, this is not just a Republican thing, Democratic male politicians are also dogs. Look at Clinton and Edwards and Gary Hart. The Republicans have a slightly more difficult problem because they often are social conservatives, espousing family values. Ensign went to Promise Keeper events, where the very existence of the group is meant to treat women better. Incidentally, I'm told Ensign headlined a Promise Keeper event with Randall Cunningham, No. 12 for the Philadelphia Eagles back in the '80s and '90s. Man, I loved the way that guy played QB, it was awesome. full-day for ABC? Thought it was an hour in prime-time...: Funny, Paul. I've only heard about ABC's plans to broadcast \\"a primetime hour from the White House devoted to exploring and probing the President's position and giving voice to questions and criticisms of that position.\\" What's this day-long thing you and Matt Drudge and the GOP are so incensed about? Paul Kane: Just so everyone's clear, the entire ABC news operation will be housed inside the White House. GMA, World News Tonight, and then prime time. Dunn Loring, Va.: Last year, when gas prices were steadily increasing, the Post and other media outlets had daily reports on the issue. Now, gas prices have risen 50 days in a row and yet there's no similar outcry. Other than a change in administration, is there any explanation for the difference in coverage? Paul Kane: Gas has risen from something like 2 a gallon, to 2.60, roughly. Last summer it topped 4. So, do the math. That's why the coverage hasn't been anywhere near the same. But trust me, once we get over 3 a gallon, you'll see more stories, and if it gets to 3.50, Obama will have a full-blown crisis on his hands. Hell's Kitchen, NYC: So the GOP objected en masse to increased funding to the IMF to help aid nations through the financial crisis, calling it \\"a global bailout.\\" How about the fact that this financial crisis was largely caused by the United States? Doesn't that trouble House conservatives at all? Paul Kane: The House Republicans have gone into a very old fashioned, protectionist, populist stance this year. I'm not sure if it's just a stance in opposition to Obama, or if this is a long-term refashioning of the GOP. It's a story to watch, and its origins begin with the first vote on the 700 billion bailout last September, the vote that failed when only 1/3 of House Republicans, 65 members, supported the bill. The markets tanked afterward, and many Republicans said, Fine. Paul Kane: OK gang, that's the hour, time for me to get moving. Questions were all over the map today, literally, from Iran to Vegas. Good thing I accidentally bought the venti coffee this morning. As always, I appreciate the time spent with everyone. And I'll see you back here in 2 weeks, on July 2, which coincidentally is the first day of Tiger Woods' PGA Tour event here in D.C.

Update: Portland Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the Water Bureau, says dumping 38 million gallons of water is the \\"conservative but correct\\" decision. Read more. Portland administrators will flush 38 million gallons of water from Mt. Tabor Reservoir 5 after a 19-year-old man urinated in the city’s drinking supply. “Even though there is very minimal public health risk, the bottom line is that our commitment is to serve water that’s clean, cold and constant,” said Water Bureau administrator David Shaff. “That doesn’t include pee. Not from people, at least.” The Portland Water Bureau has made public the video that prompted a security officer to call police Wednesday morning. Watch it here. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, the security officer who monitors video cameras at the reservoir complex spotted five people with skateboards “hanging out near the gatehouse,” Shaff said. Three of the men headed toward Reservoir 5, the kidney-shaped landmark on the western flank of Mt. Tabor. The camera caught one man as he stopped, leaned against the iron fence and, after a moment or two, hitched up his pants and pulled away from the bars, Shaff said. “When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars. There’s really no doubt what he’s doing,” Shaff said. “It’s stupid. You can see the sign that says: ‘This is your drinking water. Don’t spit, throw, toss anything in it.’ He’s four feet away from that sign. Unless he’s from North Dakota and just moved here, he’s got to know that’s our drinking water.” The video also shows two men trying to climb the fence. One made it and may have stepped in the water -- “If so, he discovered that it’s really, uncomfortably cold,” Shaff said. Then the men spent some time taking cell phone pictures of themselves. While the group was documenting its visit to the reservoir, a Water Bureau security officer and Portland Police officers headed in their direction. Police stopped a car on Southeast 69th Avenue near the east entrance to the park and cited three men on accusations of trespassing; one was also given a citation accusing him of public urination. Police have not released the names of those cited and have not decided whether to charge anyone with additional crimes. The Water Bureau used to keep security guards on duty at the Mt. Tabor and Washington Park reservoirs around the clock. But those posts were cut several years ago in an attempt to limit rate increases. Now the bureau has guards patrol all Water Bureau property, including the reservoirs, and officers who monitor reservoir security cameras from the city’s Emergency Operations Center in east Portland. Shaff said he does not believe having a security guard posted at Mt. Tabor would have sped the response Wednesday morning. Water Bureau officials turned off the pipes that carry water to and from Reservoir 5 immediately. They expect test results on the water to come back Thursday, and to show no contamination or health risk. Still, crews will flush the reservoir -- and give it a second spring cleaning on top of the one it received about a month ago -- over the next four to six days just to be safe and to reassure consumers. Strange things end up in Portland’s water supply all the time, with minimal risk or impact to users. And this is not the first time human beings have attempted to interfere with the stuff that comes out of Stumptown taps: In 2008, a man and a woman caught skinny dipping in Mt. Tabor were sentenced to 16 hours of community service each. Three years ago, the city flushed 8 million gallons of water after a 21-year-old Molalla man peed in Mt. Tabor Reservoir 1. City officials estimated that flushing the water and cleaning up after that episode cost 35,000. Shaff said he wasn’t sure what this effort will cost. The current shutdown at Mt. Tabor won’t impact Portland water users, he said. “Right now we’ve got 100-plus million gallons of day free flowing down the river because the Bull Run reservoirs are as full as they can be,” he said. “I’ve got tons of water available that doesn’t have human pee in it, so I’m going to replace this.” The federal government has ordered Portland and other cities with open-air reservoirs to cover them. City leaders are waiting on results of a May ballot measure that could shift control of the Water Bureau from the City Council to a new independently elected board to decide how to proceed. -- Anna Griffin ||||| The Mount Tabor number 1 reservoir in Portland, Ore., is seen in a June 20, 2011 photo.

(Associated Press) The Mount Tabor number 1 reservoir in Portland, Ore., is seen in a June 20, 2011 photo. Portland officials said Wednesday, April 16, 2014 that they are flushing away millions of gallons of treated water... (Associated Press) PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Portland officials are once again preparing to flush millions of gallons of treated water because someone urinated in a city reservoir. Water Bureau Administrator David Shaff said 38 million gallons will be discarded after a 19-year-old was videotaped in the act Wednesday. Three years ago, the city drained a 7.5-million-gallon reservoir at the same Mount Tabor location in southeast Portland. The open reservoirs hold water that's already been treated and goes directly into mains for distribution to customers. The urine poses little risk — animals routinely deposit waste without creating a public health crisis — but Shaff said he doesn't want to serve water that was deliberately tainted. \\"There is at least a perceived difference from my perspective,\\" Shaff said. \\"I could be wrong on that, but the reality is our customers don't anticipate drinking water that's been contaminated by some yahoo who decided to pee into a reservoir.\\" Water quality test samples have been taken from the reservoir, with results due Thursday. The water will be drained into the sewage system that eventually dumps into the Columbia River. In the meantime, Shaff said the city has plenty of water to meet demand. \\"It's easy to replace those 38 million gallons of water,\\" Shaff said. \\"We're not in the arid Southwest; we're not in drought-stricken parts of Texas or Oklahoma.\\" The incident occurred shortly after 1 a.m., when Water Bureau security personnel noticed three men on camera at Mount Tabor Reservoir No. 5. One was seen on video urinating through an iron fence, officials said. Minutes later, two other young men attempted to scale the fence. The three men, whose names have not been released, were cited for trespassing and excluded from Mount Tabor Park. A 19-year-old was cited for public urination. The kidney-shaped reservoir built in 1911 is drained for cleaning each spring and fall. The spring draining was done about three weeks ago, the Water Bureau said. The reservoir is one of five the city is in the process of replacing with underground storage to comply with federal regulations. Floy Jones, co-founder of the group Friends of the Reservoirs, criticized the decision to drain the reservoir, saying there's no evidence any urine reached the water and it wouldn't harm anyone if it did. \\"It's extremely wasteful,\\" she said. The man who urinated into Portland's water supply in June 2011 eventually pleaded guilty to misuse of a reservoir and was sentenced to community service. ___ Follow Steven DuBois at http://twitter.com/pdxdub . ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Portland officials are planning to flush 38 million gallons of water from Mt.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

UPDATED:. 10:46 EST, 20 November 2013. An ancient pocket of seawater has been discovered deep underground in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, and provides hints at what the world's oceans were like during the time of the dinoaurs. The sample is thought to be 100 to 150 million years old and suggests that the Atlantic was once twice as salty as it is now. The water contains chloride and bromide. as well as other chemicals which helped the scientists age it to the. Early Cretaceous Period. The water is thought to date back 150 million years, when the Acrocanthosaurus roamed Early Cretaceous North America (CGI of dinosaur, pictured) The Cretaceous Period refers to the state of the Earth 142 million to 65 million years ago. It ended with the greatest mass extinction in history - the entire planet's dinosaurs died out. It is thought that a giant asteroid impact caused the mass extinction. Prior to this, the Earth was warm with no ice caps at the poles. Much of what we now know as dry land -. such as southern England and the midwest of the USA was underwater,. since sea levels reached their highest ever during this time. The. Atlantic Ocean grew much wider as North and South America drew apart. from Europe and Africa. The Indian Ocean was formed at this time, and. the island that was India began its journey north towards Asia. While older water has been discovered in Canada, the Chesapeake Bay water that sits more than half a mile underground is now thought to be the oldest large body of water known on the planet. 'Previous evidence for temperature and salinity levels of geologic-era oceans around the globe have been estimated indirectly from various types of evidence in deep sediment cores,' said Ward Sanford, a United States Geological Survey research hydrologist and lead author of the investigation. 'In contrast, our study identifies ancient seawater that remains in place in its geologic setting, enabling us to provide a direct estimate of its age and salinity.' Scientists have described the finding as 'like a fly trapped in amber', which was trapped by the aid of a massive comet or meteorite impact that struck the area about 35 million years ago, creating Chesapeake Bay. The largest crater discovered in the U.S., the Chesapeake Bay impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide. The largest crater discovered in the U.S., the Chesapeake Bay impact crater is one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide. Scientists have described the finding as 'like a fly trapped in amber'. It is thought to have been trapped by the aid of impact of a massive meteorite (CGI pictured) About 35 million years ago a huge rock or chunk of ice traveling through space blasted a 56-mile-wide hole in the shallow ocean floor near what is now the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The force of the impact ejected enormous amounts of debris into the atmosphere and spawned a train of gigantic tsunamis that probably reached as far as the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 110 miles away. The impact of the comet or meteorite would have deformed and broken up the existing arrangement of aquifers - water bearing rocks - and confining units - layers of rock that restrict the flow of groundwater. Virginia's 'inland saltwater wedge' is a well-known phenomenon that is thought to be related to the impact crater. The outer rim of the crater appears to coincide with the boundary separating salty and fresh groundwater. 'We knew from previous observations that there is deep groundwater in quite a few areas in the Atlantic Coastal Plain around the Chesapeake Bay that have salinities higher than seawater,' said Jerad Bales, acting USGS Associate Director for Water. 'Various theories related to the crater impact have been developed to explain the origin of this high salinity. But, up to this point, no one thought that this was North Atlantic Ocean water that had essentially been in place for about 100 million years.' 'This study gives us confidence that we are working directly with seawater that dates far back in Earth’s history,' Bales continued. 'The study also has heightened our understanding of the geologic context of the Chesapeake Bay region as it relates to improving our understanding of hydrology in the region.' Groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of Canada may predate the emergence of multicellular life, but it certainly doesn't taste great, a leading scientist claimed earlier this year. A joint British and Canadian team discovered the ancient pockets of water, which they say are like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years. Barbara Sherwood Lollar, an Earth sciences professor at the University of Toronto, who was studying the water, described it as tasting 'terrible' after feeling compelled to take a sip. The water, that is still being studied, could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight. More exciting still, the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on Mars raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the Red Planet. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she said that what jumps out at you first is the saltiness. She said: 'Because of the reactions between the water and the rock, it is extremely salty. 'It is more viscous than tap water. It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup. It doesn't have colour when it comes out, but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy colour because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron.' She added that 'you would definitely not want to drink this stuff'.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect? The answer is:","completion":"Village A. The Allee effect refers to a phenomenon in biology where a species will have a lower individual fitness (such as reduced survival rate or reproductive success) when the population size or density falls below a certain threshold. This generally tends to take place in smaller, more isolated populations, leading to negative population growth and even extinction if the population size gets too small. From the provided information, it's stated that Village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically. These characteristics would make it much more likely to display an observable Allee effect due to its small, declining, and isolated population. On the other hand, Village A was described as displaying traces of a large population that grew larger over the years. With this growing and larger population, Village A does not exhibit the conditions that would typically lead to the Allee effect. Larger, thriving populations generally don't experience these types of negative growth dynamics associated with the Allee effect.

Joshua Gardner and Ap Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 10:13 EST, 9 December 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:13 EST, 9 December 2013. The Washington Redskins helped round out a humiliating year with a stomping from the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday that left stands nearly empty by halftime. Blizzardy conditions drove fans away last night in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but the faint dusting of snow at FedEx Field left the Skins with no excuse. And most all the footprints in what little snow did fall were on Robert Griffin III's side of the field, proving yet again the once-promising quarterback's team has lost its mojo. Barely snowed: Fans all but abandoned the Washington's FedEx Field on Sunday after the home team's brutal first half against the Kansas City Chiefs. It was the fifth straight loss for the Redskins, and it was enough to make even the toughest players lose faith. 'It's a terrible game to be a part of,' Redskins linebacker Brian Orakpo said. Griffin, too, was forced to be honest with himself and whatever Redskins fans who remain after the devastating season. 'None of us played good today,' Griffin said. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.' Nothing to play for: Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III walks off the field after the humiliating game, which his team lost 45-10. Griffin, who was the 2011 Heisman winner and number 2 draft pick of 2012, was replaced by backup Kirk Cousins in what became the team's fifth straight loss. 'None of us played good today,' Griffin admitted. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.' The Chiefs were already trouncing the Redskins 38-10 at halftime, when the stands all but cleared out despite the weather being far better than it was in snowy Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Sunday. In fact, fans deserted what was Washington's first snowy home game in decades, and those that stayed had plenty to boo. The Chiefs took the opening kickoff and gained 8, 9, 22 and 13 yards on their first four plays. The Redskins were a team with nothing to play for, and they looked like it. Shanahan eventually pulled the plug on Griffin, inserting Cousins for the final quarter. Meanwhile, everywhere else: Fans in Baltimore stuck to their seats despite far snowier conditions than in nearby Washington, DC during this game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. Far snowier: Eagles fans in Philly seemed to stick around, too, as major snow crept up the East Coast on Sunday while they hosted the Detroit Lions. Pittsburgh: The Steelers game against the Miami Dolphins in Pittsburgh also got more snow, and stirred more excitement, than the Redskins trouncing. It was perhaps the least interesting among all the East Coast games affected as the powerful, wintry storm that chilled much of North America through the previous week. Griffin, the 2011 Heisman trophy winner, has had a terrible year following his horrifying fall during January's losing game to the Seattle Seahawks, which knocked the Redskins out fo playoff contention. Since the injury, the final among several that unltimately left RGIII with two torn knee ligaments, the number 2 draft pick of 2012 has only fallen further. Bad year: RGIII has seen nothing but drama since this cringe-inducing fall in January ended what could have been a triumphant 2012 season for Griffin. Marital woes? What could have been a good day, the day RGIII was married in July, ended up being terrible for the quarterback after a Hooters waitress exposes purported proof he sent her racy messages on his wedding day. Speculation swirled immediately following his cringe-inducing fall around Coach Mike Shanahan's decision to play the already visibly weakened RBIII him in the first place. Even the day of his nuptials to Rebecca Liddicoat in July only remained a happy one briefly. Rumors soon spread online, along with purported visual proof, that RGIII had been sending racy messages to a Virginia Hooters waitress on the very day of his wedding. Griffin has also enured weeks of. questions about his relationship with Shanahan, who is rumored to take. issue with Griffin's relationship with the team owner Dan Snyder. Shanahan appears the odd man out in the triangle of coach, owner and franchise player. While. Shanahan has failed to even deny rumors he planned to quit last season,. the Washington Post reports that Griffin was recently overcome with. emotion as he discussed the off-the-field speculation and chatter. 'I’m. getting frustrated now, and trying to hold everything back,' Griffin. said as his eyes watered. 'Some things are allowed to happen, and we can. cut a lot of this stuff out, and it is not being cut out. I don’t know. what else I can do about that.' Deepening rifts? Griffin (right) has also been forced to fend off continued rumors about his embattled relationship with head coach Mike Shanahan (left, leaving after Sunday's losing game)","completion":"1.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ed spans a range of Brown's interests, from political skepticism to scatological humour to vampires and werewolves. The story is dark and surreal, desperate and humorous. Christian elements especially--largely sacriligeous--are prominent in the book. They are at first innocuous and unimportant: a zombie named Christian, another character who believes he has found Christ's face on a piece of adhesive tape. With the fourth issue of Yummy Fur, Brown's surreal take on Christianity becomes central: the cover depicts the Virgin Mary holding not just the infant Christ, but also a severed hand. Within is the story of Saint Justin, whose amputation becomes a key motif: Chet loses his own hand and finds another; his own appears mysteriously under Ed's pillow. Only by praying for forgiveness for his adultery and by murdering his lover is Chet's hand miraculously restored. According to the Lives of the Saints, the fictional Saint Justin severed his own hand, but in another version Brown presents, Justin's wife cuts it off with a woodaxe when she catches her husband masturbating after rejecting her advances. Despite Saint Justin's story's exposure to the reader as a fraud, Chet's faith in the official version restores his severed hand. The altered ending from 1992 has both Josie and Chet reunited in Hell, and the ghost of Chet's sister becomes a devil. As Brown mixes surreal sacrilege with the sort of moralism that compels him to condemn Josie for her bloody revenge, Brian Evenson calls Brown \\"deft at muddying the waters in a way that makes it very hard to pin him down as either belieever or satirist, as either anti-religionist or apologist\\". While not part of the Ed story, Brown had been serializing straight adaptations in Yummy Fur of the Gospels of Mark and of Matthew during most of Ed's run. R. Fiore called these adaptations \\"the best exploration of Christian mythology since Justin Green's Binky Brown\\", comparing Chet's excessive Christian guilt with the \\"almost childlike retelling\\" of Mark. Yummy Fur readers also found \\"I Live in the Bottomless Pit\\", a short strip in which a man discovers the Antichrist, who after millennia underground has forgotten his mission--a paradoxical one, as he states his orders were from God. Ed prominently features transgressive content including nudity, graphic violence, racist imagery, blasphemy, and profanity. Brown grew up in a strictly Baptist household in which he was not allowed to swear, as depicted in Brown's graphic novel I Never Liked You (1994). Brown challenged his own anxieties by tackling subjects such as scatological humour. Imagery such as the recurring Pygmy characters and their \\"ooga booga\\" language, Chris Lanier asserted, reinforce \\"old colonial imaging of 'third world natives' \\".

Please answer a question about the following article about Incandescent light bulb: A very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this water cycle. The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.

According to scientists, \\"scratch marks\\" or linear gullies on the Martian plains of Hellas Planitia were caused not by life forms but by dry ice—in fact, levitating dry ice. It's not magic: During Mars' winter, carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere turns solid and is imbedded in the red planet's soil. During summer, the reverse process takes place. The deposits break apart and slide over dune slopes, levitating in the process as the dry ice in contact with the warm sediment turns back to gas, per a release. This results in the gullies, which were spotted by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in a 1,400-mile-wide crater deeper than the Grand Canyon, reports CNET. To figure this out, scientists from Trinity College Dublin put a Martian-like soil sample under low pressures and temperatures in the lab to mimic Mars' atmospheric conditions, then added water, they explain Scientific Reports. The water immediately evaporated and, for a few seconds, caused soil it had contacted to levitate, reports New Scientist. On Mars, where gravity is weaker, researchers believe the effect could last for up to a minute, plenty of time for an ice block to \\"levitate and maneuver downslope, in a similar manner to how pucks glide on an ice-hockey table, carving a channel in its wake,\\" says study author Lauren McKeown. The block eventually disappears \\"without a trace other than the roughly circular depression beneath it.\\" (Mars also has what looks to be a bullet hole.)

Answer a question about this article: The Díaz administration made political decisions and took legal measures that allowed the elite throughout Mexico to concentrate the nation's wealth by favoring monopolies. During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative for the construction of the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cites of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the telecommunication network in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China.

An old lady who witnesses the thug says nothing to the police, but points out the thug to Nick and his group the next day. Nick and his friends forcibly grab the thug off the streets and place him in their van and drive away. The thug is later found dead in a vacant lot with all of his arms and legs broken and his head bashed in. One evening, Eddie returns home from work only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed, and Scott has been shot dead in a home invasion which was in retaliation for Vicki aiding a gas station attendant who was being assaulted earlier. Frederico \\"Rico\\" Melendez (Willie ColÃ³n), the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang, is arrested for the crime. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher (Carol Lynley) seeks a lengthy jail sentence, since New York does not have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick's lack of faith in the system is proven correct when Rico is set free after his right-hand man, Prago (Don Blakely), bribes both Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) and Eisenburg (Joe Spinell), Rico's attorney.

Question: \\"What is the longest time span of bird pairings?\\" Context: \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The longest time span of bird pairings can last for several years or until the death of one mate. This occurs in socially monogamous species, which make up ninety-five percent of bird species. These long-lasting pairings allow for both paternal care and biparental care, which is crucial for successful brood-rearing in some species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

The response \\"Dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness, bewitchingly beautiful, ethereal beauty, possibly deceptive\\" correctly answers the question \\"How is Madame White Snake characterized?\\" based on the given paragraph. The paragraph discusses how Madame White Snake is depicted as an attractive, enchanting, and potentially deceptive woman in both incarnations mentioned. It also associates negative connotations with her beauty and sexuality, which cause distractions for her lovers. Furthermore, the relation with the femme fatale archetype and the concept of fractured characterization adds to the complexity of her portrayal.

Consult your healthcare professional: Before making any decisions, it is crucial to speak with your psychiatrist or healthcare provider to discuss why you feel the need to stop taking your medication. They can assess your situation and determine the risks involved. Your healthcare professional will be able to provide you with advice on how to proceed. 2. Be open to their guidance: Your healthcare provider will carefully evaluate your reasons for wanting to stop, along with your medical history and current condition.

It's essential to remain patient and consistent in following your tapering plan and addressing any challenges along the way. 10. Follow up with your healthcare provider regularly: After you have stopped taking your mood stabilizers, continue to communicate with your healthcare professional about your well-being.

He outfits them with color-coordinated smartphones and treats them to luxurious accommodations â teaching them, as Roxy (Jasmine Guy) puts it later, that \\"nothing we do here matters\\".

I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this. I don’t think we are, but that’s the message we’re sending if we don’t force our government to do something.

In addition, engaging in open, non-confrontational discussions with others can help raise awareness about the issue, and participating in peaceful protests or rallies can demonstrate to lawmakers that citizens are demanding change.

Here is a detailed and long answer regarding Finnish language translation and the process: Finnish, known as the \\"suomi\\" language, is a member of the Uralic language family and is predominantly spoken in Finland. Translation from one language to another, especially when dealing with different language families, can be quite challenging. This particular task requires an understanding of both the English and Finnish languages, including the grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and semantics. The sentence provided: \\"Very well, Mr Falconer, I will pass on your opinion to the Bureau.\\" has been translated into Finnish as: \\"Hyvin, herra Falconer, välitän mielipiteenne virastolle.\\" Let's break down this translated sentence to understand the language rules and constructs: 1. \\"Very well\\" translates to \\"Hyvin\\" in Finnish. It is an adverb that matches the English word's meaning, and it is placed at the beginning of the sentence to express agreement or acknowledgement. 2. \\"Mr Falconer\\" remains unchanged in the translation. In Finnish, English titles such as \\"Mr\\" can be used, but the word \\"herra\\" is more appropriate, as it is the Finnish equivalent of the English title \\"Mr.\\" So, the translated name becomes \\"herra Falconer.\\" 3. \\"I will pass on\\" translates to \\"välitän\\" in Finnish. This verb matches the English meaning and is in its present tense, which is used in Finnish to express future actions that have not yet been completed. 4. \\"your opinion\\" translates to \\"mielipiteenne\\" in Finnish. The suffix -nne is added to \\"mielipide\\" (opinion) to express possession, turning it into \\"your opinion.\\" 5. \\"to the Bureau\\" translates to \\"virastolle\\" in Finnish. The word \\"virasto\\" means \\"bureau\\" or \\"office\\" in English. The suffix -lle is added to \\"virasto\\" to convert it into a directional form, indicating the intended recipient of the action. Following these language rules and structures, the translation \\"Hyvin, herra Falconer, välitän mielipiteenne virastolle.\\" accurately conveys the original English sentence. However, please note that for any translation, obtaining help from a native Finnish speaker or a professional translator will help ensure accurate translations and a deeper understanding of the language and its nuances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The kit is small, about 7-8 small stamps, one stamp pad with both pink & purple ink, and some colored pencils. But she had a lot of fun making sweet cards for everyone. She loves her arts & crafts, but I would guess for someone who already has a large array of stamps, this set might be a little to basic. But for a young girl who loves to make cards and crafts of sorts, this is a great beginner set. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?

Article:","completion":"Title: Pom Wonderful Accuses Coke Brand of Deceptive Labeling: How Laws Complement Each Other In Regulating Misleading Labels Introduction A recent legal conflict between the prominent beverage companies Pom Wonderful and Coca-Cola has drawn attention to the issue of deceptive labeling in the food and beverage industry. Pom Wonderful has accused a Coke brand of misleading consumers by using deceptive labeling on their products. The clash between these two beverage giants brings into focus the intricacies and relationships between different laws designed to regulate food and drink labels. Moreover, it highlights the importance of clear legal frameworks in protecting consumers from misleading marketing practices. Pom Wonderful's Accusations Pom Wonderful, a well-known American beverage company renowned for their pomegranate-based products, has recently taken a stand against Coca-Cola, one of the most recognizable global beverage brands. Pom Wonderful accused a Coke brand of engaging in deceptive labeling practices that misled consumers into believing they were purchasing a product different from what they were actually getting. This allegation magnifies the complexities of labeling laws for food and beverage products, specifically whether or not a labeling law may clash with private parties' efforts to sue under another separate law. Complementary Laws Critically, the court analyzing the case between Pom Wonderful and Coca-Cola determined that the labeling laws in question did indeed \\"complement each other\\" in their pursuit of regulating misleading food and drink labels. This ruling essentially upheld the legal rights of private parties, such as Pom Wonderful, to file lawsuits against parties that they believe have breached labeling regulations. This decision underlines the important harmony between different laws related to food and drink labeling regulations. The court's interpretation emphasizes that these legal frameworks are designed to function in a cooperative manner, without clashing or undermining one another. This allows for a more comprehensive and effective approach to ensuring that manufacturers and marketers follow appropriate guidelines and communicate honest, transparent information to consumers. The Importance of Regulating Misleading Labels The case between Pom Wonderful and Coca-Cola highlights the significance of strong legal frameworks for regulating misleading labels in the food and beverage industry. Deceptive labeling practices can negatively impact consumers - who may be misled into purchasing products based on false or exaggerated claims - and honest businesses, which could face unfair competition from brands engaging in fraudulent marketing strategies. By allowing private parties to pursue litigation against deceptive labeling practices, the court reinforces the necessity of a vigilant legal system that defends consumers' rights and supports fair business competition. It sends a clear message to manufacturers and marketers that engaging in unethical practices, such as deceptive labeling, will not go unnoticed or unpunished. Conclusion The legal battle between Pom Wonderful and Coca-Cola serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of comprehensive, cooperative legal frameworks that regulate food and drink labels. By establishing these laws that complement each other, courts can more effectively strike down misleading marketing and deceptive labeling practices that negatively affect both consumers and businesses. In fostering such a legal environment, society ensures the fair competition and protection of consumer interests, encouraging greater transparency across industries and leading to healthier choices in the marketplace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mewtwo (Japanese: miyuutsu, Hepburn: Myutsu, or ) is a fictional creature from Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokemon media franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, it first appeared in the video games Pokemon Red and Blue and their sequels, and later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles, as well as animation adaptations of the franchise. Masachika Ichimura voiced the franchise's original Mewtwo character in Japanese, and the creature's younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo's Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation. In English, Jay Goede voiced Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back and the Pokemon Live! musical. Japanese video game designer Ken Sugimori designed Mewtwo for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games, Red and Green, known outside Japan as Pokemon Red and Blue. Its name, which means the \\"second of Mew\\", derives from its existence as a genetic duplicate of the original Mew. Until the first Pokemon movie was released in the United States, Mewtwo was rarely referred to as a \\"clone\\" in Japanese sources. Kubo Masakazu, executive producer of Mewtwo Strikes Back, explained that they \\"intentionally avoid using the term 'kuron' [clone]... because the word has a frightening feel\\". Despite being Mew's descendant, Mewtwo directly precedes Mew in the game's numerical Pokemon index owing to the latter's secret inclusion by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto. During an interview, Pokemon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara stated that Mewtwo was expected to be popular with North American audiences, citing their preference for strong, powerful characters. Despite being Mew's clone, Mewtwo's appearance is very different in comparison. It appears as a bipedal feline that is 6 feet 7 inches (201 cm) tall and has a white body with a pronounced purple tail and stomach, purple pupils, bulbous fingertips, feline head, and a mass of flesh that connects from the center of its back to its head behind its neck. Its appearance has been likened to \\"an oversized cross of cat, squirrel and kangaroo\\". In the original games, Mewtwo is intended to be \\"the strongest Pokemon ever\\". As a result of being cloned from a sample of Mew's DNA, Mewtwo is an extremely powerful psychic, yet its abilities surpass Mew's due to intentional alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned from. As such, it can use telekinesis for flight, to shield itself or to powerfully throw opponents aside. In addition, it is among the very few Pokemon capable of human speech, which it does so via telepathy. Otherwise, it conserves its energy until needed. In addition to its psychic abilities, Mewtwo can regenerate, which allows it to quickly recover from near-fatal injuries. Despite being Mew's clone, Mewtwo does not share its ability to learn every single teachable move within the games. As a character in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Does he have other powers?","completion":"Yes, Mewtwo has other powers besides its psychic abilities. In addition to its powerful psychic and telekinetic powers, Mewtwo can regenerate, which allows it to quickly recover from near-fatal injuries.

Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her.

Over the last few months, there has been considerable talk that while capital spending (especially information technology spending) has been budgeted by corporations for 2001, it has, to a large extent, been 'frozen' as the economic uncertainty had taken a grip of corporate comptrollers. We believe that this latest rate cut (and possible future cuts), could well spur greater corporate confidence (as well as spur greater liquidity from the capital markets) and thus free up already allocated budgets for corporate spending.

After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King George V was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.

Information: - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime. - Baissa is a lower Cretaceous locality in Siberia, on the left bank of the Vitim River. The Zaza Formation sediments exposed at Baissa are represented mostly by sandstones, siltstones, marls and bituminous shales. The total thickness if the section is about 80 m. Insect remains occur throughout the section, except for the most coarse-grained rocks. Their abundance and state of preservation vary from one bed to another. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - Saurophthirus is an extinct genus of flea that represents a transition between primitive stem fleas , and modern species . The type species , S. longipes is found in early Cretaceous strata of Baissa , Siberia . The second species , S. exquisitus , is from the is from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation . - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Warm-blooded animal species can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, homeothermic species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are birds and mammals. Other species have various degrees of thermoregulation. - Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are external parasites of warm-blooded animals, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds. The adults are up to about long and usually brown. They are flattened sideways to enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers, and have strong claws to prevent themselves from being dislodged. They are wingless insects, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping. They can leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the facility is downsizing happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The downsizing of a recycling facility can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans and may lead to fewer cans being processed overall. It's essential to consider the various consequences that a downsizing situation might bring about and how these changes might influence the recycling process. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced Capacity: A downsized facility may have less equipment and space available for processing aluminum cans. This can result in lower recycling capacities and longer processing times. Consequently, fewer aluminum cans may be processed at a given time. 2. Layoffs or Reduced Workforce: Downsizing often includes cutting back on the workforce. With fewer workers available to handle the recycling process, this can result in slower operations and a decrease in the number of cans recycled. 3. Limited Resources: A downsized facility may have to make do with fewer resources, including energy, equipment, and funding. This can impact the efficiency of the recycling equipment, and the lack of funding may lead to outdated technology or machinery, which could slow down the recycling process. Indirect Effects: 1. Decreased Collection: As recycling facilities downsize, they may not be able to handle the same volume of incoming materials as before. This could result in a reduction of aluminum cans collected, and, in extreme cases, recycling services might halt altogether if the facility cannot support the community's recycling needs. 2. Public Perception: The downsizing of a recycling facility can negatively affect public perception of recycling. People might become less motivated to recycle their aluminum cans if they doubt the facility's capability to handle and process them efficiently. 3. Environmental and Economic Impacts: The downsizing of a recycling facility can have broader environmental and economic consequences. With fewer aluminum cans being recycled, there will be an increase in waste headed to landfills and a higher demand for raw materials and energy, leading to an adverse environmental impact. Furthermore, a reduction in recycled aluminum can affect related industries that rely on those recycled materials, leading to potential job losses and economic decline. In conclusion, while the perturbation hypothesis does not explicitly state a direct or indirect effect on the recycling process, it can be deduced that the downsizing of a recycling facility would likely have both direct and indirect effects on the process. The result would be reduced efficiency and capacity, higher waste levels, and detached public participation in recycling, ultimately leading to fewer aluminum cans being recycled overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After complications last September, he was admitted to the hospital and put on the heart transplant waiting list a month later. Micah, who wasn't expected to live through the New Year, received a new heart on December 20 - just in time for Christmas. Scroll down for video. Gift of life: Micah Muller asked Santa for a new heart and received a life-saving organ transplant just five days before Christmas. 'It's amazing,' Micah's mother LaVonne Dougherty told Fox 8 News Cleveland. 'It's surreal. Never though that we would be here. Never thought it.' One of the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital said Micah had been dying after 'a lifetime of being sick' prior to the surgery. Ms Dougherty admitted that she struggled with her emotions when her son was put on the heart transplant waiting list.

Write highlights for this article: The chairman of the House panel responsible for green-lighting war spending warned the Obama administration Thursday that ruling out 'boots on the ground' in the battle against ISIS if it formally asks Congress to authorize future military operations. 'I will not support sending our military into harm’s way with their arms tied behind their backs,' said Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, a California Republican who is in the last weeks before his retirement. He warned during a committee hearing that regardless of who holds his gavel when a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force comes to Capitol Hill from the White House, 'should the AUMF proposed by the president contain such limitations it will be DOA in Congress.' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said in the same hearing that Iraqi military forces are making progress restoring order in the Northern city of Mosul and re-establishing the country's border with Syria. As those operations gain traction, he said, the 'boots on the ground' question could be re-opened. 'I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces, but we're certainly considering it,' Dempsey told lawmakers. Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a pointed warning that Congress would refuse to sign a permission slip for war unless the option of using ground troops were left on the table. 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose': Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he;s out of the loop on a new AUMF from the White House. 'WE'RE CERTAINLY CONSIDERING IT': Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers he was open to the idea of recommending US ground troops to Obama. As it conducts a long-term military operation to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the Obama administration has been relying on an AUMF hastily passed in the weeks following al-Qaeda's September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon – and on an Iraq war resolution passed in 2003. Now, however, the enemy is ISIS, a Muslim caliphate that has rampaged across two-thirds of Syria and Iraq. Its members were expelled from al-Qaeda and the older terror group regards ISIS fighters as apostates. The result has been a White House that is relying on a battlefield permission-slip that many in Congress say is ill-fitting and obsolete. The administration has asked for 5.6 billion in new defense spending authority, raising eyebrows and new questions on the Hill as Obama pledged to double the U.S. military presence in the ISIS war while simultaneously claiming there would be no American battle engagement. McKeon warned Gen. Dempsey that 'limiting our advisers to headquarters buildings will not help newly trained Iraqi and Syrian opposition forces hold terrain, much less defeat [ISIS] in the field.' 'Yet the president has doubled down on his policy of 'no boots on the ground,' despite any advice you give him.' Texas Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry told Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel that vague commitments from the White House has made it impossible for Congress to do its job. 'Until you get words on paper it's kinda hard to make progress,' Thornberry said. Hagel was noncommittal and said the White House was internally debating whether it needs a new AUMF from lawmakers – and how a request should be worded. 'I don't know specifically what they are going to propose,' he said. 'I don't know specifically if they are going to send it up as a legislative proposal.' 'I know the president has had specific conversations with specific members of both the House and Senate on this.' Senate Democrats have found their voices since their Election Day drubbing, and have spent much of the last week demanding a vote on a new AUMF before Republicans take over committee chairmanships and swear in a new majority in January. On Wednesday at the Woodrow WIlson Center in Washington, D.C., Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine complained that the U.S. has been 'engaged in a war – that is not about imminent defense of the United States – without legal authority.' In a statement after the election, Kaine said he was 'troubled by suggestions ... that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote.' 'We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission,' he said. ANTI-WAR PROTESTS ONLY ON DAYS ENDING IN 'Y': The Code Pink group sent an activist to disrupt Thursday's proceedings. THE ENEMY: An ISIS fighter gestures from a vehicle in the countryside of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane after the terror army took control of the area last month. BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE KURDISH: While U.S. armed forces aren't carrying weapons into battle, the Peshmerga forces have been holding ISIS at bay. Republicans like North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones insist that anti-ISIS airstrikes are illegal without a congressional go-ahead. 'This is nothing more than an abdication of our constitutional responsibility,' he said Thursday. But moments later he hinted that many Republicans would play a dovish role unless the Obama administration clearly defined victory while asking for billions of dollars to achieve it. 'For goodness sakes, why in the world should be make such a commitment, and we don't even have an endpoint for it?' 'What is the end-state of what we are trying to accomplish?' he asked. 'I don't know how we convince the American people that a nation which is financially broke ... where is it coming from? Please explain to the Congress and the American people how it ends one day?' Hagel insisted that ISIS 'continues to represent a serious threat to American interests, our allies, and the Middle East ... and wields influence over a broad swath of territory in western and northern Iraq and eastern Syria.'

When their younger sister Polly asks Tom if the Queen is coming to their house, Tom says that she only exists in the story. However, the Snow Queen really does live in an icy palace in the North Pole with her three troll servants: Eric, Baggy, and Wardrobe. Her plan is to set up her huge magic mirror on a mountain to reflect the sunlight away so the entire world will become her kingdom. But the mirror falls down the mountain and lands on the trolls' flying machine where it shatters into pieces. Two of the pieces hit Tom in the eye and the heart that he falls into an evil curse. The Snow Queen sends her bats to retrieve the pieces. As they cannot take the two that are inside Tom, the Queen goes out to kidnap him. Ellie and Tom connect their sleds to a bigger sled that is revealed to be driven by the Snow Queen. She takes Tom to her palace and cuts Ellie off of her sled, causing her to fall onto a talking bird named Peeps. Ellie goes out to save Tom from her and Peeps reluctantly decides to go with her. In a snowy forest, they find a house belonging to an old woman, who appears nice, but is actually an evil witch but traps them to use Ellie's heart for her elixir of life so she can be eternally young. Peeps tricks the witch's cat, Cuddles, into chasing after him and knocking over the elixir of life, and uses the confusion to unlocks Ellie's cell.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"In principle, you should be able to choose between Aptitude Tests or an Adaptation Traineeship (which could take as long as 3 years). When deciding between these two options, there are several factors you should consider before making a choice. Each choice caters to different strengths and preferences of individuals. 1. Aptitude Tests: Aptitude tests are designed to evaluate a person's natural abilities and talents in specific areas, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, numeracy, and literacy. These tests can include standardized written exams, or more interactive assessments like puzzles and simulated scenarios. Pros: - They offer a quick and relatively straightforward method for determining an individual's inherent abilities and areas of strength. - They provide an objective assessment of skills and often benchmark performance against a large sample of other test-takers. - They can identify areas that might require additional training or support if the test-taker were to pursue a particular career path. Cons: - Aptitude tests often only provide a snapshot of a person's full capabilities and may overlook other skills or key experiences. - Test-taking skills and anxiety can impact performance during an aptitude test, potentially skewing the results. - Solely relying on aptitude test scores may not be the most effective way to identify suitable candidates for a role or a training program. 2. Adaptation Traineeship: An adaptation traineeship is a more extensive approach to evaluating an individual's potential and capability within a particular field, taking into account practical skills, soft skills, and personal growth. These traineeships typically involve an on-the-job learning component and can last up to three years. Pros: - Traineeships offer hands-on experience and expose individuals to real-world scenarios, leading to a more practical understanding of the field. - The extended length of traineeships allows for the development of deeper relationships with coworkers and supervisors, fostering mentorship and learning opportunities. - Trainees have the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills, including technical expertise and interpersonal qualities that can be invaluable in the workforce. Cons: - The longer duration of traineeships may delay the start of a person's career, potentially leading to slower career progression. - Not all candidates may have the time or resources to commit to a traineeship program, which could limit their access to certain fields. - Trainees may be paid less than fully employed professionals, causing potential financial strain. Ultimately, choosing between an aptitude test and an adaptation traineeship depends on the individual's personal circumstances, goals, and preferences. In general, if you are seeking a quick and efficient way to gauge your potential in a specific career field, an aptitude test may be more appropriate. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a more comprehensive and immersive experience that can yield practical skills and professional development, an adaptation traineeship may be the better choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Roger Federer (German pronunciation: ['rodZ@r 'fe:d@r@r]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 2 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He is regarded by many fans, players and analysts as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles--the most in history for a male player--and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 308 weeks, including 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. Federer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999 and started at the 1999 Marseille Open defeating the reigning champion of the 1998 French Open, Spaniard Carlos Moya. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset. Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis. The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer would later say that his experience with Hingis \\"definitely helped me to become the player I am today.\\" Federer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final. Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world No. 2 and eventual finalist Alex Corretja. His run to the French quarterfinals launched him into the top 15 for the first time in his career. His international breakthrough came at the 2001 Wimbledon Championships, where a 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. The teenage Swiss stunned the seven-time Wimbledon champion and No. 1 seed in a dramatic five-set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth-set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record-breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club over the next two decades. The first final he reached at the prestigious Masters level came at the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to former and future world No. 1 Andre Agassi on hard court. Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in top 10 for the first time.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"The man with long hair is walking along a storm drain.\\", does this mean that \\"A person outside on the street.\\"?","completion":"No, the sentence \\"The man with long hair is walking along a storm drain.\\" does not necessarily mean that \\"A person is outside on the street.\\" While it is true that both sentences reference a person being outside, the specific locations and details given in each sentence make them different in meaning. Let's break down the two sentences to provide more clarity. First, let's examine the original sentence: \\"The man with long hair is walking along a storm drain.\\" 1. The subject in this situation is a \\"man\\" with a specific physical description—\\"long hair.\\" 2. The action being taken by the man is \\"walking.\\" 3. The location where the man is walking is specified as \\"along a storm drain.\\" Now let's look at the second sentence that you've provided: \\"A person is outside on the street.\\" 1. The subject in this sentence is generalized as \\"a person\\" with no specific physical description or gender indicated. 2. This sentence does not specify any action which the person is taking. 3. The location is given as \\"outside\\" and \\"on the street,\\" which is a more general setting than that in the first sentence. It is clear that the two sentences are referring to different scenarios involving individuals in outdoor environments. However, the specific details and context of each sentence differ significantly. The first sentence described a man with long hair walking along a storm drain, which implies not only the gender and physical appearance of the individual but also specifies that he is walking near a drainage system. This could be in a more industrial or flood-prone area, or even a ditch alongside a road, depending on the context. On the other hand, the sentence \\"A person is outside on the street\\" is a more general statement. It does not provide any defining characteristics of the individual or any description of the actions they're taking. All that the sentence conveys is that a person is outdoors and on the street. This could mean they are standing, walking, or engaging in any other activities on a broader variety of streets or locations. In conclusion, while both sentences imply that there are outdoor settings involving people, the specific details and context of each sentence vary considerably. Therefore, the sentence \\"The man with long hair is walking along a storm drain.\\" does not necessarily mean \\"A person is outside on the street.\\""},{"prompt":"Q:Article: Dear Tim, Today is Saturday.

Later in his bunk, Alec's father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, and tells the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus' master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk; the ship has started to capsize. In the chaos, Alec grabs his knife and his Bucephalus statue, and makes his way to the black stallion and manages to free him. The stallion then jumps into the sea. Alec himself is swept overboard by a gigantic wave. Once in the water, he swims toward the stallion and managed to grab hold of the ropes of the stallion's restraints. Alec wakes on the shore of a deserted island and starts to explore. He finds the stallion caught in his restraints with the ropes stuck between the rocks. With his knife, Alec manages to free the stallion once again and the stallion runs away. For a time, the two keep their distance. Alec discovers means to survive by catching fish and seaweed. As Alec suddenly faces a cobra eye to eye, the Black comes to the rescue and kills the snake, only to run off again. By now, Alec decides to try to get closer to the horse and offer him some seaweed.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

Identifying the cause of barbering can help you figure out how to stop it. Stress, boredom, or competition for resources can all lead to barbering.","completion":"In the continuation of the paragraph on how to stop barbering in guinea pigs: 1. Address stress factors: Once you've identified stress factors that might be causing barbering, take steps to eliminate them. This can include creating a quiet and comfortable environment for your guinea pigs, avoiding sudden changes in their routine, and providing them with hiding places like small boxes or igloos that allow them to feel safe and secure. 2. Provide mental and physical stimulation: Boredom can lead to barbering, so it's important to ensure your guinea pigs have enough mental and physical stimulation. Provide them with toys designed for small animals, such as chew toys, tunnels, and exercise wheels. You can also rotate toys or rearrange their living space regularly to keep things interesting. 3. Encourage foraging behavior: Foraging is a natural behavior for guinea pigs, and it can help to reduce boredom and barbering. Scatter their food around their living space, or provide it in treat balls or puzzle feeders to encourage them to search for it. This can help to keep them engaged and decrease the likelihood of barbering. 4. Ensure they have sufficient resources: Competition for resources like food, water, or resting areas can contribute to barbering. Make sure there are enough resources for all your guinea pigs, and consider providing multiple food and water dishes and separate resting areas if you have multiple guinea pigs. 5. Regularly groom your guinea pigs: Guinea pigs can suffer from various skin conditions that may lead to barbering, such as parasites or fungal infections. Regular grooming can help to identify any issues early on and ensure your guinea pigs are healthy. Use a soft brush to gently groom your guinea pigs, and check their skin and fur for any signs of irritation or abnormal hair loss. 6. Monitor interactions between guinea pigs: If you have multiple guinea pigs, keep an eye on how they interact with each other. If they are establishing a hierarchy and barbering as a result of dominance, consider separating them temporarily and gradually reintroducing them under supervision. Make sure each guinea pig has its own space and resources to reduce aggression. 7. Consult a veterinarian: If you're unable to identify or resolve the cause of barbering, consult a veterinarian experienced in treating small animals. They can examine your guinea pigs, diagnose any underlying health issues, and recommend appropriate treatment options or changes to their environment. In summary, stopping barbering in guinea pigs involves understanding and addressing the causes of this behavior. By making changes to their environment, providing appropriate stimulation, and monitoring their health and interactions, you can help to prevent and reduce barbering in your guinea pigs and ultimately promote their overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was probably born in L'Aquila . He made prints based on designs of Pompeo Aquilano . Also 74 plates of antique statues in Rome , the joint work of Santis and Cherubino Alberti , published in 1584 . - The Apennines or Apennine Mountains (or \\"\\"a singular used in the plural) are a mountain range consisting of parallel smaller chains extending along the length of peninsular Italy. In the northwest they join with the Ligurian Alps at Altare. In the southwest they end at Reggio di Calabria, the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since the year 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has been defining the Apennines System to include the mountains of north Sicily, for a total distance of . The system forms an arc enclosing the east side of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Seas. - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Central Italy (or just ) is one of the five official statistical regions of Italy used by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a first level NUTS region and a European Parliament constituency. - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium. - Gran Sasso d'Italia (literally \\"\\"Great Rock of Italy\\"\\") is a mountain located in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. The Gran Sasso forms the centrepiece of the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park which was established in 1993 and holds the highest mountains in continental Italy south of the Alps and is part of the Apennines, the mountain range that runs the entire length of the Italian Peninsula. Teramo and L'Aquila are the nearest cities to the Gran Sasso, while Assergi, at the base of the mountain, is the nearest village; Rome is by road. - A cultural movement is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \\"neo-\\"). - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - L'Aquila (meaning \\"The Eagle\\") is a city and \\"comune\\" in Central Italy, both the capital city of the Abruzzo region and of the Province of L'Aquila. , it has a population of 70,967 inhabitants. Laid out within medieval walls on a hill in the wide valley of the Aterno river, it is surrounded by the Apennine Mountains, with the Gran Sasso d'Italia to the north-east. - Cherubino Alberti (15531615), also called Borghegiano, was an Italian engraver and painter. He is most often remembered for the Roman frescoes completed with his brother Giovanni Alberti during the papacy of Clement VIII. He was most prolific as an engraver of copper plates. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - The Province of L'Aquila (\\"Provincia dell'Aquila\\") is the largest, most mountainous and least densely populated province of the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy. It comprises about half the landmass of Abruzzo and occupies the western part of the region. It has borders with the provinces of Teramo to the north, Pescara and Chieti to the east, Isernia (in Molise region) to the south and Frosinone, Rome and Rieti (in Lazio region) to the west. Its capital is the city of L'Aquila. The Province of L'Aquila includes the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso, Maiella and Velino-Sirente), their highest peak, Corno Grande, the high plain of Campo Imperatore, and Europe's southernmost glacier, the Calderone. The province's major rivers are the Aterno-Pescara, Sangro, Liri, Salto, and the Turano; its major lakes are Lago Scanno and Lago Barrea.

First, subtract 16 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 16 = 4*z + 16 - 16 -16 = 4*z Step 3: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for z: -16 / 4 = 4*z / 4 -4 = z So the solution is z = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Threads Movie plot: The Sheffield Royal Infirmary, site of the hospital scene. Young Sheffield residents Ruth Beckett (Karen Meagher) and Jimmy Kemp (Reece Dinsdale) are planning to marry due to her unplanned pregnancy. Meanwhile, as tensions between the US and the Soviet Union over Iran escalate, the Home Office directs Sheffield City Council to assemble an emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift bomb shelter in the basement of the town hall. After the ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain is gripped by fear, with looting and rioting erupting. \\"Known subversives\\" (including peace activists and some trade unionists) are arrested and interned under the Emergency Powers Act. Curbar Edge, Peak District, where the scenes set six weeks after the attack take place. At 8:30Â a.m. GMT (3:30 in Washington, suggesting the Soviets fire first) on 26 May, the town hall office transmitter signals Attack Warning Red, and Sheffield's air raid sirens sound. Panic breaks out in the city and the Sheffield operations staff man their desks. At 8:35Â a.m. a single nuclear warhead air bursts high over the North Sea, producing an electromagnetic pulse which damages or destroys communications and most electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern Europe. Two minutes later the first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF Finningley 18 miles (29Â km) from Sheffield. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, the mushroom cloud from Finningley is clearly visible and chaos reigns in the streets, with Jimmy last seen running from his stalled truck in an attempt to reach Ruth. Sheffield is soon hit by a one megaton warhead launched at the Tinsley Viaduct. A title card states that strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the Midlands, are the primary targets, with two-thirds of all UK homes destroyed and immediate deaths ranging between 17 and 30 million.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The damage to the ozone layer leads to heavy sunlight with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The ozone layer is located in the Earth's stratosphere and plays a crucial role in protecting living organisms by absorbing harmful UV radiation from the Sun. When the ozone layer is depleted or damaged, more UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface, causing various environmental and health issues, including increased instances of skin cancer, cataracts, and harm to marine and terrestrial ecosystems. To address the movie plot provided, \\"Threads\\" is a 1984 British apocalyptic war drama that depicts the impact of a nuclear war on the city of Sheffield, England. The story portrays the harrowing consequences faced by its citizens, particularly Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp, as they navigate through the chaos and destruction following the nuclear exchange.

Sentence 1: Yeltsin's in tight wi th the old guard so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point Sentence 2: It's like picking the lesser of two evils. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Whether or not the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence can be a subjective interpretation. To analyze this, let's break down the two sentences and understand their meanings. Sentence 1: \\"Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point\\" This sentence implies that Yeltsin has a strong connection with the old guard (which could mean a group of influential or traditional members of an organization), and as a result, there may be a tough decision to be made between the lesser of two evils. It suggests that the situation implies a choice between two unfavorable or problematic options. Sentence 2: \\"It's like picking the lesser of two evils.\\" The second sentence doesn't specifically mention Yeltsin or the old guard, but it does present the idea of having to choose between two unfavorable or problematic options. Now, let's examine whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. In the context of both sentences, it's evident that the idea of choosing between the lesser of two evils is present. However, the first sentence provides specific information about the individuals involved (Yeltsin and the old guard), whereas the second sentence is a generalized statement about making a difficult choice between unfavorable options. Considering these factors, the second sentence is not entirely entailed by the first sentence, but is closely related to it. The second sentence could be derived from the first one, but it is not a complete summary of the first sentence's meaning. It leaves out the information about Yeltsin and the old guard, focusing solely on the concept of picking between the lesser of two evils. Therefore, we can say that the second sentence partially conveys the idea presented in the first sentence, without addressing the specifics involved."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What is the more familiar name for vitamin B2 ?","completion":"Vitamin B2, an essential nutrient for human health, is more commonly known as Riboflavin. It is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in maintaining overall well-being and supporting various biological processes in the body. Riboflavin belongs to the group of eight B vitamins, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the human metabolism. Riboflavin assists in multiple cellular processes, including the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into glucose for energy production. It also facilitates the conversion of other B vitamins, such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and folate, into their active forms, which are necessary for various bodily functions. Moreover, riboflavin is an important factor in maintaining healthy skin, hair, eyes, and mucous membranes. As an antioxidant, riboflavin helps in neutralizing harmful free radicals that cause damage to the body's cells, ultimately contributing to the prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases like cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. It also plays a significant role in the production of red blood cells, which are essential for transporting oxygen throughout the body. Since the human body cannot synthesize riboflavin, it must be obtained through a varied diet. Rich dietary sources of riboflavin include dairy products (such as milk, cheese, and yogurt), eggs, lean meats (including beef, poultry, and fish), green vegetables (like spinach, asparagus, and broccoli), and fortified cereals and grains. Riboflavin deficiency, though rare in developed countries, can lead to a condition known as ariboflavinosis, which results in skin disorders, cracks in the corners of the mouth, inflammation of the tongue, and sensitivity to light, among other symptoms. In summary, vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is an indispensable micronutrient for our overall health. It plays a vital role in energy production, cellular function, and growth, as well as being an antioxidant that helps neutralize harmful free radicals. By incorporating a variety of riboflavin-rich foods into our daily diet, we can ensure that we meet our body's needs for this essential B vitamin and maintain our health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a tell-all article for Daily Life, Ms Wright said: ‘I was driving along in the car recently when my daughter Ruby [name changed] asked if she could go to the doctor's and get a penis.' She said her breath caught in her throat and she tried to stay calm as she told her daughter she would ‘have to Google it when I got home’. Gender confusion: Elle Wright is determined to support her daughter, who wants to be a boy, no matter what she decides about her future. The mother, who runs a clothing store in Byron Bay on the north coast of New South Wales in Australia, said Ruby had never been interested in ‘girly’ clothes or toys. She said: ‘Ruby only wanted to play with Tonka trucks and tool belts. By the time she was three, she simply refused to wear anything remotely girlish.’ The eight-year-old now wanted to be called ‘Jack Black’, and wore her hair short with a swept-over, Justin-Bieber-style fringe. 'At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it... ‘I have no idea what the future holds for Ruby, but whatever the outcome, I’m firmly in her corner and we’ll tackle it as a team' Ruby, whom strangers often mistook for a boy, also enjoys playing ‘rough-and-tumble games’, walks with a swagger, rides skateboards and surfs like a pro. When strangers call her ‘mate’ or ‘boy’, Ruby never corrects them - and Ms Wright said she barely noticed it anymore. Until recently, Ruby had only ever wanted to play with boys. Lately she had started to play with girls - but Ms Wright said: ‘It’s definitely a different dynamic.’ The issue of Ruby's gender identity came to a head when her class went on a school camp. Boys and girls were made to sleep in different tents and Ruby was heartbroken when she was put in the girls’ tent. Ms Wright said: ‘She tried to cajole the volunteer parents into believing she was a boy, but didn’t succeed.' More...

Two years ago, the headmaster of Ruby's school called Ms Wright into the office and suggested that Ruby might be more than just a tomboy. He advised Ms Wright to start researching gender identity issues and to contact support groups so she could provide Ruby with the information she needed. Ms Wright said she did not know what the future held for Ruby, and while she did not ‘feel the need to label it at this young age’, she also wanted to be aware of the issues and supportive of her child. She added: ‘At eight years of age, Ruby is still so young, and I have no idea what the next few years will bring. But this has been present in Ruby forever, so I'm not going to overlook or ignore it. 'Once, a couple of mothers suggested I must have wanted a son because of the way I encourage Ruby to dress and behave as she does. I was shocked. I ran away and got into my car shaking with anger. I'd never felt more judged. I've also never been more resolute about letting Ruby be herself' ‘I understand that puberty can be a time of great distress for kids who have gender confusion. Depression and suicide are risks at this time. I believe with love and support you can tackle anything, so I'm going to be as prepared as I can be with information to help Ruby with whatever direction she chooses for her life.’ One option available for children who show evidence of gender dysphoria – where they feel discontent with their sex – is to take drugs that delay the onset of puberty, to give them more time to decide whether they want to begin the process of gender reassignment. Ms Wright said she knew it might be a rocky road ahead for her daughter, and she had already faced criticism from other parents.

A year later, Charlie and the others have returned to the States and have located Steve under his new false identity, changing his last name to Frizelli, moving to Los Angeles and laundering the gold for money. Charlie goes to Philadelphia and meets with Stella Bridger, John's estranged daughter and also a skilled private safecracker working for the police, who is furious with him, believing that Charlie was responsible for the death of her father, but Charlie instead convinces her to help get revenge on Steve by helping with the heist to steal back the gold. The group monitor Steve's expensive mansion in Los Angeles, identifying the various security details. Charlie gets in contact with an associate, Skinny Pete, to obtain explosives for Left Ear, to blow the mansion gates, and Rob obtains three heavily modified Mini Coopers and calls in his friend Wrench, a car mechanic, to modify them so that they will be able to drive through the mansion and carry the gold out.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Marvel Marilyn Maxwell (August 3, 1921 March 20, 1972) was an American actress and entertainer.

News article: Police have now discovered the strap was actually found just 4.5 metres (14.7ft) away from a pool of Mr Lawrence's blood and eight metres (26.2ft) away from his bag. Officers believe it may have been part of a weapon used to fatally injure the student as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south east London, in April 1993. Chris Le Pere, the senior investigating officer, said it was similar to a homemade weapon found in the home of David Norris, one of the men convicted of the murder. The admission comes amid an investigation into alleged police corruption in relation to the murder inquiry, which was launched by the National Crime Agency (NCA) last year and is still ongoing. ||||| Confusion over punctuation led to a potentially vital piece of evidence in the Stephen Lawrence murder case being overlooked for 21 years, a senior investigator has revealed. Chris Le Pere, the man now leading a fresh investigation into the 1993 killing, said the error led to a bag strap that may have been used as a home-made weapon being wrongly recorded as discovered almost 100 yards away from where Stephen was targeted by racist thugs. In fact, said Mr Le Pere, the strap was really found just five yards (4.6m) from the bloodstains marking the spot in Eltham, south east London, where 18-year-old Stephen was subjected to an unprovoked attack by up to six youths on April 22 1993. Mr Le Pere said the error happened because in 1993 someone compiling a formal statement misread the punctuation of notes made at the murder scene. This led to them mistakenly thinking the strap had been found at the same place as the next clue mentioned in the notes, moving it, in the minds of two decades’ worth of detectives, about 100 metres away from its correct location at the heart of the murder scene. Police have now offered a reward of up to £20,000 for details leading to the prosecution of anyone involved in the murder and used a televised reconstruction of the attack to issue a public appeal for information about the strap. “I believe this had been left at the scene by the suspects,” said Mr Le Pere, speaking hours before the reconstruction was broadcast on the BBC’s Crimewatch. Police are appealing for information about this bag strap, found at the Stephen Lawrence murder scene (Met Police) Mr Le Pere added that his belief the strap formed part of a home-made weapon was based on the fact that in 1993 a hefty claw hammer head with a strap attached to it, presumably so it could be swung at people, was found at the home of David Norris, one of the original suspects. He explained that the bag strap did not have tyre marks on it, suggesting it had been lying in the road for only a short time before being discovered by the original investigators, and added: “It has been through a degree of violence. It has a bent buckle and has also been ripped.” The discovery of the importance of the bag strap is the latest twist in a murder investigation that has been dogged by controversy for decades.

There have also been claims that the original murder inquiry was hampered by police corruption, which led last year to the National Crime Agency launching an investigation under the direction of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Mr Le Pere, however, stressed he believed the error over the bag strap’s location was “an honest mistake” instead of misconduct. It has now been established that the strap was found 16 yards from the pavement and just five yards from Stephen's bloodstains (Met Police) He said that in 1993 a senior crime scene examiner had visited the murder spot and noted the correct location of the strap – in the road, at the junction of Dickson Road and Well Hall Road, 16 yards (14.6m) from the pavement, roughly in line with Stephen’s own bag, which was seven yards (6.4m) from the pavement, and his blood, which was found 11 yards (10m) from the kerb. But, said Mr Le Pere, when the time came for writing formal statements, the crime scene examiner was abroad on another investigation and unavailable. Although the examiner subsequently signed the paperwork, said Mr Le Pere “Someone else – I don’t know who – wrote up the statements. The scenes examiners would have read [their statements] but they wouldn’t have had their original notes to refer to.” Whoever did write the formal statement, said Mr Le Pere, misread the original, on-the-spot notes made by the crime scene examiner. “The punctuation has not been read correctly,” said Mr Le Pere. “He [the crime scene examiner] correctly described the strap as being at the mouth of Dickson Road. The next exhibit was found outside 290 Well Hall Road – 80 to 90 metres [87 to 90 yards] away – and they [whoever wrote the statement] have joined these two exhibits together thinking they were both outside number 290.” Mr Le Pere said he discovered the mistake in 2014 after reading the original crime scene notes. After realising its potential significance he and his police team took 70 samples of the 66cm-long, 1.7cm-wide black leather bag strap for DNA tests using highly sophisticated techniques that weren’t available to investigators in 1993. These established that the bag had at one stage owned by a woman, leading to the theory that the strap was either unwittingly given to one of the attackers or taken from a stolen bag. Since January Mr Le Pere’s team have conducted DNA tests on friends and relatives of the suspects in the original investigation, and on the seven women who had their bags stolen in Greenwich – the borough containing Eltham – in the seven days preceding the murder. Mr Le Pere said more than 110 people were spoken to in connection with the strap. Two were not tested for medical reasons, 50 individuals volunteered samples, 12 did not respond to the police and 46 declined to undergo a DNA test. Mr Le Pere said there was no legal obligation for people to volunteer a DNA sample, and there had been “an awful lot” of negative responses among “associates and relatives of the key suspects”. Requesting information about the original owner of the bag, he stressed that they would be questioned as a witness, not as a potential suspect. “There is no evidence to suggest a woman was involved in the murder of Stephen Lawrence,” he said. Stephen Lawrence's father makes plea following new DNA evidence Stephen, a talented A-level student with ambitions to become an architect, suffered two deep stab wounds during the attack and was declared dead in hospital. Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight were arrested in connection with the murder in 1993, but only Neil Acourt and Luke Knight were charged with murder. The case was dropped the same year due to questions over the reliability of witness evidence; a subsequent private prosecution by the Lawrence family also failed. But in 2012, after the Government dropped the so-called double jeopardy rule, Norris and Dobson were convicted of the murder and sentenced to minimum terms of 15 years and two months and 14 years and three months. The following year the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he had no plans to close the investigation and warned those who had joined Norris and Dobson in the attack on Stephen: “We are after you.” Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8785 8310 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. ||||| Image caption Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he was murdered at a south-east London bus stop in 1993 A handbag strap found at the scene of Stephen Lawrence's murder may have been part of a homemade weapon used by his killers, the Met Police believe. The strap was recovered a few metres away from the south-east London bus stop where the 18 year old was attacked by six white men in August 1993. Detectives discounted the strap for years because it was mistakenly logged as being found 80 metres away. The DNA of an unknown woman has been found on the bag strap, the Met said. Detectives believe the DNA is that of the main user of the bag and are attempting to trace her, although they are not linking the woman with the murder directly. Mr Lawrence was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist assault on 22 April 1993 as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London with a friend. In January 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of being involved in the attack and jailed for life but detectives have always maintained others were involved. Image copyright Me Police Image caption A misunderstanding of a crime scene examiner's field notes meant the strap was thought to have been found much further away from the murder scene than it actually was They now want to find who owned the bag from which the strap came and discover why it was at the murder scene. Chris Le Pere, the senior investigating detective, said: \\"She [the bag owner] is a witness. There is no evidence to suggest a female was involved in the murder of Stephen Lawrence.\\" One theory being investigated is that the strap was left at the scene by the murderers and it came from an \\"adapted offensive weapon\\". A similar strap with a hammer-head attached was found at David Norris's house when he was arrested in 1993 on suspicion of murder. Attempts to link the DNA found on the strap have failed. Female associates, friends and relatives of all the key suspects have been asked to provide DNA but most have refused, the Met said. Victims of bag theft in the area at the time of the murder have also been traced. Analysis: Danny Shaw, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent: Could the black leather bag strap be the breakthrough which proves that a suspect was at the scene of Stephen Lawrence's murder? The strap, which only investigators and crime scene examiners appeared to know about, has suddenly assumed enormous significance given that it was far closer to the attack than was previously thought. It could have been ripped off a bag during a mugging or taken from a bag belonging to a friend or relative of one of the suspects. If detectives can find out who it belongs to, they'll be closer to establishing who brought it to the murder scene. Little strands like this, threaded together with other evidence, can solve crimes. But the fact police are appealing for information now, not 23 years ago, puts them at a huge disadvantage - and is another reminder of how tragic it is that the original investigation into Stephen's murder was so badly flawed. Image copyright Met Police The black leather strap is believed to have been left in Dickson Road, by the junction with Well Hall Road. It was initially recorded as having been 80m away from the murder scene but in 2014 officers established it was discarded only a few metres from where Stephen was set upon. Mr Le Pere described the discrepancy as an \\"honest mistake\\", adding: \\"In my judgment there is no misconduct involved in this.\\" The location of the strap was correctly recorded in notes by examiners who recovered exhibits at the scene. But when their statements were written up by colleagues \\"the punctuation hasn't been read correctly\\" Mr Le Pere said. Mr Lawrence's own bag was found around six metres (20 feet) from a footway, his blood was 10 metres (32 feet) away and the strap was 15 metres (50 feet) away, according to the revised position. Image copyright PA Image caption Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of murder in 2012 The latest developments come on the eve of what would have been Stephen Lawrence's 42nd birthday. The Met Police has offered a reward of up to £20,000 to identity and prosecute perpetrators of the murder. His father, Neville Lawrence, has also appealed for further information about the murder. Officers have spoken to around 110 people in connection with this line of inquiry, and gathered 50 DNA samples. Police are still trying to trace a man reportedly seen in a distinctive green jacket with a V emblem near Well Hall Road roundabout at about the time Mr Lawrence was attacked. CCTV footage, recently digitally enhanced, showed the man in a nearby off-licence hours before the murder took place. In a sketch by a police artist, based on their accounts, the wearer of the jacket has light reddish hair. However the man in the CCTV pictures is dark-haired. Police believe the man could be a witness. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A potentially crucial piece of evidence in the Stephen Lawrence murder case was overlooked for 21 years due to confusion over punctuation, according to a senior investigator.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham.

Write an article based on this \\"Tuck the skin flap over the skin tear, if possible. Use petroleum jelly gauze. Wrap the area with a Kerlix bandage. Replace the bandages regularly.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Properly Treating Skin Tears Introduction: Skin tears are common yet painful injuries that can result from falls, direct trauma, or even age-related skin fragility. They are particularly prevalent among the elderly and those with chronic conditions affecting their skin health. Prompt and effective treatment is crucial to minimize the risk of infection, reduce pain and expedite the healing process. In this article, we will be discussing how to properly care for a skin tear, using a tried-and-true method which includes: tucking the skin flap, applying petroleum jelly gauze and wrapping the area with a Kerlix bandage. Step 1: Assess the Injury and Clean the Wound Before starting any treatment, it is essential to assess the severity of the skin tear. If the wound is deep, actively bleeding, or showing signs of infection, it is crucial to seek professional medical assistance immediately. Otherwise, gently clean the wound using mild soap and water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat, the area dry with a clean towel or gauze. Step 2: Tuck the Skin Flap If there is a skin flap present, carefully tuck it over the skin tear, if possible. This step is crucial as it aids in preserving the flap, encourages faster re-adherence, and creates a barrier against infection. Step 3: Apply Petroleum Jelly Gauze Using petroleum jelly gauze can greatly help in preventing the wound from drying out and sticking to the dressing. Gently apply a layer of petroleum jelly to a sterile gauze pad and place it over the skin tear. Petroleum jelly provides a moist environment that promotes healing while reducing inflammation and pain. Step 4: Wrap the Area with a Kerlix Bandage To secure the petroleum jelly gauze and provide gentle compression, wrap the area with a Kerlix bandage. This type of bandage has a unique, open-weave design that allows the wound to breathe while minimizing the risk of infection. Ensure the bandage is snug but not too tight, as excessive pressure can cause further damage to the wound and impede healing. Step 5: Replace the Bandages Regularly In order to maintain optimal healing conditions, it is imperative to regularly replace the petroleum jelly gauze and Kerlix bandage. This process should be done at least once a day or more frequently if the bandages become soiled or saturated with wound drainage. Remember to gently clean the wound each time the dressings are changed. Conclusion: Skin tears can be painful and distressing, but with proper care and adherence to the outlined steps, the healing process can be accelerated while reducing the risk of complications. Always consult with a healthcare professional if the wound isn't healing as expected or becomes infected. Prevention is key, so take necessary precautions like using moisturizers, avoiding trauma, and maintaining a balanced diet to help keep your skin healthy and resilient."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...

If you have to leave something on the stove to measure an ingredient it could over-thicken or burn quickly. Have everything you need ready and measured ahead of time.","completion":"To ensure a smooth and delicious brown gravy, carefully follow these steps. First, heat a saucepan over medium heat and melt 2 tablespoons of butter, allowing it to slightly brown without burning. Next, whisk in 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, continuously stirring for about 1-2 minutes to create a roux. This cooked mixture will act as a thickening agent for your gravy. Gradually pour in 2 cups of beef or chicken broth, depending on your preference, ensuring you continue to whisk as you pour to avoid any lumps. As the mixture heats up, it will begin to thicken. You should season your gravy with salt, pepper, and 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder to enhance the flavor. If desired, you can also add a splash of Worcestershire sauce for additional depth. Bring the gravy to a gentle simmer, and cook until it reaches your desired consistency (around 5-10 minutes). Be sure to consistently whisk the mixture to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan and burning. Once you've achieved a velvety texture, taste the gravy and adjust the seasonings as needed. If the consistency is too thick, you can add more broth to thin it out. Finally, remove the saucepan from heat and allow it to cool slightly before serving. Your homemade brown gravy can be poured over dishes such as mashed potatoes, roast meat, or vegetables, elevating their flavors by adding a layer of warmth and richness. With attention to detail and proper preparation, you can create a delicious and decadent brown gravy that will earn rave reviews from family and friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was suffering from museum fatigue.","completion":"No, fatigue is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences. While the core idea of fatigue involves tiredness, exhaustion, or a lack of energy, the context and circumstances in which it is being used in these two sentences differ significantly. Let's examine the two cases individually to better understand the differences. Sentence 1: \\"He was hospitalized for extreme fatigue.\\" In this sentence, the term 'fatigue' refers to a physical and/or mental state of exhaustion, possibly caused by overexertion, stress, or a medical condition. In this context, 'extreme fatigue' may indicate a severe level of tiredness that necessitates medical attention. It could impair the individual's ability to perform daily tasks, potentially indicating an underlying health issue. The reasons for fatigue in this case could be numerous, including sleep deprivation, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or even an infection. The fact that the person was hospitalized indicates the seriousness of the situation, and a medical professional would need to evaluate the patient's condition to identify the cause of fatigue and provide appropriate treatment or intervention. Sentence 2: \\"He was suffering from museum fatigue.\\" In this sentence, 'museum fatigue' refers to a specific phenomenon where an individual feels tired or overwhelmed while visiting a museum or another cultural institution that requires prolonged attention and concentration. Museum fatigue typically stems from cognitive overload, sensory overstimulation, or the sheer volume of information and exhibits a visitor encounters. This type of fatigue is generally temporary and is not indicative of an underlying medical condition or any severe exhaustion as it might be in the first sentence. Instead, it is a situational feeling related to a particular experience and environment. To combat museum fatigue, visitors can take regular breaks, limit the amount of time spent in each exhibition, or even revisit the museum over multiple days to fully appreciate the exhibits without feeling weary. In conclusion, while fatigue as a concept may involve feelings of tiredness, its use in these two sentences implies different circumstances and degrees of severity. In the first sentence, fatigue highlights a potential health concern requiring immediate medical care, whereas, in the second one, it denotes a temporary, situational experience caused by mental overstimulation related to a specific event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Three days later, Soviet militsiya officer Arkady Renko (William Hurt) investigates the discovery of their bodies a short distance from the skating rink. All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed with surgical instruments. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces.During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York police detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko also makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna Pacua).Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina. He discovers that the three were busy constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts over time, during their polite but tense conversations in social settings. When Irina is attacked by a KGB officer who attempts to inject her with a fatal overdose of drugs, Renko saves her. Nursing her back to health in his apartment, they begin an affair.Kirwill finally locates the barn where the three victims were building Osborne's chest.

This confession marks a critical turning point, as it solidifies Irina's decision to join forces with Renko, who is determined to uncover the truth and bring Osborne to justice. This partnership contributes to the ultimate resolution of the investigation and to Renko's relentless pursuit of uncovering the truth behind the brutal murders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A small-time Latin American cocaine trafficker I've known for years introduced me to Jose. Jose is old school. He tells me he's been in the cocaine trade since the early 1980s almost since it began, has worked internationally and done a stretch in prison. \\"From the outside it might look like the cartels are just going around killing people. But on the inside there's a code of conduct, rules. You might not want to kill somebody but you have to because it's all about respect,\\" he said. \\"This cannot work if there's no respect. Above all, the capos use logic to solve the problems.\\" Jose added that he believed groups of corrupt officials and law enforcement officers were using the militarization of the border region not as a means to crush the drug cartels but as a way of forcing them to pay a bigger slice of the drug profits as bribes. \\"The authorities and the cartels use the rule of 10. By that I mean for every 10 kilos of cocaine we move, we have to give three to the authorities and keep seven for ourselves,\\" he explained. \\"When times are bad the authorities may arrest somebody or grab an entire consignment and that's a way for forcing up their percentage take.\\" Jose's assertion might seem like feverish conspiracy theory if it weren't for the growing list of Mexican officials, ranging from local cops and foot soldiers to generals and men at the highest levels of law enforcement, who've been busted for allegedly profiting from the drug trade. In November, Mexico's former drug czar was detained on suspicion that he may have accepted 450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers. He had been in charge of the attorney general's office that specializes in combating organized crime.

If your dog isn’t trained to “sit” and “stay,” you or a partner will need to hold the dog still while you put on the harness. The neck hole should look like a circle that fits over your dog’s head and shoulders. Find the D-ring for the leash, then position it either in the front or the back, depending on where it's supposed to go. Slide the harness over the dog's head and position it low on the dog's shoulder area so it isn't around the neck. The neck hole is usually the smallest hole on the harness. The side straps will be attached to the neck hole on each side. You want the harness to rest against the dog's body rather than around its neck. If your overhead harness has a vest or comfort shield attached, make sure the outside of the fabric is facing away from your dog. Your harness should have a leg loop on one side. Lift the dog’s paw up off the floor and slide it into the loop. Then, put your dog’s paw down on the floor. If your harness clips in place on both sides, you’ll need to clip the straps around the first leg. Wrap the two straps around the leg, then clip the buckle. This will turn the strap into a leg loop. Make sure the strap goes under and behind the dog’s leg, which is important for control. Once the harness is on your dog, it will look like both legs are inserted into side loops. The strap that you looped behind the dog’s leg will clip into a buckle on the dog’s back. Push both sides of the buckle together, then listen for the “click.” Test the buckle to make sure it’s secure. You should be able to pull up on the buckle without it coming apart. Slide the adjusters to tighten or loosen straps, as necessary. Pull on the straps to check that the neck hole and leg loops aren't loose enough for your dog to get out of them. Then, check that you can put 2 fingers under the straps to ensure it's not too snug. You should adjust the harness every time you use it. Putting on the harness should be a pleasant experience for your dog. This teaches it to like putting on its harness, making it easier to outfit the dog for future walks. Summary:","completion":"In summary, fitting a harness properly on your dog involves several key steps. Firstly, position your dog to sit in front of you. If your dog is not trained to \\"sit\\" and \\"stay\\", you may need some help to keep it still while you fit the harness. Identify the neck hole of the harness, which is typically the smallest circle, and slide it over your dog’s head to rest on its shoulders but not around the neck. Also, identify the D-ring which is where the leash will be attached. This ring could be positioned either at the front or the back of the harness. Once the harness is properly positioned, lift the dog's paw and slide it into the side loop, then have the dog place its paw back on the ground. If your harness has clips on both sides, wrap the two straps around the leg and clip the buckle to secure it, ensuring the strap goes under and behind the dog's leg for better control. Once the harness is fully on, both the dog's legs should be inserted into side loops. Next, you will secure the harness on the dog's back by clipping the strap from behind the dog's leg into a buckle on the dog's back. Confirm if it is securely clipped by listening for a \\"click\\". Finally, adjust the fit of the harness by sliding the adjusters. Check the tightness by seeing if you can insert two fingers under the straps, ensuring it's not too loose for the dog to escape from it, or too tight to be uncomfortable. This process should always be carried out gently and positively to make the harness wearing experience a good one for your dog's future walks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Microsoft's Paul Allen launches major conservation project during 'shark week' Saving sharks from extinction may not be the first thing that comes to mind during Shark Week, which is famous for frightening tales of shark attacks. But a new project spearheaded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's charity aims to help conserve sharks worldwide, which face threats from human fishing, pollution, climate change and other causes. While the recent rise in shark attacks along the East Coast certainly don't bolster general sympathy toward the sea creatures, this lack of awareness is also largely due to the fact that there are many things that we simply don't know about these creatures, which live in the vast abyss of the ocean. On Tuesday, Vulcan Inc. announced the Global FinPrint initiative, a research survey designed to provide key data needed in order to design and implement plans to save sharks from extinction. Vulcan Inc. is a private investment company run by Microsoft founder Paul Allen, who also started the Great Elephant Census to combat Africa's elephant extinction crisis. I've seen the impact of @ElephantCount, now I'm supporting @GlobalFinPrint to help #SaveSharks http://t.co/lVGNP1lX8e pic.twitter.com/DoVZSAvOvK — Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) July 8, 2015 The company is investing 4 million in the GlobalFinPrint initiative, which will work with renowned shark researchers worldwide to uncover essential information to build a conservation program. Dune Ives, Vulcan's senior director of philanthropy, told Mashable that the initiative came about after she attended an ocean summit in 2014 where conversations focused on why the ocean was losing so many sharks every year. \\"No one knew the answers. There were bits and pieces of research that had already been done, but I wasn't able to find a source for why,\\" she says. Global FinPrint plans to survey sharks and rays, which are closely related species, in coral reef ecosystems over the course of three years. The largest such survey of its kind, it kicks off this month with underwater surveys and data collections conducted by a team led by Demian Chapman, a shark researcher at Stony Brook University in New York. Chapman told Mashable that the initiative will primarily seek to study the relationships between coral reefs, sharks and rays around the world as well as answer the question of why sharks might be especially important for the health of coral reef ecosystems. Having studied sharks for about 20 years, Chapman has several ideas about why sharks are essential to these hotspots of biodiversity. \\"We think some [sharks] are apex predators, like the lions or tigers or wolves of the ocean. They help keep the balance of the ecosystem,\\" he says. Without them, the marine food chain would be fundamentally altered, and knocked out of balance. As a vital part of the food chain, they provide a balance that protects the greater ecosystem. However, Chapman also says that we need a lot more data to see just how big of a role sharks play — which the survey is hoping to accomplish. Shark Week is famous for pitting sharks as deadly predators that pose a threat to our beach trips, when in fact, nearly 100 million sharks are killed annually by humans, whether by accident or for sport. On the other hand, the number of humans killed by sharks typically averages at less than five a year. Chapman says that the project could be expanded into \\"multiple years\\" to accumulate more data. Although the contract with Vulcan is only currently signed for those three years, Ives said, \\"we are absolutely open to further investment.\\" According to Chapman, Global FinPrint has already kicked off and set baited remote underwater video to survey sharks in the Bahamas and in Belize. Survey results will be published in scientific journals and be used to advance conservation efforts for sharks and the reefs that many of them depend on. \\"The Bahamas will be interesting to study,\\" he says, \\"because they haven't commercially fished sharks in over 20 years.\\" According to Vulcan's news release, Global FinPrint will survey more than 400 locations across three key geographic regions where data gaps exist: the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the tropical western Atlantic, and the islands off the coast of southern and eastern Africa, including parts of the Indian Ocean. \\"Where you might see more involvement with us is on the technology development side, where we're looking at things we can do to help advance technology about how you how you conduct BRUVs,\\" Ives says, using the acronym for the underwater cameras. All in all, Ives is hoping that the research causes people to think deeply about the repercussions of the possible extinction of sharks. \\"How does the presence or absence of apex sharks change the ecosystem? We don't think about it as often as we should. What happens to the coral reefs, and what happens to the other species in the ocean? I'm really hoping those are the questions on people's minds,\\" she said. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To protect your tomato plants on a cold evening, OPTIONS: A). cover the plants with plastic when temperatures drop below 32 degrees.; B). cover the plants with paper when temperatures drop below 32 degrees.;","completion":"To determine which solution is better for the given goal, it is important to analyze each option and understand the benefits and potential drawbacks of each. Step 1: Analyze Option A (covering the plants with plastic) Benefits: Plastic can protect the plants from frost and cold winds, helping to create a warmer environment for the plants. It also prevents direct contact of the cold air with the plant. Drawbacks: Plastic is not breathable and may cause increased moisture inside, leading to an unfavorable growing environment and potentially encouraging mold or fungus growth. Step 2: Analyze Option B (covering the plants with paper) Benefits: Paper can provide some level of insulation from the cold and frost, while also being more breathable compared to plastic. This helps in maintaining a better balance of moisture and temperature for the plants. Drawbacks: Paper may not be as effective as plastic in creating a warmer environment. Additionally, paper may not be as durable and could easily become wet or damaged in adverse weather conditions. Step 3: Compare both options Both plastic and paper have their own sets of benefits and drawbacks when it comes to protecting tomato plants from cold evenings. However, considering the balance of temperature and moisture, paper seems to be the better choice. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, Option B (covering the plants with paper when temperatures drop below 32 degrees) appears to be the better solution for protecting tomato plants on a cold evening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Former Partick Thistle player Jordan McMillan is the only British footballer currently banned, for taking cocaine. But the Scottish Football Association, which does not fund any testing, says football in Scotland is \\"clean\\". UK Anti-Doping, which compiles the tests, said it was up to sports to decide if drug testing was important. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead told BBC Sport. \\"Is it important? If it is, then put your hand in your pocket and start paying towards your programme. \\"We as an organisation can only do so much.\\" The SFA's latest turnover was £33.6m. The eight tests excludes those by Scottish internationals or teams in Uefa club competitions but there were 1,583 tests in English football over the same period from April to December 2015. In Scottish Rugby Union there were 103 tests. But an SFA spokesman told BBC Sport: \\"We are ever-vigilant of the global threat of doping in sport and have discussed the possibility of Ukad extending their provision in Scottish football. \\"We remain in constant dialogue with UKAD and the intelligence-led system has already proven to be robust. We are proud and protective of our reputation as a clean sport.\\" Scotland's eight in-competition tests for nine months of this financial year were all carried out in the six months between April and September 2015, meaning that for the latest documented quarter from October to December there was no testing in domestic Scottish football at all. The FA, whose latest turnover was £332m and funds the majority of its programme, has administered 580 in-competition tests and 1,003 out-of-competition tests over the last nine months, with Scottish Rugby Union performing four in-competition tests and 98 out-of-competition tests. The number of tests carried out in Scottish football has also dropped from 144 in 2012-13 to 44 in 2014-15 before what appears to be a further reduction this year. Sapstead said the decrease was down to limited resources at Ukad, which receives £7m a year from the government, and an intelligence-led approach which suggests Scottish football is not a risk compared to other sports. \\"I think it's wrong to compare what was going on four or five years with now because we are a very different beast when it comes to an anti-doping organisation,\\" Sapstead said. \\"Some of it is about money, it's not that we can't afford to test in Scotland, but if our intelligence was telling us that there was an issue in Scottish football, then we would be putting our resources into that area.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has previously called for more testing in football, with Sapstead also declaring the sport was \\"at risk\\". But the FA said her comments were \\"unhelpful\\" and \\"misleading\\" with Wenger later clarifying that he believed English football was clean. The FA goes one step further than Ukad by banning players who are caught taking recreational drugs out of competition. Last season there were nine violations, with eight for social drugs. The last British footballer to be banned for taking a performance-enhancing drug was Gerard Kinsella, formerly of Fleetwood Town, for taking nandrolone. Sapstead added: \\"The FA invest heavily into a testing and education programme with us. It's a robust programme and it's a high priority. Whether they identify it as a higher risk or otherwise, it's clearly something they want to invest in. \\"Clearly what motivates governing bodies is different, and it might be that given the profile of Scottish football, maybe it's felt the players don't warrant the sort of attention the English FA wants to place on its players.\\" The Scottish FA also said that it launched a campaign in 2014 called 'Keep it Clean' to \\"protect the reputation of the national game by providing a free hotline to report any integrity-related issues, including doping\\".","completion":"The Scottish Football Association (SFA) maintains that football in Scotland is clean despite significant criticism over the lack of drug testing, with only eight tests performed in nine months in the country; in contrast, 1,583 tests were carried out in English football over the same period.

A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water, meaning it releases a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) when it is mixed with water. In contrast, a weaker acid only partially dissociates, resulting in a lower concentration of hydrogen ions. The greater concentration of hydrogen ions in a strong acid makes it more reactive and better able to donate protons to other molecules, which is the basis of its acidic properties.

As the top of the sink is being cleaned, any excess water or residue is rinsed off to maintain a pristine working environment. Once the top is thoroughly scrubbed, attention is shifted to the bowl of the sink, where the power drill brush is methodically used to tackle any stains, food particles, and other debris that may have accumulated. In addition, the power drill brush can also be used with cleaning agents to enhance its effectiveness in removing stubborn stains and disinfecting the sink. Simply apply the cleaning agent, either in liquid, gel, or powder form, on the sink's surface or the power drill brush before starting the scrubbing process. This ensures that the cleaning solution penetrates deep into the crevices and can break down tough stains, making the work of the power drill brush even more efficient. After the sink has been thoroughly cleaned, it's essential to rinse off any traces of cleaning agents or debris to ensure a sparkling clean finish. This can be done using a steady stream of water from the faucet, or a clean, damp cloth can be used to wipe down the surface thoroughly. The sink should then be left to air dry or gently wiped with a clean, dry cloth to eliminate any streaks and water marks. When using a power drill brush for cleaning, it's also important to regularly check the brush attachment for signs of wear and tear. Since the bristles can become deformed or damaged with constant use, it's a good practice to inspect the brush before and after cleaning sessions. If necessary, consider replacing the brush attachment with a new one to maintain optimal cleaning efficiency.

He decide to choose the OPTIONS: - plate , because it was shorter.; - vase , because it was shorter.;","completion":"Jim had an art lesson in which he could choose to make either a plate or a vase. He decided to choose the plate, because it was shorter. This decision was based on several factors that influenced his choice, such as time constraints, the complexity of the project, and his personal preference for the practicality and usefulness of the item created. Firstly, Jim was aware that he had limited time for the art lesson, and choosing the shorter project would allow him to complete it within the allotted time. This would ensure that he could focus on the quality of his work and not rush through the process, which could potentially affect the final outcome. By choosing the plate, he could manage his time effectively and have a greater sense of accomplishment when he finished the project. Secondly, the complexity of the project was an important consideration for Jim because he was still honing his skills as an artist and felt more comfortable with the simpler design of the plate. The vase, on the other hand, required more expertise in shaping and detailing, which could have been frustrating or challenging for Jim at his current skill level. Choosing the plate allowed him to practice his art techniques confidently and not be overwhelmed by tackling a more complex project. Another significant factor was Jim's preference for practical and useful items. He believed that creating a plate would be more beneficial and versatile for his everyday life, as it could be used for serving food or even as a decorative piece for displaying other objects. The vase, while visually appealing, might not have had as much use or purpose for Jim, who valued functionality in his art projects. Lastly, Jim felt it was important to consider his level of interest and excitement about the project. By choosing the plate, he found that he was more enthusiastic about the entire creative process and felt motivated to put in his best effort. In contrast, the prospect of making a vase did not spark the same level of excitement, which could have led to a lack of motivation and a lesser-quality final product. In conclusion, Jim opted for the plate over the vase due to its shorter completion time, simpler design, practicality, and the emotional connection he had with the project. This decision ultimately allowed him to have a more enjoyable and fulfilling art lesson, while also creating a functional and versatile piece of art that he could use in his daily life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: How to Cut Out Pattern To Make BiFold Wallet","completion":"To make a bifold wallet, you'll need to carefully cut out a pattern and assemble the fabric or leather pieces. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Gather materials: To begin with, gather all the necessary materials and tools you will need. These include: - Fabric or leather: Choose a durable, high-quality material for your wallet. - Pattern: You can find wallet patterns online, in sewing books, or you can create your own. - Scissors or a rotary cutter: You'll need these to cut the pattern and materials accurately. - Ruler - Pen or pencil (for tracing) - Pins or fabric weights - Sewing machine (or needle and thread if sewing by hand) - Iron (for fabric wallets) 2. Print or create your wallet pattern: If you found a printable pattern online, print it out and make sure it's to scale. You may need to adjust the print settings to ensure the proper scale. Alternatively, if you decide to create your own pattern, sketch it out on a sheet of paper, being sure to account for seam allowances. 3. Cut out the pattern: Carefully cut out your paper wallet pattern using scissors. Be precise to ensure the accuracy of your wallet shape and size. 4. Prepare your fabric or leather: First, ensure your material is clean and pressed. If using fabric, iron it to remove any wrinkles or creases. If using leather, wipe it down with a damp cloth to remove any dust. 5. Trace the pattern onto the material: Lay the material on a flat surface. Position the pattern on top, ensuring that the grain of the fabric or leather is aligned correctly. This will help the wallet maintain its shape over time. Use a pen or pencil to trace around the pattern directly onto the material. - If using fabric, pin the pattern to the fabric or use fabric weights to prevent it from shifting. - If using leather, you can use tape to keep the pattern in place. 6. Cut out the wallet pieces: With your scissors or rotary cutter, carefully cut along the traced lines. Be precise and take your time to ensure smooth edges. - For fabric wallets, you may want to cut two sets of pieces, one for the outer wallet and one for the lining. - For leather wallets, you should only need to cut out one set of pieces. 7. Mark any additional lines required: Depending on your wallet pattern, you may need to mark additional lines such as fold or stitch lines. Use your ruler and pen or pencil to make these marks. 8. Assemble and sew the wallet: Once you have all the wallet pieces cut out, follow the sewing or assembly instructions provided with your pattern. This could include: - Sewing the outer wallet and lining pieces together, and then sewing in any additional pockets or card slots. - Folding and sewing the wallet in half, and adding a binding or edge finish to protect the raw edges of the fabric or leather. - Adding snaps, buttons, or closures to keep the wallet secure. 9. Finish the wallet: Trim any excess fabric or leather and give your wallet a final press with an iron if using fabric. Your bifold wallet is now complete and ready to be used! Remember, practice makes perfect. It may take a few attempts to perfect your wallet-making skills, but with patience and perseverance, you'll soon have a custom, handmade bi-fold wallet to be proud of."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Qing dynasty: The Qing organization of provinces was based on the fifteen administrative units set up by the Ming dynasty, later made into eighteen provinces by splitting for example, Huguang into Hubei and Hunan provinces. The provincial bureaucracy continued the Yuan and Ming practice of three parallel lines, civil, military, and censorate, or surveillance. Each province was administered by a governor (巡撫, xunfu) and a provincial military commander (提督, tidu). Below the province were prefectures (府, fu) operating under a prefect (知府, zhīfǔ), followed by subprefectures under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the county, overseen by a county magistrate. The eighteen provinces are also known as \\"China proper\\". The position of viceroy or governor-general (總督, zongdu) was the highest rank in the provincial administration. There were eight regional viceroys in China proper, each usually took charge of two or three provinces.

Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians. Question: \\"Why didn't Katherine have proper documentation of rent?\\" Answer: \\"Because the landlord wouldn't provide them\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. Katherine didn't have proper documentation of rent because she began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, and thus, the landlord wouldn't provide rent receipts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What sentence would provide a factual answer to this question: \\"If someone has a bag of old sandwich wrappers, they way that they can do damage to the area they live in is to\\"","completion":"If someone has a bag of old sandwich wrappers, the way that they can do damage to the area they live in is to improperly dispose of them, thus contributing to pollution, environmental hazards, and potential harm to the local ecosystem. One of the most significant problems associated with improper disposal of waste materials, such as old sandwich wrappers, is pollution. When individuals throw away their trash carelessly or without following the recommended waste management practices, it can end up in streets, waterways, and other public spaces. This not only creates an unsightly and unhygienic environment but also poses risks to wildlife, as they may mistake the garbage for food or become entangled in the debris. Moreover, it could lead to soil contamination due to the potential presence of hazardous substances or chemicals that may leach from the sandwich wrappers into the ground. Over time, this may cause degradation of soil quality and negatively impact plant growth and the health of various organisms, leading to an overall decline in biodiversity. Water pollution is another concern when old sandwich wrappers are tossed into rivers, lakes, or oceans. The wrappers may contain toxins or pollutants that can contaminate the water, which, in turn, affects marine life and bioaccumulates in the food chain. Additionally, the wrappers may contribute to the growing issue of plastic pollution in our oceans. Many sandwich wrappers are made from plastics or materials with plastic components, which take a long time to break down and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, posing a constant threat to marine life. Furthermore, improperly disposing of old sandwich wrappers can exacerbate the problem of overflowing landfills. Since many sandwich wrappers are non-biodegradable or take an extended period to decompose, they can occupy valuable space in landfills, which are already limited in capacity. This can lead to a higher demand for new landfill sites, which may require deforestation or the destruction of natural habitats—both pressing issues with their adverse environmental impacts. To minimize the damage caused by old sandwich wrappers and other waste materials, individuals should practice proper waste management techniques, such as recycling, composting, and responsibly disposing of garbage. As a society, we can also advocate for more environmentally friendly packaging materials and waste reduction initiatives to ensure a healthier and cleaner environment for all living beings."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Avery Bullard (Raoul Freeman), President of Tredway Corporation, concludes a meeting with his investment banker, Julius Steigel (Edgar Stehli), in Steigel's Wall Street office.

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled.

Context: For a month, anything I consumed would result in me rushing to the wash room and throwing up. When this started, I thought it’s something to do with what I had previously eaten which was stale and was having a reaction to bad food. When the problem persisted for a week where I was barely able to keep my food from coming out, I went to visit my doctor. He asked me questions and gave me some vitamins and pills before and after food to stop the vomiting. They didn’t work. Even though I was not sexually active, I got my self a pregnancy test which showed negitive. I tried to eat healthy, but to no avail. 15 mins was the max my food was inside my stomach. I was becoming weak from all the throwing up and rapidly loosing weight. I went to my doctor again and he said I was stressed. Wrote me some more pills. Nothing worked. My Mom got paranoid and took me to another doctor for a second opinion. The doctor asked me to write down everything I ate with the number of times I threw up for the next 2 days and return to his clinic. Only then, were they able to diagnose that I was lactose intolerant!! Milk, milk products, cheese, butter, cream, nothing seems to agree with my stomach anymore. Surprisingly this is what I used to eat - cereals with milk, eggs with butter, pizza, pasta, lasagne, cheese with bread, tall long glasses of iced coffee, frappes and bam, my body would reject them within 15 minutes. It was terrible switching from coffee with milk to black coffee, until I started developing a taste for it. Pizza’s are something I still can’t eat. I need to remove the cheese from the slice and unfortunately my body is able to only take one slice of Pizza. Pasta, white sauce is a strict no no unless I want to feel bloated and throw up. So yep.

Archaeologists believe the women may have been sacrificed as many as 4,000 years ago, perhaps as part of \\"foundation ceremonies\\" that were held before the construction of the neolithic stone city commenced. The women's skulls were buried without their bodies, and many had indications that they were \\"hit and burned,\\" per one archaeologist. The South China Morning Post reports that it's not the first sign of human sacrifice in ancient China, where servants and concubines often joined kings and emperors in their graves—sometimes killed first, sometimes buried alive. The find occurred in Shaanxi province's Shimao Ruins, which were themselves discovered in 1976 and continue to turn up big finds: Archaeologists last week announced that they had uncovered the ruins of two beacon towers there, per the Xinhua news agency. Expand this summary.","completion":"A recent archaeological discovery in China has unearthed a mass grave containing the skulls of 80 young women, thought to be around 4,000 years old, as per state media reports. Researchers believe these women may have been victims of human sacrifice, potentially related to \\"foundation ceremonies\\" carried out prior to the construction of a neolithic stone city. The women's skulls were found to have been buried without their bodies, and many showed signs that they had been \\"hit and burned.\\" The finding, located in Shaanxi province's Shimao Ruins, highlights the prevalence of human sacrifice in ancient Chinese culture, often involving servants and concubines being buried alongside emperors and kings, either having been killed beforehand or sometimes buried alive. The phenomenon of human sacrifice was deeply ingrained in Chinese society through cultural beliefs, practices, and rituals, making it an important aspect of historical research for archaeologists examining this period. The Shimao Ruins, where this discovery was made, were initially discovered in 1976 but have continued to provide valuable archaeological findings since then. Recently, the ruins of two beacon towers have also been uncovered in the same area, according to Xinhua news agency. As the excavations continue, the site provides critical insights into ancient Chinese societal practices, infrastructure, and the intricacies of life during that era. The discovery of the mass grave holding the skulls of young women offers a unique opportunity for scholars to delve deeper into the concept of human sacrifice within ancient Chinese culture. By examining the motives and rituals behind such practices, future research can better understand the relationships between power, religion, and the value of human life in this historical context. Furthermore, this finding also allows scholars to explore the role women played in these ancient societies—in particular, the significance behind the selection of female individuals for such sacrificial ceremonies. It raises questions about the selection process, the societal status of these women, and the cultural symbolism surrounding them at the time. Not only does the discovery shed light on the prevalence of human sacrifice in China, but it also contributes to the broader understanding of similar practices across ancient civilizations. Undoubtedly, it encourages further multiregional comparative analysis regarding sacrificial customs and the function of ritualistic acts in shaping these early societies. In conclusion, the unearthing of the mass grave holding the skulls of 80 young women in China provides a stark reminder of the macabre practices of human sacrifice in ancient times. While the reasons behind these rituals can be challenging to comprehend from a contemporary standpoint, continued excavations of historical sites like the Shimao Ruins significantly enhances our understanding of ancient civilizations and their complex social structures. This contributes to a more comprehensive and empathetic apprehension of the past, shaping our knowledge of human history and the evolution of cultural practices over millennia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\"? The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person that James H.

Write highlights for this article: Over two-thirds of Britons believe the Â£9 billion (13.8 billion) bill for the London Olympics was worth it, but economists and business leaders argue it could take years to see the economic benefits. According to a poll by research consultancy ComRes, released on the first anniversary of the Games, 69% of participants said it was a good investment of public money. But only 22% of the public feel the Games have had a positive impact on the local economy in their area, with 67% saying the Olympics had no impact at all. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit. He told CNN: \\"I think there are question marks over whether the Â£10 billion of public money spent on the games could have been better used... for example infrastructure projects such as transport, that could have yielded a higher economic return.\\" In the second-quarter of 2013, the U.K. grew by 0.6% -- double the rate of expansion for the first three months of the year -- suggesting Europe's third-largest economy is on track for a recovery. Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years. The UK contracted for five consecutive quarters from the second quarter of 2008, and failed to grow for another nine months in late 2011 and early 2012 as the eurozone debt crisis raged. Although the cultural heritage of the Olympics is important, it could take years before we see its true economic value, according to Tombs. He said: \\"You often fail to see a boost in tourism for the years after the Games and obviously it's very hard to reuse the facilities that have been built.\\" Director of Economics at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mark Ambler, said the benefits may not be evident for at least another 10 years. He told CNN: \\"On this basis, the evidence I have been involved in generating and that I have seen from others suggests strongly that the UK will get a good return on its investment, although I think important parts of it are still to come.\\" Investment boost. On Thursday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the success of the Olympics and Paralympics has spurred investment in the U.K capital. Speaking at a press conference, he said: \\"Remember the fate of the Olympo-sceptics is all I would say to anyone tempted to doubt the legacy.\\" But according to Matthew Jaffa, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, not enough is being done in the wake of the Olympics to promote \\"Brand London\\" as an exporter. He added: \\"The Games have had more of an impact on London than the rest of the UK. 55% of the companies that won contracts, directly related to the Olympics, saw growth within the turnover of their business, which is positive.\\" Despite skepticism from some quarters of the business community, the ComRes poll -- which surveyed over 3,200 people -- also showed that nearly three-quarters of Britons would welcome the Olympic Games back given the opportunity. Andrew Simms, political economist and and co-author of the book 'London 2012 - How Was it For Us?' said the Games were \\"a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do.\\"","completion":"Over two-thirds of Britons believe the £9 billion (13.8 billion) bill for the London Olympics was worth it, according to a poll by research consultancy ComRes.

Fact 2: Asexual reproduction gives offspring similar to parents. Given the two facts above, alternation of generations allows for different methods of producing:? A:","completion":"Given the two facts above, alternation of generations allows for different methods of producing offspring. Step-by-step justification: 1. Fact 1 states that alternation of generations allows for both asexual and sexual reproduction. This means that a species with an alternation of generations life cycle can reproduce in two different ways. 2. Fact 2 states that asexual reproduction gives offspring similar to the parents. This implies that in asexual reproduction, there is little genetic variation among the offspring and their parents, leading to offspring with similar characteristics. 3. We know from Fact 1 that sexual reproduction is also an option in alternation of generations. Sexual reproduction results in greater genetic variation among offspring due to the recombination of genetic material from both parents. 4.

After watching a charity program on TV and listening to her school teachers talk about kindness and generosity, she decided to turn a new leaf and make a change.

She gathered her beloved crystal-covered Audi toy car worth £1,500, crystal and jewel-encrusted outfits, and even her precious crown worth £80, and set them up for auction. The money raised from the auction would go directly to a charity that supports underprivileged children, helping them receive basic necessities, education, and opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have access to.

However, seeing the determination and sincerity in her young child's eyes, Lisa couldn't help but feel proud of the empathetic and compassionate person Lacie was growing into.

Question: I have a new situation: Beth and Sally are both on the high school basketball team and are about to play a match against their rival school. This match is extremely important, and students from both schools always turn out in droves to support their team. Last year, Beth and Sally's team lost so they are extra motivated this year to win. Before the game, Beth spends her time running in place and doing jumping jacks to prepare, and Sally spends her time talking to her friends who are sitting in the bleachers cheering the team on. But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Are Sally's muscles more or less ready for the game than Beth's? Answer:","completion":"Sally's muscles are likely less ready for the game than Beth's. This is because Beth spends her time before the game doing warm-up exercises like running in place and doing jumping jacks, which gradually increase the intensity of physical activity and prepare her muscles for the game. Warming up has several benefits, including increased blood flow to the muscles, increased heart rate, and decreased likelihood of muscle and tendon injuries. On the other hand, Sally spends her time talking to her friends in the bleachers, and it appears that she isn't engaging in any warm-up activity. This means that her muscles may not be prepared for the sudden increase in physical activity during the game. As a result, Sally's muscles are less ready for the game than Beth's, and she may be at a higher risk of injury due to the lack of proper warm-up."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: One of my longest-running battles with my kids is about manners specifically,about whether it's necessary to send hand-written thank-you notes for gifts.I say yes,and my children have continued throughout their teens to write the notes.But they grumble that I'm out of step with the times. If a new BabyCenter poll is any guide, _ .A surprisingly large number of parents still insist that their children practice such old-fashioned manners as putting pen-to-paper to say thank you,treating adults with respect and addressing adults as \\"Mr., Mrs.or Miss.\\"A majority of the 1,000 parents surveyed also said they insist at dinner that children keep napkins in their laps,ask to be excused from the table and refrain from talking with a full mouth. Among the reasons cited most often by parents,BabyCenter says,is that \\"the world is a more free-wheeling place,and they want to give their kids a stronger moral compass to guide them.\\"This thinking was affirmed by 64%of those surveyed.And 58%say they see so many badly behaved kids around them that they're determined to raise their children differently.

M.I.A. promoted the album with a series of appearances at music festivals, including the Hard festival in New York and The Big Chill in Herefordshire.

Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from grade 1st to 6th-grade will be considered as in elementary school, and 7th to 12th-grade kids will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs, i.e., elementary and high.

High school students tend to have a more advanced vocabulary, better control over grammatical structures, and they are generally capable of producing works with deeper themes and more complex expressions. In this poem, the consistent use of the verb \\"be\\" instead of \\"are\\" or \\"is\\", misspellings like \\"small\\" instead of \\"smell\\", \\"fell\\" instead of \\"feel\\", \\"hart\\" instead of \\"heart\\", \\"weel\\" instead of \\"will\\", suggest that the writer is likely still in the process of mastering basic English language skills common for elementary aged children. Additionally, the theme of the poem focuses on a child's appreciation for their mother and a wish to take care of her, a sentiment that's quite common among younger children. The recurring simplistic expressions of love and admiration (\\"you be the number one mom\\", \\"I love you with all my hart\\", \\"you make me fell safe\\") further reinforce the notion that the poem was probably written by an elementary school student. However, keep in mind that without more information, such as the age of the child when they wrote the poem or their educational background, this prediction may not be 100% accurate. It's also important to remember that students learn and develop at different rates and the quality of a child's writing can vary widely depending on many factors, including but not limited to, their reading habits, educational support, and their natural aptitude for language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\", can you guess it ?

He joins the Coast Guard, partly by chance due to the flip of a coin. After boot training, Al is assigned to a buoy tender in Boston, the Periwinkle, as a ship's cook although he has no cooking experience. He encounters immediate hostility from the chief of the galley, Red Wildoe, from new crew mates and cooks' helpers Gutsell and Poznicki, and from his arrogant department head, Lieutenant (junior grade) Higgins. In a Boston bar, Al picks up Stella, who appears to do this kind of thing with some regularity. They develop a strong attraction, but she seems to be holding out for something more.[3] He befriends Gutsell by fixing him up with a girlfriend of Stella's and learns from Wildoe how to be a ship's cook, making a number of embarrassing mistakes. Al, frustrated after Stella won't spend a night in a hotel room with him, stops seeing her, whereupon he and the alcoholic Wildoe get drunk together and bond. Wildoe begins seeing Stella with Al's blessing. Pearl Harbor is attacked and war declared. Wildoe abruptly proposes to Stella and they marry. A free-for-all breaks out at their wedding celebration, with a jealous Al instigating a fight with soldiers who are clearly familiar with Stella already. Wildoe is assigned to another vessel performing convoy duty at sea. During this time, Stella begins seeing other men. Al tries to prevent this on Wildoe's behalf, but can't resist Stella himself.

OPT: [a]. memory; [b]. the theme of listening material; [c]. a branch of knowledge studied; [d]. the student experimented on; Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory.

Step 1: Identify the symptoms Symptoms mentioned in the questions include: - Ear pain while swallowing - Sore throat - Cough Step 2: Research causes of these symptoms - Ear pain while swallowing: This can be caused by a middle ear infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, or inflammation in the throat, which is connected to the ear via Eustachian tubes. - Sore throat: Common causes include viral infections (like the common cold or the flu), bacterial infections (like strep throat), or irritation due to environmental factors. - Cough: Coughs can be caused by several factors, including cold, flu, allergies, bronchitis, and infections in the upper respiratory tract. Step 3: Identify possible connections Both ear pain while swallowing and sore throat can be symptoms of a common cold or flu, or they can result from infections or inflammation in the throat or ears. A cough can also be a symptom of a cold, flu, or upper respiratory tract infection. It is important to note that these symptoms might have different causes and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Question 1 answer: Ear pain while swallowing with a sore throat can be caused by middle ear infections, eustachian tube dysfunction, or inflammation in the throat. Question 2 answer: Having a sore throat with cough and ear pain can mean the person is experiencing symptoms of a common cold, flu, or an infection in the upper respiratory tract. It might also indicate a separate issue with the ear or throat that may or may not be related to the cough and sore throat. Now, let's compare the two questions: Question 1 focuses on the cause of ear pain while swallowing with a sore throat. Question 2 aims to understand the meaning behind the combination of symptoms: sore throat, cough, and ear pain. Both questions address similar issues, but they are not the same. Question 1 is more specific in examining the cause of ear pain while swallowing, while Question 2 encompasses more symptoms and looks to find a broader meaning for the combination of symptoms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you communicate with your horse, it is important to remain calm. If you don’t come in knowing what you want to do, you will likely fall back on feelings and instincts. This will make you more likely to panic or overreact to a horse’s actions, rather than remaining calm and in control. When you come near a horse, you want to make sure he is willing to talk to you. If the horse wants to talk to you, he will turn his head or front toward your, lick his lips, and soften his eyes. Once you get this signal, you can approach the horse slowly and start communicating further. Your horse may do the opposite, turning his head away from you, walking away, or even ignoring you. If the horse isn’t interested in letting you in, he won’t be responsive to what you say. Horses have monocular vision, meaning they can’t see directly in front of their noses. Make sure you walk toward a horse from the side so he can see you clearly. Never approach a horse from behind. Horses can’t see in that direction, and you are at risk of getting kicked if they get spooked. Make sure your horse recognizes that you are the leader of his herd. If he doesn’t recognize you that way, he won’t listen to what you are saying. If your horse doesn’t seem to be showing proper respect, make him move his feet. Pushing on his shoulder or hip should do well on most occasions. If you need a little more power, you can poke him with the handle end of a crop. Just make sure you stand in the same place when you do this, and don’t shuffle your feet. A horse that doesn’t respect you will rub his head on you, nip to get your attention, or walk in front of you when you are trying to lead him. These are not behaviors he would show to a dominant leader of his herd. Horses are prey animals, meaning that in the wild they are hunted by others, and your horse considers you a predator. This means he will consider any outsider to be a threat, including you. Learn to approach the horses calmly so they regard you as someone walking through the herd rather than a potential predator.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of remaining calm and establishing leadership while communicating with horses, ensuring they perceive you as a non-threatening figure and demonstrating proper techniques for approaching and interacting with them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ethan Liptonâs âNo Place to Go,â at Joeâs Pub Ethan Lipton, a wry singer-songwriter whose heavy-lidded affability and retro facial hair make him look like a doomed sidekick in a ’70s cop movie, grinned upon learning that one collaborator after another had independently used the word Everyman to describe him. “Here, and I thought I was fancy,” he said. For nearly four weeks, beginning on Wednesday, audiences at Joe’s Pub can decide for themselves. There Mr. Lipton will meld his three professional personas — troubadour, playwright and permalance office drone — into “No Place to Go,” which converts the current economic malaise into a chipper-despite-it-all song cycle that Woody Guthrie and Ben Folds might both embrace. “No Place to Go,” directed by Leigh Silverman, features Mr. Lipton and his three-piece band in a somewhat staged production that hews very closely to its creator’s recent experiences. Like his unnamed protagonist, Mr. Lipton, 41, pays his rent predominantly through freelance jobs in publishing. (He describes himself in the show as an “information refiner.”) In both cases, the issue of relocating to keep your job arises when an employer decides to leave New York, although only the onstage Mr. Lipton is faced with a relocation to Mars, where “the real estate is, like, a penny a hectare.” Looming over “No Place” is the broader issue of how to be an artist when “we are all now, on this planet, accountable to the shareholders.” Mr. Lipton, who experienced the unhip phenomenon of actually liking his day job, chose to stay put. Luckily, Joe’s Pub came calling with a commission, thanks to a National Endowment for the Arts grant to develop pieces with “musicians who had strong narrative in their work,” according to Shanta Thake, the club’s director. Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater in the East Village, chose five musicians with a connection to the club; the others were Angelique Kidjo, Allen Toussaint, Toshi Reagon and Lady Rizo. Their pieces are at various stages of development, Ms. Thake said, and Joe’s Pub has no firm plans to produce them. Mr. Lipton was a particularly apt choice, as he had also participated in the Public’s Emerging Writers Group, where he had collaborated with Ms. Silverman, a popular Off Broadway director whose Broadway ventures include “Chinglish” and “Well.” He had already been considering some sort of project along these lines; there’s a Post-it Note kicking around from a few months back on which he had written “Musical about losing my job (or album).” But the commission allowed him to conjoin two realms that had thus far been segregated: his music and his plays, which have been performed at Here Arts Center in the South Village and as part of Clubbed Thumb’s Summerworks festival. “I had toyed with the idea of doing things like this before,” said Mr. Lipton, who has also dabbled in acting. (He was in the original cast of Elevator Repair Service’s celebrated play “Gatz,” which returns to the Public the same night as “No Place to Go” begins performances.) “But playwriting is such a willful act, whereas songwriting is kind of an escape from that. Each gives me a bit of protection from the other.” Ms. Silverman said this combination was a long time coming. “People leave his shows whipped into this sort of ecstasy” by the music and by his quirky way of delivering it, she said. Mr. Lipton’s music is sort of a sliced-and-diced Great American Songbook. “The thing we lean back into is a kind of jazz-folk-Americana idiom,” Mr. Lipton said of his band, known as Ethan Lipton and His Orchestra, “but we also try to push forward into something that sounds contemporary lyrically and also isn’t too dinosaury sound-wise.” And so “No Place to Go” features a jaunty tribute to the New Deal-era’s job-creation effort, the W.P.A., but also pokes fun at the working man’s propensity to, when facing financial ruin, “make another macho move in Scrabble” and “see if there’s anything about it on The Huffington Post.” Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public, played a central role in shepherding “No Place” into production less than a year after it was commissioned, partly because it was so topical and partly because Mr. Lipton’s outlook runs counter to most topical fare. “That modest, offhand, slightly wry way Ethan looks at himself and the world around him is a wonderful antidote to the partisan hysteria — and I say this as a partisan hysteric — about anything political, and especially anything economic, today,” Mr. Eustis said. Modest, offhand, wry: These are not words you typically use when describing a bandleader. (Matt Berninger, the lead singer of the rock band the National and another longtime fan, threw “subtle” and “charming” into the mix.) “Like most artists — like most people, I guess — I started out when I was younger, trying to figure out what was special or different or original,” Mr. Lipton said. “And at some point I realized it was more interesting to me — and a bigger challenge — to try to look at what’s the same, or what’s common about our experiences. “I’m a grown-up,” he continued. “I’ve been working. And I and the people I know have mostly managed to do that with dignity. And it’s not because we’re mature or good people. It’s because we’ve got to work.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Ethan Lipton is a singer-songwriter who has a show called \\"No Place to Go\\" at Joe's Pub. In the show, he combines his experiences as a musician, playwright, and freelancer. The show is about the challenges of being an artist and working in the modern economy.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. When his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the Wilber Sweatman Orchestra in New York City, Ellington made the fateful decision to leave behind his successful career in Washington, D.C., and move to Harlem, ultimately becoming part of the Harlem Renaissance. New dance crazes such as the Charleston emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American musical theater, including Eubie Blake's Shuffle Along. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive and hard to crack. They hustled pool by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at rent-house parties for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged. In June 1923, a gig in Atlantic City, New Jersey, led to a play date at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club - 49th and Broadway - and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter James \\"Bubber\\" Miley. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club). Ellington made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \\"Choo Choo\\". In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to Chocolate Kiddies starring Lottie Gee and Adelaide Hall, an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington's arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and sultry saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet played with them, imparting his propulsive swing and superior musicianship to the young band members.

What is the subject line for this email? As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk. To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the \\"Operational Risk Committee\\"), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson. Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped. It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk. The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk. Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now. It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements. A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda. These include: Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement. This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk. Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR. Work with GRMO to develop \\"rules of use\\" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet \\"books\\" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Two women have now passed the Army's grueling Ranger test, and even tougher and more dangerous jobs could lie ahead. The military services are poised to allow women to serve in most front-line combat jobs, including special operations forces, senior officials told The Associated Press. RETRANSMISSION TO REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO THE ARMY RANGERS. THESE WOMEN ARE NOT TRAINING IN THE RANGERS PROGRAM - FILE - In this Aug. 13, 2013 file photo, U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms Third Class Danielle... (Associated Press) Based on early talks, officials say the Army, Navy and Air Force likely will not seek exceptions that close any jobs to women. Marine Corps leaders, they say, have expressed concerns about allowing women to serve in infantry jobs and yet may seek an exception. The services are wrapping up reviews and must make their recommendations to Defense Secretary Ash Carter this fall. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the internal debate. Even if Marine leaders object, they are likely to meet resistance from senior Navy and Defense Department officials who want the military to be united on this issue. Undercutting the Marines' reservations is that Special Operations Command is likely to allow women to compete for the most demanding military commando jobs — including the Navy SEALs and the Army's Delta Force — though with the knowledge that it may be years before women even try to enter those fields. Women have been steadily moving into previously all-male jobs across the military, including as members of the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, best known as the helicopter crews that flew Navy SEALs into Osama bin Laden's compound. Women are also now serving on Navy submarines and in Army artillery units. Friday will mark another milestone as the two women graduate at Fort Benning, Georgia, from the Ranger school, a physically and mentally demanding two-month combat leadership course. Completing the course lets the two women wear the coveted Ranger black-and-gold tab, but it does not let them become members of the Ranger regiment. Neither woman has been publicly identified by the military. Longer term, the uncertainty of the Marine decision underscores the wrenching debates going on within the military over the changing role of women, and it reflects the individual identities of the services and how they view their warrior ethos. Only a handful of jobs in the Navy and Air Force are currently closed to women. Last year the Navy considered seeking an exception that would have prohibited women from serving on older guided missile frigates, mine-countermeasure ships and patrol coast craft. Some argued that those ships, which are due to be phased out in coming years, would need millions of dollars in construction to add facilities for women and it wasn't worth the expense. But Navy Secretary Ray Mabus withdrew that plan in a memo late last month that was obtained by the AP. Officials said Navy leaders concluded that since women can serve in all the same jobs on other ships no real exclusion existed. The Army and Marine Corps, however, have thousands of infantry, artillery and armor jobs that are currently closed to women. There has been a lot of study and debate over whether to open those positions, because they often involve fighting in small units on the front lines, doing physically punishing tasks. The Marine Corps set up a task force this year to set gender-neutral job standards and determine whether incorporating women into small squads affected unit cohesion or combat readiness. Companies made up of all men and mixes of men and women spent up to three months in California performing a broad range of unit tasks and going through detailed scientific evaluations to see how they did. Senior leaders are reviewing those results. Army leaders did similar scientific analysis, reviewing all tasks needed to do the combat jobs and have been creating gender-neutral standards that troops will have to meet in order to qualify. Meanwhile, however, the Army began to slowly open some combat positions, including artillery jobs, to women. In recent days, officials familiar with the discussions said they believe the Army will allow women to seek infantry and armor jobs as well. Gen. Ray Odierno, who retired last week as Army chief of staff, hinted at that conclusion. \\"In order to best manage your talent, you have to pick the best people who can perform to the standards that we have established,\\" Odierno said. \\"If you can meet the standards that we've established, then you should be able to perform in that (position). And I think that's where we're headed.\\" In January 2013 then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey signed an order wiping away generations of limits on women fighting for their country, ordering a quarter-million positions open regardless of gender. They called for sweeping reviews of the physical requirements for combat jobs and gave the military services until January 2016 to argue if any positions should remain closed to women. Throughout the process, all the services have made it clear they will not reduce any standards to allow women to qualify for the most demanding jobs. But they reviewed the requirements for the various combat posts to make sure they were directly related to tasks that had to be done as part of the jobs. During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, thousands of women served and fought, and about 160 died. Dempsey told reporters during that 2013 news conference that he did not rule out women serving as members of special operations forces, although it might be years before they actually qualified. \\"I think we all believe that there will be women who can meet those standards,\\" he said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This article talks about how women are allowed to do more jobs in the military. There were some jobs that only men could do before, but now women can do them too. Some examples are being part of the Army Rangers, flying helicopters, and working on submarines. There is still some disagreement about whether women should do certain jobs, like being in the infantry, but many people think that as long as they can do the tasks required for the job, women should be allowed to do those jobs too.

Article: For many students in the UK today, deciding whether or not to go to university can be as much about affordability as it is about ambition and aspiration. In the past, students in the UK could apply to a university or college. They were sure that even if they came from a low income family, their tuition fees and some of their living (or maintenance) costs would be covered by a local authority grant . A university education was, in a financial sense, open to all and the number of students attending university grew yearly. Sadly, it seems, those days are long gone. The turning point came in 1998, when the Labour Government introduced tuition fees of PS1,000 a year and, instead of giving students a maintenance grant, asked them to cover their own living expenses with a repayable student loan. Only students on the lowest incomes were entitled to a grant. The flood gates had been opened. As time passed, the ceiling on tuition fees rose, and although applicants from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales still qualified for varying levels of subsidy , by 2009/10 students in England often found themselves facing tuition fees overPS3,000 a year. In 2011 the Government announced that, from 2012, universities could charge fees of up to PS9,000 a year. Although the Government by stating that postgraduates did not have to begin repaying their student loans until they were earning more than PS21,000 a year, the news created over-dissatisfaction. Many students argued that it was unfair that students should have to begin their work life loaded with huge debt, while others complained that the changes would bring back a class divide to university education. These views were reflected in the number of students applying for a university place, which by January 2012 fell by more than 22,000. The Universities Minister, David Willetts, stood by the decision to increase tuition fees, saying that they would not \\"put universities' finance on a bearable footing\\" and that they would accelerate \\"a stronger focus on high quality teaching.\\" Question: We can put the sentence \\"But the biggest change was still to come\\" at the beginning of Paragraph _ .

Over the course of the series, Apollo and Rocky develop a deep friendship and mutual respect, with Apollo even becoming a mentor to Rocky in later films. Apollo Creed's death occurred in the fourth installment of the series, \\"Rocky IV,\\" which was released in 1985. In the film, a formidable and seemingly invincible Russian boxer named Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lundgren) challenges American fighters to prove the superiority of the Soviet Union's sports program. Apollo Creed, seeking to regain his glory days and defend his country's honor, accepts the challenge and sets up an exhibition match against the formidable Drago. The match takes place and quickly turns out to be a monumental mismatch. Despite Rocky's pleas to call off the fight, a determined Apollo insists on continuing, but the overpowered Drago ultimately lands a lethal punch. Apollo collapses to the canvas, suffering severe internal and brain injuries, and tragically dies in Rocky's arms in the ring. Apollo Creed's death serves as a significant plot point in the \\"Rocky\\" series, as it sets the stage for Rocky to seek revenge against Drago and restore his friend's honor by defeating him in a subsequent match.

Solve this problem.","completion":"To solve the equation -16 = 71*t + 55 for t, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (t) on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to move the constant term (+55) to the other side of the equation. Since the constant term is positive, we will subtract 55 from both sides to keep the equation balanced. -16 = 71*t + 55 -16 - 55 = 71*t + 55 - 55 This simplifies to: -71 = 71*t Step 2: Solve for the variable t. Now, we need to isolate t by dividing both sides of the equation by 71. This will help us find the value of t. -71 = 71*t -71 / 71 = (71*t) / 71 This simplifies to: -1 = t So, the value of t that solves the equation -16 = 71*t + 55 is: t = -1"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A U.S. congressional delegation will meet for talks with Cuban officials on Monday in the highest-level contact between the two nations since plans for trade reforms were announced. The symbolic meeting between the U.S. delegation and its old cold war foe will be led by Senator Patrick Leahy and could be attended by President Raul Castro. U.S. delegates are set to tell Cuban officials that their actions in the coming months will influence Congressional openness to President Barack Obama's plans.

Both of these steps require congressional approval, and many lawmakers, particularly Republicans, remain skeptical of the Cuban government's commitment to democratic reforms and human rights improvements. The six-member bipartisan delegation, which also includes Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, will discuss opportunities for increased cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, and tourism. Additionally, they will bring up concerns regarding human rights and political freedoms in Cuba. During the meeting, Cuban officials are expected to present their perspective on the current political climate, economic reforms underway, and their commitment to improving relations with the United States. They will also likely address the need for the U.S. to lift the embargo to fully realize the benefits of normalized relations. Both sides are anticipated to explore confidence-building measures, such as collaboration on disaster response and battling drug trafficking, to demonstrate goodwill and mutual trust moving forward. These measures could help persuade reluctant lawmakers to support Obama's proposed changes in U.S.-Cuba relations. In conclusion, following the high-level talks between the U.S. congressional delegation and Cuban officials, a clearer picture will emerge regarding the potential for bilateral relations and the likelihood of Congress removing some restrictive measures. As each side presents its concerns and expectations, progress can be measured by the level of constructive dialogue and willingness to address key issues. In the coming months, concrete actions from the Cuban government will be crucial in determining the pace of continued engagement and the possibility of legislative changes in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I want to plant vegetables in my garden and decided against corn and chose to plant squash instead because the","completion":"climate in my region is more suitable for squash growth. Squash plants, unlike corn, can tolerate a wider range of temperatures and soil conditions, making them a more versatile and resilient option for my garden. Step 1: Research squash varieties Before I begin planting, I will research different squash varieties to determine which ones are best suited for my specific region and garden conditions. Factors such as sunlight, soil type, and climate will all play a role in my decision. Step 2: Choose the right time for planting Timing is crucial when planting squash, as it is sensitive to frost. I will consult my local planting calendar and track the weather forecast to determine the optimal time for planting to ensure a successful harvest. Step 3: Prepare the soil Preparing the soil is a critical step in the process, as squash plants thrive in well-draining soil with plenty of organic matter. I will turn the soil and mix in compost to improve drainage, aeration, and nutrient availability. Additionally, I will test the pH level of the soil, targeting a slightly acidic to neutral pH range of 6.0-7.0 for optimal squash growth. Step 4: Plant the seeds or seedlings Based on my research, I will decide whether to plant seeds or seedlings. If planting seeds, I will sow the seeds about 1 inch deep and 3 feet apart in rows or hills (mounds of soil), depending on my garden layout. If planting seedlings, I will transplant them carefully, keeping the same spacing as recommended for seeds. Step 5: Water and care for the plants During the initial stages of plant growth, I will provide consistent moisture, watering about 1-1.5 inches per week, depending on rainfall and weather conditions. As the plants grow, I will also monitor them for disease and pests and take appropriate measures to protect my plants. Step 6: Fertilize as needed Although squash plants benefit from the compost mixed into the soil, additional fertilizer may be necessary, especially if the soil is lacking in nutrients. Following the recommended rates, I will apply an all-purpose organic fertilizer during the growing season to ensure my plants have adequate nourishment. Step 7: Harvest at the right time The final step in the process is harvesting my squash at the right time. Depending on the variety, squash plants can take anywhere from 40-100 days to reach maturity. I will monitor my plants for signs of ripeness, such as a developed color, firm skin, and ideal size, before harvesting and enjoying my homegrown squash."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This implies that the sick person is experiencing symptoms and is not receiving medical care or intervention.

The author demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of reciprocity – a principle that is central to many moral and ethical systems. 'Give more take less' communicates a philosophy of generosity, selflessness, and a focus on contributing to others or the world more than we take from it; it suggests opting for altruism over personal gain. Given its comparison with 'the wildest of jungles,' this sentiment is accentuated. Jungles often symbolize chaos, struggle for survival, and unpredictability in popular culture. When the author suggests this principle applies effectively even in such challenging circumstances, they underline the timelessness and universal nature of the principle. It's their belief that even in the most adverse situations, a spirit of giving and general benevolence can prevail. The choice of informal language ('Wad up Homie') following such a profound statement can indicate a couple of things. Firstly, it could mean the author does not take themselves too seriously, even while discussing serious philosophical principles. It can also mean that despite holding such principles in high esteem, the author believes in making them accessible and relatable, avoiding overly formal or academic language. Overall, this tweet's sentiment underscores a strong sense of morality grounded in selflessness, implications of universal applicability, all wrapped in colloquial and accessible language.

The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) was set up to deal with toxic loans after the 2008 property crash. Cerberus bought Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio for £1.3bn in 2014. The Republic of Ireland's auditor general has concluded that there were shortcomings in the sale process, costing taxpayers up to £190m.

Cerberus declined to give oral evidence to a Stormont inquiry, citing a a variety of legal reasons; however it did give written evidence. Cerberus does big deals but is not a outfit which welcomes big headlines. In 2008, when it had a high profile involvement with the Chrysler car company, it wrote to investors apologising, saying: \\"We despise all the public attention we are getting.\\" The firm's founder, Stephen Feinberg, reportedly joked that if anyone at Cerberus gets their picture in the paper, \\"we will do more than fire that person - we will kill him.\\" So it's significant that the fund is wheeling out one of its top team to deal with the Nama issue - a story which has now been running for more than a year. Mr Neporent is likely to face questions about the Cerberus relationship with two law firms - Brown Rudnick and Tughans. The firms had been representing another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio. Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor. Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms \\"a success fee only basis\\", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done. Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans.

Stenkil probably originated from Västergötland. - Emund the Old or Edmund (Swedish: \\"Emund den gamle\\", Old Swedish: \\"Æmunðær gamlæ\\", \\"Æmunðær gammal\\", \\"Æmunðær slemæ\\") was King of Sweden from 1050 to 1060. - Uppsala (older spelling \\"Upsala\\") is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth largest city of Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. It had 140,454 inhabitants in 2010. - Halsten Stenkilsson , English exonym : Alstan ( Old Icelandic : Hallstein ) was a king of Sweden , son of King Stenkil and a Swedish princess . He became king after his father Stenkil 's death ( 1066 ) , and he may have ruled together with his brother Inge the Elder . The date of his death is not known . Little is known of his time as king . In a scholia in the work of Adam of Bremen , he is reported to have been elected king after the death of two pretenders , but deposed after a short while . That he ruled together with his brother Inge has some support from a papal letter from 1081 , by Pope Gregory VII , which refers to two kings with the initials A and I , and where they are called kings of Västergötland ( rege wisigothorum ) . However , the king \`\` A '' could also be Håkan the Red . His co-rulership with his brother Inge is also mentioned in the Hervarar saga . In the regnal list of the Westrogothic law , he is said to have been courteous and cheerful , and whenever a case was submitted to him , he judged fairly , and this was why Sweden mourned his death . He was the father of the co-rulers Philip and Inge the Younger . The Hervarar saga , which is one of the few sources about the kings of this time , has the following to tell : - Stenkil (Old Norse: Steinkell) was a King of Sweden who ruled c. 1060 until 1066. He succeeded Emund the Old and became the first king from the House of Stenkil. He was not from Uppsala, but probably from Västergötland and related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund's daughter. - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden.

If your comic is in flawless or nearly flawless condition, it might merit a grade of \\"mint\\" or \\"near mint.\\" This condition applies to perfectly flat comics with supple paper, a glossy cover, and no obvious wear. \\"Mint\\" grades include \\"Perfect/Gem Mint\\" (10.0) and \\"Mint\\" (9.9). These describe comics that have no detectable imperfections. A 10.0 book is absolutely perfect in every way. Very few comics meet this criteria, even those still sitting on the shelves in a comic store. \\"Near Mint+/Mint\\" grades include \\"Near Mint/Mint\\" (9.8) and \\"Near Mint+\\" (9.6). These grades describe comics that have only the slightest wear. A small number of stress lines and very slight discoloration are acceptable defects. Most people would consider these to be perfect, but the trained eye may notice tiny imperfections. \\"Near Mint\\" (9.4) and \\"Near Mint-\\" (9.2) describe comics that have minimal stress lines and discoloration. The spine and cover are flat. The cover may have a small amount of surface wear, but the colors are still bright. A 9.4 Near Mint book is the standard condition of a new book sold at a comic store as is considered \\"new\\" condition. A 9.2 indicates only the very minor wear, typically a minimal stress mark on the spine (non-color breaking) or other similar marks. A comic which is well preserved but not \\"mint\\" is typically described as \\"Fine\\" or \\"Very Fine.\\" These are comics that have been read and enjoyed, but with care. They may have some discoloration, but pages should still be supple and the cover should still be glossy and attractive. \\"Very Fine/Near Mint\\" (9.0), \\"Very Fine+\\" (8.5), \\"Very Fine\\" (8.0), and \\"Very Fine-\\" (7.5) are grades that allow for some wear, as they have typically been read a few times. A few stress lines are acceptable. While the cover can have some wear, it should still retain its original glossiness. \\"Fine\\" grades include \\"Fine/Very Fine\\" (7.0), \\"Fine+\\" (6.5), \\"Fine\\" (6.0), and \\"Fine-\\" (5.5). These grades describe comics with a fair amount of stress lines and creases. A low number of small tears and missing pieces, usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch (about 3.1 to 6.3 mm) in length is also acceptable at this grade level. Below \\"Fine\\" is the grade of \\"Good.\\" This is somewhat deceptive, as a grade of \\"good\\" is actually not particularly good, but more like average. These are comics that have been well-loved by a reader. Still, books in this condition must be intact and readable. \\"Very Good\\" grades include \\"Very Good/Fine\\" (5.0), \\"Very Good+\\" (4.5), \\"Very Good\\" (4.0), and \\"Very Good-\\" (3.5). These grades describe a comic that has all of its pages but is noticeably creased, rolled, and scuffed. Missing pieces on the cover can be as large as 1/4 to 1/2 inch (about 6.3 to 12.5 mm). \\"Good\\" grades include \\"Good/Very Good\\" (3.0), \\"Good+\\" (2.5), \\"Good\\" (2.0), and \\"Good-\\" (1.8). These grades describe comics that are in somewhat worse condition than the \\"Very Good\\" grades. The cover may have some missing pieces and the book is generally scuffed, abraded, and faded. Moderate spine split is permissible. The comic still has all of its pages, however. A \\"Fair\\" condition comic is ragged and unattractive. It may have pieces of pages missing that make the story more difficult to follow (e.g. clipped coupons that cut into panels on the reverse side of the page). \\"Fair\\" grades include \\"Fair/Good\\" (1.5) and \\"Fair\\" (1.0). These grades describe comics that are worn and in general disarray. Despite their condition, they still retain all of the pages and most of the covers. These comics may be torn, stained, faded, and brittle. \\"Poor\\" comics are what the name suggests--heavily damaged. They may be defaced, torn, stained, or have missing chunks. \\"Incomplete\\" comics are those missing covers or pages. \\"Poor\\" (0.5) describes comic books that are missing pages and up to 1/3 of the cover. The comic may be brittle and defaced by other materials such as paint and glue. Some people will not grade a comic missing it's cover, but some give \\"Incomplete\\" comics a score between 0.1 and 0.3. If you have a comic that is extremely rare, you may wish to consider having it graded professionally. This allows you to speak confidently about it's condition in any setting, such as negotiations about pricing. If you plan to have a comic professionally sealed (or \\"slabbed\\"), a professional grading is recommended, since any potential buyers will not be able to open the comic and assess it for themselves.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West's overly indebted and sluggish nations learn from a flourishing Asia? Just a few decades ago, Asia's two giants were stagnating under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, \\"The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.\\" Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan's idea that \\"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. \\"Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to \\"big government.\\" If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine(,), they would begin to see that the America's problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country's huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create motivations for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less...

Answer the following question: Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal. Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Answer:","completion":"Iron will corrode faster in a damp area like a rainforest compared to a dry area like a desert. This is because the main cause of iron corrosion is its reaction with moisture (usually from the air or water) and oxygen. In a damp environment like a rainforest, there is more moisture and humidity, which increases the rate of corrosion. In a dry environment like a desert, there is less moisture available for the iron to react with, thus slowing down the corrosion process. As for Jim and Eric, Jim's decision to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air is wise, as it helps prevent corrosion of the iron components, while Eric's boat is more likely to corrode faster due to the lack of protection."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

On March 19, 2002, Audioslave was confirmed for the seventh annual Ozzfest; despite, at that time, having neither an official name nor a release date for their debut album. A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience. Cornell's manager confirmed that the frontman had left the band, with no explanation given.Initial rumors suggested that Cornell took issue with having two managers actively involved in the project (Jim Guerinot of Rebel Waltz represented Cornell, and Peter Mensch of Q Prime handled Rage Against the Machine). According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm. Their previous labels, Epic and Interscope, settled their differences by agreeing to alternate who released the band's albums.Meanwhile, 13 rough mixes of songs the band had created months previously were leaked to peer-to-peer filesharing networks in May 2002, under the name \\"Civilian\\" (or \\"The Civilian Project\\").

As Elmer has Bugs Bunny cornered on his hunting trip, Elmer receives a telegram from his Uncle Louie who leaves him 3 million in his will, as long as he doesn't harm any animals, especially rabbits. Elmer changes his tune to one of uncharacteristic niceness and sets Bugs free. Bugs, with characteristic élan, takes full advantage of the situation by sneaking into Elmer's house before Elmer returned and making himself at home. As Elmer returns, he hears Bugs singing \\"Angel in Disguise\\", while taking a shower and later shaving; Bugs uses the opportunity to purposely aggravate Elmer, knowing that he has Uncle Louie as blackmail and because of this Elmer cannot effectively punish Bugs in any way at the risk of losing his inheritance. Elmer tries to coax Bugs into leaving, gently patting him on the head, which Bugs claims that he is hurting him and threatens to call Uncle Louie. Elmer apologizes to Bugs then tricks him into walking out of the house. Bugs resorts to faking a serious illness, prompting Elmer to take him back in, afraid he may have lost the inheritance for good.
