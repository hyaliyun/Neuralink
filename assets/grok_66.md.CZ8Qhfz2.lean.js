Think like you are answering to a five year old. Jessica Hilda Mauboy was born on 4 August 1989 and raised in Darwin, Northern Territory. Her father, Ferdy, is an Indonesian born electrician who came from West Timor, and her mother, Therese, is an Indigenous Australian. Mauboy's mother is from the indigenous Kuku Yalanji people in the rainforest regions of Far North Queensland. Mauboy has three older sisters Sandra, Jenny and Catherine, and a younger sister Sophia. In January 2010, Mauboy signed to Universal Music for an exclusive worldwide long-term publishing agreement. In May 2010, Mauboy collaborated with four other international artists representing their continents--Sean Kingston representing America, Jody Williams representing Africa, Tabitha Nauser (Asia), Steve Appleton (Europe), with Mauboy representing Oceania--on the theme song for the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics titled \\"Everyone\\". Mauboy, Williams, Nauser and Appleton performed \\"Everyone\\" at the opening of the Youth Olympics held in Singapore on 14 August 2010. Kingston was unable to attend the performance, due to a passport mix-up. Mauboy released her second studio album Get 'Em Girls on 5 November 2010; it debuted at number six and was certified gold. She had travelled to the United States in February of that year to work on the album in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta with American songwriters and producers, most of whom she had not worked with previously. Mauboy co-wrote eight of the album's songs. Get 'Em Girls received mixed reviews from critics. Majhid Heath of ABC Online Indigenous gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars, writing that it's a \\"non-cohesive mess of similar sounding, auto-tuned ravaged pop/R&B that diminishes the talent of this brilliant young songstress\\". The album's title track, featuring American rapper Snoop Dogg, peaked at number 19. Mauboy performed \\"Get 'Em Girls\\" at the 2010 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards, where she co-hosted the award ceremony with Liam Hemsworth and Jerry Trainor, and won the award for Fave Aussie Muso. The following singles, \\"Saturday Night\\" featuring American rapper Ludacris and \\"What Happened to Us\\" featuring English singer Jay Sean, peaked at numbers seven and 14, respectively. The former single was certified double platinum while the latter was only certified platinum. At the 2010 Australian of the Year Awards, Mauboy received her first nomination for Young Australian of the Year. On 10 December 2010, she performed in front of an audience of 92,000 at the Federation Square in Melbourne, ahead of Oprah Winfrey's visit to the place. Mauboy's performance was shown in the first of the four Australian specials of The Oprah Winfrey Show on 18 January 2011. In April 2011, she served as a support act for Chris Brown's Australian leg of his F.A.M.E. Tour. Get 'Em Girls was re-released as a deluxe edition on 12 August 2011, which included the singles \\"Inescapable\\" and \\"Galaxy\\" featuring Stan Walker. The former single peaked at number four and was certified double platinum, while the latter peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum. \\"Galaxy\\" also reached number 36 on the New Zealand Singles Chart and became Mauboy's first single to chart in that country. On 17 November 2011, Mauboy performed for the Australian troops at RAAF Base Darwin, ahead of US President Barack Obama's visit to the place. In January 2012, Mauboy and Walker embarked on their Galaxy Tour across Australia, which served as her first headlining tour. Mauboy recorded 15 songs for The Sapphires' soundtrack album, which was released on 27 July 2012. The album debuted at number one and was certified platinum. Mauboy released \\"Gotcha\\" as the album's lead single, which peaked at number 43 and was certified gold. At the 2012 ARIA Music Awards, she was nominated for Best Female Artist, Best Pop Release for \\"Gotcha\\", and Song of the Year for \\"Galaxy\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When was Get Em Girls released?","completion":"Get 'Em Girls was released on 5 November 2010."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a \\"Daniel Vavinsky,\\" published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.The court established that \\"Daniel Vavinsky\\" was a pseudonym for Clément Weill-Raynal, a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of Actualité Juive, were fined €5,000 each, and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David's appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli's prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court's decision.In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal's 50-page medical file, and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were \\"completely different wounds\\" from the 1994 injuries.

But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a second mortgage of 100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond (Robin Strasser). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed. Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal (Joe Spano) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman.

Louis Burton Lindley Jr. was born in Kingsburg, California, the son of Sally Mosher (nee Turk) and Louis Bert Lindley Sr., a Texas-born dairy farmer. Young Lindley was an excellent horse rider from an early age. Known as \\"Bert\\" to his family and friends, he grew bored with dairy farming and began to make a few dollars by riding broncos and roping steers in his early teens. His father found out and forbade this activity but he took no notice, went to compete in a rodeo, and was told by the doubtful rodeo manager that there would be \\"slim pickin's\\" for him. After nearly 20 years of rodeo work, his distinctive Oklahoma-Texas drawl (though he was a lifelong Californian), his wide eyes, moon face, and strong physical presence gained him a role in the Western film film Rocky Mountain (1950) starring Errol Flynn. He appeared in many more Westerns, playing both villains and comic sidekicks to the likes of Rex Allen. Hollywood made good use of Pickens' rodeo background. He did not need a stand-in for horseback scenes, and he was able to gallop his own Appaloosa horses across the desert, or drive a stagecoach pulled by a six-horse team. In a large number of films and TV shows, he wore his own hats and boots, and rode his own horses and mules. Pickens appeared in dozens of films, including Rocky Mountain (1950), Old Oklahoma Plains (1952), Down Laredo Way (1953), Tonka (1959), One-Eyed Jacks (1961) with Marlon Brando, Dr. Strangelove (1964), Major Dundee (1965) with Charlton Heston, the remake of Stagecoach (1966; Pickens played the driver, portrayed in the 1939 film by Andy Devine), Never a Dull Moment (1968), The Cowboys (1972) with John Wayne, Ginger in the Morning (1974) with Fred Ward, Blazing Saddles (1974), Poor Pretty Eddie (1975), Rancho Deluxe (1975), The Getaway with Steve McQueen, Tom Horn (1980), also with McQueen, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) with Michael Caine and Karl Malden, An Eye for an Eye (1966) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). He had a small but memorable role in Steven Spielberg's 1941 (1979) in scenes with Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee; during one scene, he enumerates the objects on his person, similar to the way he does in the \\"Survival Kit Contents Check\\" scene in Dr. Strangelove. In 1978, Pickens lent his voice to theme park Silver Dollar City as a character named Rube Dugan, for a ride called \\"Rube Dugan's Diving Bell\\". The diving bell was a simulation ride that took passengers on a journey to the bottom of Lake Silver and back. The ride was in operation from 1978 to 1984. He also played werewolf sheriff Sam Newfield in The Howling (1981). In 1960, he appeared in the NBC Western series, Overland Trail in the episode \\"Sour Annie\\" with fellow guest stars Mercedes McCambridge and Andrew Prine. Pickens appeared five times on NBC's Outlaws (1960-62) Western series as the character \\"Slim\\". The program, starring Barton MacLane, was the story of a U.S. marshal in Oklahoma Territory -- deputies played by Don Collier, Jock Gaynor, and Bruce Yarnell -- and the outlaws that they pursued. In 1967, Pickens had a recurring role as the scout California Joe Milner on the ABC military Western Custer, starring Wayne Maunder in the title role. In 1975, Pickens was in another Western, playing the evil, limping bank robber in Walt Disney's The Apple Dumpling Gang; that same year, the exploitation classic Poor Pretty Eddie was released, with Pickens portraying twisted Sheriff Orville. He provided the voice of B.O.B. in the 1979 Disney science-fiction thriller The Black Hole. His last film was his least notable, Pink Motel (1982) with Phyllis Diller.

The Farrelly brothers' direction and choice to return to their trademark gross-out humor is also met with lukewarm responses.

Determine the type of cast you have. Know when to see the doctor. Article:","completion":"Title: Taking Care of Body Casts – Tips for the Bathroom and Beyond Introduction Body casts are essential in supporting the healing process for individuals who have suffered fractures, dislocations, and other musculoskeletal injuries. They help to immobilize the affected body part, allowing proper alignment and minimizing pain experienced during recovery. However, maintaining personal hygiene and everyday activities, particularly using the bathroom, can be challenging for someone with a body cast. This article aims to guide you through the necessary precautions when it comes to caring for your cast while using the bathroom, along with other essential tips for maintaining the integrity of your body cast. Understanding Your Cast First and foremost, it is crucial to know the type of cast you have applied to your body. There are two primary types of body casts: plaster casts and synthetic casts. Plaster casts are made from a combination of water and plaster powder, whereas synthetic casts often consist of fiberglass material. It is essential to know which type of cast you have, as this will determine the appropriate care measures to take. Using the Bathroom One of the main concerns when using the bathroom with a body cast is ensuring that the cast remains secure and dry. Here are some helpful tips to consider: 1. Preparation is key: Before entering the bathroom, gather all necessary items such as toilet paper, wipes, and any other toiletries you will need. Having everything within reach will prevent you from struggling and potentially damaging your cast. 2. Use additional support: Depending on the location of your cast, you may need to use a shower chair or railings to support your body. This will not only aid in maintaining balance but also help to avoid straining any injured areas. 3. Keep your cast dry: Avoid soaking your cast in water, as doing so may weaken and compromise its structural integrity. Use a waterproof cast cover or plastic bag to protect the cast from getting wet, especially when taking a shower. 4. Maintain a clean and dry cast: After using the bathroom, ensure that your cast is dry and free of any moisture or residue. This will prevent complications like skin irritation and infections. Avoiding Deodorizers and Personal Care Products While it is important to maintain good personal hygiene, some products can be harmful to your body cast. Avoid using deodorizers, powders, and lotions on or near the cast, as these can cause the material to break down and compromise its effectiveness. In addition, refrain from inserting any objects under the cast to scratch or clean your skin. Doing so may cause skin irritation and increase the risk of infection. When to Consult a Doctor Be vigilant about monitoring the condition of your cast and the healing process. If you notice any changes that raise concerns, contact your doctor immediately. Potential issues include: 1. Signs of infection: Swelling, redness, increased pain, or a foul smell coming from the cast area should be reported to your doctor, as these could indicate an underlying infection. 2. Damaged cast: A crack, softening, or general wear in your body cast could indicate it is no longer effectively supporting your injury. Seek medical attention to have your cast replaced or repaired. 3. Persistent discomfort and pain: If you are experiencing persistent pain or discomfort that doesn't improve with time, consult your doctor to adjust your cast or discuss alternative treatment options. Conclusion Taking care of your body cast is a crucial part of your recovery journey. By knowing the type of cast you have, following appropriate bathroom practices, and recognizing when to seek medical assistance, you can ensure the best possible outcome for your healing process. Remember, your health and well-being should be your top priority, so take the necessary precautions and collaborate with your healthcare providers to enable a safe and swift recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what is a social security number in the uk?","completion":"In the United Kingdom, there isn't an exact equivalent to the United States' Social Security Number (SSN). However, the National Insurance Number (NINo) shares some similarities with the U.S. SSN, serving as a unique personal identifier for various social benefit purposes. The National Insurance Number (NINo) is an alphanumeric code issued by the UK's Department for Work and Pensions to citizens and residents to track their National Insurance (NI) contributions. It plays a crucial role in the administration of various social benefits and welfare schemes, such as state pensions, unemployment benefits, and healthcare services provided through the National Health Service (NHS). A NINo generally consists of two letters, followed by six digits and a final letter, for example, AB123456C. This unique identifier ensures accurate recording of an individual's NI contributions and tax payments, which in turn are used for eligibility assessment in various government programs and services. Here are some of the main features and functions of the UK's National Insurance Number: 1. Tax and National Insurance Contributions: The NINo is used by employers to deduct the correct amount of income tax and NI contributions from employees' wages. It is also used by self-employed individuals when filing their tax returns to calculate their NI liabilities. 2. State Benefits and Pensions: The NINo is essential for claiming various state benefits, such as Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit, and Carer's Allowance. Additionally, when an individual reaches the state pension age, their NI contributions are assessed based on their NINo records to determine their eligibility and pension amount. 3. Healthcare Services: Although the NINo is not a mandatory requirement for accessing healthcare services through the National Health Service (NHS), it can be requested by medical providers as a way to verify a person's eligibility for subsidized treatment. 4. Proof of Identity: The NINo is sometimes used as a method of identification in certain situations, such as applying for government programs or dealing with financial institutions. It is important to note that the National Insurance Number is not intended to serve as a general identification number. While there is no equivalent UK system to the U.S. Social Security Number, the NINo fulfills some of the same purposes, primarily in the realms of taxation, social benefits, pensions, and health services."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lopez, 42, a former mayor and presidential candidate, has been held in a military jail for well more than a month.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

He says that \\"the color of leaves on deciduous trees usually changes in the autumn season\\" and \\"mulberry trees are deciduous\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"Given the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What do mulberry trees do in the autumn?\\" would be (i). Change colors. The teacher's hints emphasized that mulberry trees are deciduous, which means they shed their leaves seasonally. Autumn is the season when deciduous trees undergo significant changes, especially in their foliage. The leaves of deciduous trees change color due to the cessation of chlorophyll production as temperatures decrease and daylight hours shorten. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of leaves, and as it breaks down, other pigments such as carotenes and anthocyanins become more visible, giving leaves their characteristic autumn hues such as orange, yellow, and red. As the mulberry tree is a deciduous tree, it follows the same pattern of leaf color change during the autumn season. The process of color change in leaves is called senescence, and it is accompanied by the eventual shedding of leaves as the tree prepares for winter dormancy. The color-changing process is an important aspect of a mulberry tree's life cycle, enabling it to conserve energy during the colder months when photosynthesis is less efficient. It also has ecological benefits, as the fallen leaves decompose and provide nutrients for the tree and its surrounding soil, supporting overall forest health. In conclusion, based on your teacher's hints, the most accurate answer for the quiz question \\"What do mulberry trees do in the autumn?\\" is (i). Change colors, as this aligns with the characteristic behavior of deciduous trees during the autumn season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"In SoHo, an AprÃ¨s-Studio Apartment\\" Article:","completion":"Title: In SoHo, an Après-Studio Apartment Introduction Nestled within the heart of Manhattan lies the bustling neighborhood of SoHo, known for its rich history, architectural beauty, and vibrant art and fashion scenes. Synonymous with luxury, this trendy locale is home to numerous upscale boutiques, art galleries, and posh eateries. Amidst this opulence, one can find a unique living experience— the après-studio apartment. This chic, modern concept is taking the urban living world by storm, as it combines the simplicity of a studio with the sophistication of larger, more extravagant living spaces. Concept and Origins The après-studio apartment encapsulates an innovative approach to urban dwelling, born out of a need to elevate the traditional studio apartment experience. Historically, a studio flat includes a bedroom, living room, and kitchen all combined within a single room. While offering affordability and ease in terms of maintenance, these spaces often limit creativity in design and furnishings due to a lack of available space. The concept of the après-studio reimagines this style of living, maintaining the compact nature of a studio, but with an air of elevated luxury and refinement. Design Elements To facilitate this shift in perspective, après-studio apartments incorporate design elements that maximize space utilization while simultaneously allowing residents to indulge in sophisticated, high-end aesthetics. Key strategies in achieving this balance include: 1. Multi-functional Furniture: Furnishings that feature multiple functions facilitate space-saving while increasing overall efficiency. This includes fold-out beds that transform into sofas, wall-mounted dining tables, and storage solution pieces like built-in wardrobe units, sliding bookcases, or lofted bed platforms with drawer units beneath. 2. Open Floor Layouts: By removing traditional barriers between various living areas, an open floor concept generates an illusion of spaciousness within the compact confines of a studio. This layout not only encourages natural light distribution throughout the apartment but also promotes a unified, cohesive design aesthetic. 3. Strategic Use of Colors and Textures: Selecting light wall colors, such as whites or neutrals, can remarkably expand the perception of spaces. Incorporating reflective surfaces and materials — for example, mirrors, tiles with a glossy finish, and polished metals— can heighten this effect. In contrast, adding precisely curated splashes of color and rich textures can contribute to a distinct ambiance and charm. 4. Smart Storage Solutions: Creative storage techniques can dramatically impact apartment functionality. Simple ideas such as mounting shelves or cabinetry on walls, installing vertical storage racks in closets, or adding hooks for hanging items help effectively organize and declutter living spaces. 5. Luxury Additions: The inclusion of high-end finishes and fixtures, such as stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, and sleek lighting installations, elevates the overall sense of refinement and sophistication in après-studio apartments. The SoHo Influence SoHo's reputation as a cultural and avant-garde epicenter renders it the ideal backdrop for après-studio living. The neighborhood's historic cast-iron buildings and cobblestone streets lend a distinctive character to these spaces, merging seamlessly with contemporary design features. The abundance of nearby galleries, upscale shopping, and eclectic dining establishes an invigorating symbiosis between artistic pursuits and urban dwelling, further enhancing the appeal of the après-studio apartment. Conclusion In a city as dynamic and bustling as New York, the après-studio apartment reflects a compelling alternative to traditional studio living, striking a balance between minimalism, luxury, and space efficiency. Offering a truly unique housing concept, SoHo's après-studios embody the perfect marriage between modern design and historic architecture, resulting in an elevated living experience designed for the discerning urbanite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

A store covers a broader range of products to cater to various needs and preferences, making it the most suitable choice among the given options. Here's why the other options are less suitable: 1. Health food store: While a health food store might sell beverages, they generally focus on offering healthier, organic, and natural food items. A can of soda, which usually contains high levels of sugar and artificial ingredients, is less likely to be found in a health food store. 2. Liquid: This option is not a location or point of purchase, but rather a state of matter. It does not have any relevance to the question. 3. Picnic cooler: A picnic cooler is an insulated container designed for keeping food and drinks cold during outdoor activities, such as picnics. It is not a place where you would buy items; rather, it is a storage option for goods that are already purchased. 4. Vending machine: While it is possible to buy a can of soda from a vending machine, these machines typically offer a limited selection of items and usually only sell drinks or pre-packaged snacks.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer a question about the following article about Antenna (radio): The difference in the above factors for the case of θ=0 is the reason that most broadcasting (transmissions intended for the public) uses vertical polarization. For receivers near the ground, horizontally polarized transmissions suffer cancellation. For best reception the receiving antennas for these signals are likewise vertically polarized. In some applications where the receiving antenna must work in any position, as in mobile phones, the base station antennas use mixed polarization, such as linear polarization at an angle (with both vertical and horizontal components) or circular polarization. What is one use that would require an antenna to receive signals in various ways at once?","completion":"One prominent use that requires an antenna to receive signals in various ways at once is in mobile communications, particularly in the case of mobile phones or cellular networks. In normal situations, a specific directional orientation of the antenna is required to receive signals, which are based on the polarization adopted by the broadcasting station. However, mobile devices pose a unique challenge since it's practically impossible to maintain a constant alignment due to their portable nature. As mobile phones are constantly moving and can be held in any position – upright, sideways, or even upside down – the orientation of their internal antennas is continuously changing in relation to the base station they are connecting to. This non-fixed orientation necessitates the requirement for an antenna capable of receiving signals in all directions, or in other words, in various ways at once. To address this, base station antennas often use mixed polarization to ensure that they can communicate effectively with mobile devices in any orientation. This may involve linear polarization at an angle (which has both vertical and horizontal components), ensuring the bases can cover both vertical and horizontal planes. Alternatively, they may use circular polarization, which has the capacity to receive signals from any plane of orientation. Moreover, using mixed polarization can help improve the quality of the signal received and reduce the cancellation effect that could occur due to environmental elements, such as reflections and obstacles. It can greatly enhance the reliability and quality of mobile communication, providing uninterrupted service regardless of how or where the mobile device is positioned relative to the base station."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason Kidd announced his retirement Monday after 19 seasons as one of the best passing and rebounding point guards in NBA history. The thought of retirement first began to creep into the New York Knicks point guard's mind around the All-Star break. But he didn't think seriously about it until recently. Over the weekend at a wedding in Georgia he made the decision. \\"I think it is the right time,\\" Kidd told ESPNNewYork.com. \\"When you think about 19 years, it has been a heckuva ride. Physically, I want to be able to participate in activities with my kids so it has taken a toll. It is time to move on and think about maybe coaching or doing some broadcasting. \\"Jeff [Schwartz] and I and my family had been talking this past weekend,\\" Kidd added of his agent. \\"We talked a lot and we felt it was the right time to move on and so we notified the Knicks. They were kind of taken aback. We told them [earlier] that I wanted to come back and play. But this weekend was when we got a chance to relax [and really think about it]. It is the right thing to do.\\" Kidd, 40, leaves the game as a sure-fire Hall of Fame point guard. The 10-time All-Star led the NBA in assists five times and finished second all-time in assists and steals behind John Stockton. Kidd, who had two years remaining on his contract at just more than 3 million per year, leaves with a legacy that includes an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks and two Olympic gold medals with Team USA. \\"The two things that are probably tied for first are winning a championship with the Mavericks and also being able to win a gold medal -- two gold medals with Team USA,\\" Kidd said of what he's most proud of in his career. \\"And then underneath that will probably be sharing Rookie of the Year with Grant [Hill].\\" Hill, also 40, announced his retirement on Saturday. During his prime, the versatile Kidd was like an instant fast break due to his uncanny court vision, instincts and ability to rebound. The 6-foot-4 Oakland, Calif., native, who was one of the most hyped high school prospects of his generation, had more triple-doubles (107) than anyone outside of Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Kidd averaged 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals in 1,391 regular-season games. He took great pride in his ability to make teammates better and his knack for turning teams around. \\"The biggest thing is winning,\\" Kidd said of what he wants to be remembered for. \\"No matter what percentage, no matter what my numbers say in the sense of points, assists, rebounds and steals, it's always been about winning. And it will always be about winning … making my teammates better.\\" The second overall pick out of California in the 1994 draft entered the league as part of the \\"Three J's\\" with Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn in Dallas. Kidd sparked the Mavericks to a 36-win season -- a 23-game improvement from the season before -- to earn co-Rookie of the Year honors with Hill. After being dealt to the Suns two and a half seasons later, Kidd led the team to a 16-game improvement in his first full season in Phoenix in 1997-98. And then after being traded to New Jersey in 2001, Kidd transformed the Nets into instant contenders. With Kidd playing at an MVP level, the Nets won 52 games -- a 26-game leap from the season before. It was the Nets' first 50-win season in their NBA history. Kidd also lifted the franchise to the first of two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. \\"What we accomplished in New Jersey with the Nets, from the bottom and being able to get to the Finals, back to back, that was really special,\\" Kidd said. After losing to Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan in back-to-back NBA Finals, Kidd finally got his coveted championship ring as a Maverick. Teaming up with Dirk Nowitzki, Kidd topped LeBron James and the Heat in six games in 2010-11. In his 19th and final season, Kidd signed with the Knicks and helped them win 54 games, an 18-game improvement from the season before. It was the franchise's first 50-win season since 1999-2000. The Knicks, though, were eliminated in the second round by Indiana in six games. Kidd struggled in the postseason, failing to make a basket in his last 10 playoff games. ||||| According to the New York Knicks, Jason Kidd will retire after 19 seasons in the NBA. Grant Hill, who shared the rookie of the year honor with Kidd in 1995, also retired over the weekend. That leaves just one player left in the league from the 1994 draft class -- Miami Heat veteran Juwan Howard. Howard is a year older than Lakers guard Steve Nash, but shares the same birthday. Nash, born Feb. 7, 1974, is now the second-oldest player in the league, and with Kidd and Hill retiring (both 40), the oldest player under contract past the current season. Nash still has two more seasons on his deal with the Lakers for a total of 19 million. In his first year with the Lakers, the veteran point guard struggled to stay healthy -- missing 32 regular season games (broken leg, hip, hamstring, nerve issues). By the postseason he just didn't have the strength to play and the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash were drafted in 1996. The 1995 draft class is represented by Kevin Garnett, who still has another two years left on his deal with the Boston Celtics, and Jerry Stackhouse, whose contract with the Brooklyn Nets is expiring. Kurt Thomas was also drafted in 1995 but has yet to formally retire. Other players drafted in 1996 who haven't retired include Derek Fisher, Marcus Camby and Ray Allen. Bryant has played through 17 seasons but at 34, he's not among the 20 oldest players in the NBA -- Jason Terry Kenyon Martin and a number of others are older than Bryant.

There are overlapping coverages on your insurance policies.","completion":"No, the term \\"coverage\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Although both instances use the word \\"coverage,\\" they refer to two different concepts. Let's examine the contexts in which the word is being used in each sentence: 1. \\"They accused the paper of biased coverage of race relations.\\" In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the way a topic or subject is reported, analyzed, or represented by a news medium, such as a newspaper, television station, or digital news platform. Coverage, in this context, often conveys the portrayal, tone, and the depth of the stories that get reported. Here, the accusation implies that the paper is unfairly or disproportionately representing the topic of race relations. This can involve presenting one-sided arguments, omitting certain facts or perspectives, or favoring a particular group or narrative while neglecting or downplaying others. Hence, \\"coverage\\" in this context refers to the overall reporting or presentation of a subject by the news medium. 2. \\"There are overlapping coverages on your insurance policies.\\" In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the protection or financial security provided by an insurance policy. In the context of insurance, coverage is the extent to which the specific risks or damages are insured by the policy, and the monetary limits or extent of these guarantees. \\"Overlapping coverage\\" occurs when a policyholder has multiple insurance policies that provide coverage for the same risks or damages, which can lead to duplication or redundancy in protection. For instance, having two car insurance policies that both cover collision damage would be an example of overlapping coverage. In such cases, it might be advisable to adjust the policies to avoid unnecessary expenses and potential complications during a claim process. In summary, while both sentences use the term \\"coverage,\\" they refer to different concepts – the first pertains to the reporting of events and issues in the news media, while the second refers to the extent and scope of protection provided by insurance policies. These differing meanings highlight the importance of considering context when trying to understand the meaning of a word or term."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

CONTEXT: 13 de julio de 2009 La agencia espacial de Estados Unidos, NASA, tiene previsto lanzar el transbordador espacial Endeavour este lunes, después de que debiera postergar por cuarta vez su lanzamiento debido a malas condiciones de tiempo. Las autoridades dicen que tratarán de lanzar el transbordador por la tarde, a las 6.51, hora del Este de Estados Undios, 22:51 hora universal. Sin embargo, meteorólogos no pronostican que mejoren mucho las condiciones climáticas. Tormentas eléctricas forzaron a la NASA a cancelar el planeado lanzamiento del Endeavour el domingo para una misión de 16 días a la estación espacial internacional. El sábado, la partida fue postergada después de una serie de rayos cayeran en el sitio de lanzamiento. El mes pasado, el lanzamiento del Endeavour fue cancelado dos veces debido a fugas de hidrógeno. La tripulación de siete miembros del transbordador tiene previsto instalar una terraza de construcción japonesa en la Estación Espacial Internacional, durante cinco actividades extra vehiculares.

Please answer this question: who wrote the song georgia on my mind?","completion":"\\"Georgia on My Mind\\" is a song written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell in 1930. Both composers contributed their talents to create this classic, which has become one of the most iconic and enduring songs in American music history. Hoagy Carmichael, born Howard Hoagland Carmichael, was an American composer, pianist, singer, and actor. He was born on November 22, 1899, in Bloomington, Indiana, and passed away on December 27, 1981. Carmichael is considered one of the great American songwriters of the 20th century, contributing many classic tunes to the Great American Songbook, a collection of the most enduring and influential American songs from the 1920s to the 1950s. Some of his other notable compositions include \\"Stardust,\\" \\"Heart and Soul,\\" \\"The Nearness of You,\\" and \\"Skylark.\\" Stuart Gorrell, born Stuart Graham Steven Gorrell, was an American lyricist who worked in various fields but is best known for his contribution to the song \\"Georgia on My Mind.\\" Gorrell was born on September 17, 1901, in Knox, Indiana, and passed away on August 10, 1963. Although he had a successful career in the advertising industry and as a banker, Gorrell's most famous and lasting achievement remains his work on this iconic song. \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" was originally written as a tribute to the state of Georgia and its people. It was not initially written about a particular person, despite many believing it to be about a woman named Georgia. The song's lyrics express a sense of longing and nostalgia for Georgia, with its beautiful landscapes and warm-hearted people. Over the years, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" has been covered by many artists in a variety of music styles, including jazz, blues, soul, and pop. The most famous rendition of the song was recorded by the legendary Ray Charles in 1960. Charles, a native Georgian, infused his soulful interpretation with genuine emotion and admiration for the state, making it a massive hit. His version became the official state song of Georgia in 1979, further cementing the song's place in American popular culture."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is the recipient of several awards, including two Filmfare Awards, and is among the highest-paid actors in the country. After completing a bachelor's degree from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh returned to India to pursue his career in films. He made his acting debut in 2010 with a leading role in Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat. In 2016, Singh starred in Aditya Chopra's comedy-romance Befikre opposite Vaani Kapoor. He played Dharam Gulati, a stand-up comic whose romantic liaisons with Kapoor's character leads to conflict between them. Set in Paris, Befikre marked the fourth project to be directed by Chopra. Singh performed a nude scene for it--a rare occurrence in an Indian film. Jay Weissberg of Variety found the film to be an \\"overly energetic twist on the old friends with benefits theme\\" and criticised Singh's \\"manic behavior\\". It underperformed at the box office. After a year-long absence from the screen, Singh portrayed Alauddin Khilji, a ruthless Muslim king, in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama Padmaavat (2018), co-starring Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, which marked his third collaboration with Bhansali and Padukone. Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film distorted historical facts, and issued violent threats against the cast and crew. The film's release was deferred and was allowed for exhibition after several modifications were made to it. Ankur Pathak of HuffPost criticised the film's misogynistic and regressive themes, but praised Singh for his \\"astute brilliance\\" in depicting Khilji's bisexuality. Rajeev Masand opined that he \\"plays the part with the sort of grotesque flamboyance that makes it hard to look at anyone or anything else when he's on the screen\\". Padmaavat's production budget of Rs2 billion (US31 million) made it the most expensive Hindi film ever made. With a worldwide gross of Rs5.44 billion (US83 million), it ranks as Singh's highest-grossing release and is among India cinema's biggest grossers. As of January 2018, Singh will star opposite Alia Bhatt in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, a musical based on the life of rappers living in Mumbai's ghettos. He will also star in Rohit Shetty's Simmba, a remake of the Telugu action film Temper, co-starring Sara Ali Khan.

Answer the following question: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote? And it worked on most people. This woman was not one of them. Question: Why did Ray hold the phone away from his ear? Options: A. The woman was going to scream at him. B. not enough information C.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century Question: \\"Why was it hard for Madame White snake to be the ideal wife?\\" Answer: \\"Neologism\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. Let me explain it to you like I'm talking to a five-year-old. Madame White Snake is a character from an old Chinese legend. She is a snake that turns into a woman and becomes a man's wife. Over time, her character became more like a good wife, but still, she couldn't live happily with her human husband because she had a dangerous side to her. This danger comes from her being a femme fatale, which means a lady who is hard to resist and can cause trouble. So, even though she had some qualities of an ideal wife, her dangerous side made it hard for her to be the perfect wife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

This led to the discovery that Ninnis, his sledge, and dog team had fallen through the wide crevasse with straight ice walls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater.

Definition: In this task you will be given a string and you should find the longest substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Input: pbbbpxxxbxbb Output:","completion":"The output would be: \\"bbbxbbb\\" To find the longest palindromic substring in the given input \\"pbbbpxxxbxbb\\", we can follow these steps: 1. Start with the first character of the given input, 'p', and check for the palindromes generated by expanding the window centred around this character. Since it does not have a symmetric character on either side, the only palindrome is the single character 'p'. 2. Move on to the second character of the input, 'b'. Notice that we can construct the palindrome \\"bb\\" by checking the symmetric characters on both sides of the current character. Thus, the longest palindrome so far is \\"bb\\". 3. Continuing, consider the third character, 'b'. Here, we can construct the palindromes \\"bbb\\" and \\"bbbxbbb\\". Since \\"bbbxbbb\\" is longer than the previously found palindrome, \\"bb\\", we take \\"bbbxbbb\\" as the new longest palindrome. 4. Keep iterating through the characters of the input string to see if any palindromes are longer than the current longest palindrome. In this case, no longer palindromes are found, so the longest palindromic substring of the input remains \\"bbbxbbb\\". 5.

To hook marks, he acts like a well-to-do businessman, dressing like one and driving a Mercedes-Benz S500, believing that one must look like a professional in order to be a successful conman. Gaddis is searching for a new partner with whom he can perform more sophisticated cons. He discovers Rodrigo after he sees the young man playing some minor con games in a casino-bar. When Rodrigo is caught, Gaddis acts the part of a vice officer to save him from being arrested. Rodrigo's contribution is a face and naive manner so trustable that he is able to con anyone, while Richard is both completely unprincipled and clever. After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts. Richard accepts, and they plan to sell a fraudulent version of a silver certificate currency note to William Hannigan, a rich collector who is in town. Gyllenhaal plays Gaddis' sister Valerie, a concierge at a hotel. When Hannigan takes a fancy to the uptight but very sexy Valerie, Gaddis is forced to pull her into the scam, the price of which is Richard's admission to their brother Michael that he has cheated him out of his share of their inheritance.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To improve your blood pressure, Pick from: * have some coffee at the end of the day.. * have some broth at the end of the day..","completion":"To determine which solution is better for improving blood pressure, I will consider the effects of each option on blood pressure. Step 1: Analyze the effects of coffee on blood pressure Coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Consuming caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure, especially in people who are sensitive to it or who are not regular consumers. However, the effect of coffee on blood pressure can vary from person to person. In some cases, moderate coffee consumption may not have a significant effect on blood pressure. Step 2: Analyze the effects of broth on blood pressure Broth, especially if it is made from bones and vegetables, can be a source of beneficial nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals have been associated with lower blood pressure. However, it is important to consider the sodium content of the broth. High sodium intake can raise blood pressure. Choosing a low-sodium broth or making homemade broth with little added salt can help counteract this potential issue. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, having some low-sodium broth at the end of the day seems to be the better solution for improving blood pressure. While coffee does not necessarily have an adverse effect on blood pressure for everyone, it could lead to a temporary increase for some individuals. On the other hand, broth contains essential nutrients that can positively impact blood pressure, as long as the sodium content is controlled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break down the phrase and analyze the tone. 1. Negative aspect: The use of \\"hardly\\" is a strong qualifier that negates the value of whatever comes after it. In this case, it is pointing towards the 'worth' of the particular action or endeavor. By considering the effort \\"hardly\\" worth it, the speaker implies that the result or outcome may not be as significant or satisfactory as expected. 2. Resignation: This phrase may also be interpreted as an expression of resignation or giving up on a task. In this context, the speaker acknowledges that there is a potential outcome or reward, but believes that it's not worth pursuing because the perceived effort outweighs the possible benefit. This may imply a lack of motivation or unwillingness to invest time and resources into something that might not provide the expected result. 3. Devaluation: Another aspect of this phrase is devaluation or diminishing the importance of a task or action. When someone says \\"hardly seems worth the effort,\\" they are trivializing the objective and suggesting that it's not valuable enough to consider pursuing. This devaluation can also be a form of self-defense or protection, not wanting to invest emotionally or physically in an activity that might be deemed as insignificant in the long run. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"hardly seems worth the effort\\" can be perceived as negative due to its underlying tone of resignation, lack of motivation, and devaluation. The speaker is expressing their belief that pursuing a particular task or action may not result in substantial payoff, which influences their decision or opinion on whether or not to engage in it. This perspective could affect the morale and outlook of others involved, potentially leading to a loss of interest or commitment to the task at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village.

She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base. A veteran of World War I, he has been awarded a Victoria Cross, but has a crippled leg and suffers from shell shock. Rosy is instantly attracted to him.

Born and brought up near Edinburgh,Mollie has devoted her talents to writing primarily for young people. She firmly believes that there is and should always be a wider audience for any good book whatever its main market is. In Mollie's opinion it is necessary to make full use of language and she enjoys telling a story,which is what every writer should be doing. \\"If you aren't telling a story, you're a very dead writer indeed.\\" She says. With the chief function of a writer being to entertain,Mollie is indeed an entertainer. \\"I have this great love of not only the meaning of language but of the music of language,\\" she says. \\"This love goes back to early childhood. I had a school teacher who used to ask us what we would like to be when we grew up and,because my family always had dogs,and I was very good at handling them,I said I wanted to work with dogs,and the teacher always said 'Nonsense,Mollie;dear,you'll be a writer.' So finally I thought that this woman must have something,since she was a good teacher and I decided when I was nine that I would be a writer.\\" This childhood intention is described in her novel,A Sound of Chariots,which although written in the third person is clearly autobiographical and gives a picture both of Mollie's ambition and her struggle towards its achievement. Thoughts of her childhood inevitably brought thoughts of the time when her home was still a village with buttercup meadows and strawberry fields--sadly now covered with modern houses. \\"I was once taken back to see it and I felt that somebody had lain dirty hands all over my childhood. I'll never go back,\\"she said \\"Never. When I set one of my books in Scotland\\" she said \\"I can recall my romantic feelings as a child playing in those fields,or watching the village blacksmith at work. And that's important because children now know so much so early that romance can't exist for them, as it did for us.\\" Options: A She didn't expect to become a writer.

The military says at least 12 people were on board the C-130 Hercules, which crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside Medan, where the pilot told the control tower he was suffering engine trouble, reports the AP. The news agency notes that 143 people died in the city a decade ago when a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crashed into a residential neighborhood. Article:","completion":"Title: Indonesian Military C-130 Hercules Crash Kills At Least 30 in Residential Neighborhood At least 30 people have been confirmed dead after an Indonesian military transport plane crashed into a residential neighborhood in Medan, one of the country's largest cities. Officials have informed Reuters that the death toll may increase as the investigation and recovery mission continues. The number includes both military personnel and local residents affected by the tragic event. The Indonesian military reported that at least 12 people were on board the C-130 Hercules when it crashed just minutes after taking off from an air force base outside Medan. According to the Associated Press (AP), the pilot had informed the control tower that the plane was experiencing engine trouble prior to its crash. The plane, which was carrying both military personnel and equipment, was bound for a routine mission when it encountered difficulties and came crashing down upon the residential neighborhood. This tragic incident marks yet another aviation disaster in the city of Medan, which was also the site of a Mandala Airlines Boeing 737 crash a decade ago. That earlier crash took the lives of 143 people when the airliner plummeted into a residential neighborhood. With this previous incident in mind, today's tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the challenges and risks associated with aviation, particularly in densely populated areas. As the investigation into the cause of the C-130 Hercules crash continues, the Indonesian military and local authorities will work together to assess the damages, provide support to those impacted by the event, and determine if any additional steps are necessary to prevent future accidents of this nature. In the meantime, responders from various agencies have been mobilized to assist with search, rescue, and recovery efforts, as well as to provide medical services and other essential support for those affected by this devastating crash. With the current death toll standing at 30, and the possibility of an increase as more victims are discovered, the people of Medan and the greater Indonesian community are once again grappling with the painful realities of a major aviation disaster. As it unfolds, the investigation into this incident will hopefully shed light on the factors that contributed to this tragedy, and prompt appropriate action to enhance the safety of air travel in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bern opened the first war phase on 26 April, when its first troops crossed the river Aar at Stilli, to support Zürich with the occupation of Thurgau and the assault on the abbatial lands. In mid-May, about 3000 Zürichers, 2000 Bernese, 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands and first hit upon the abbatial city of Wil, that fell on 22 May after a short siege. The allies then pushed forward to St. Gallen and occupied the Abbey of Saint Gall and the Vogtei Rheintal. The abbot fled to Neuravensburg, a lordship north of Lake Constance that the abbey had acquired in 1699. The five Catholic cantons did occupy Rapperswil, but initially left the abbot without any support. In concordance with contemporaneous laws of war, the abbey and its goods were put an under a military governance and the chattel and riches were abducted to Bern and Zürich. How many more Bernese soldiers marched to the Princely Lands than Protestant Thurgauers?","completion":"In the context provided, there were 2,000 Bernese soldiers and 1,800 Protestant Thurgauers that marched into the Princely Lands. To determine the difference in the number of soldiers between these two groups, subtract the number of Protestant Thurgauers from the number of Bernese soldiers: 2,000 Bernese soldiers - 1,800 Protestant Thurgauers = 200 Thus, there were 200 more Bernese soldiers who marched to the Princely Lands than Protestant Thurgauers."},{"prompt":"I have a new situation: Two researches studied the Earth's mantle. Clint studied mantle melting, and his pal Uri decided to study other mantle related phenomena. But I can use this background: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. What is an answer for this question: Which researcher read less about adding water to the mantle?","completion":"The researcher who read less about adding water to the mantle is Uri, as he decided to study other mantle related phenomena, while Clint studied mantle melting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: The racist charge is both quirky and wacky. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"It is important to fully analyze the premise and hypothesis to determine if one can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Firstly, let us break down both the premise and the hypothesis to get a better understanding of their meanings and implications. Premise: \\"But the racism charge isn't quirky or wacky--it's demagogy.\\" This statement seems to argue that accusing someone of racism is not merely an unusual or odd occurrence (\\"quirky\\" or \\"wacky\\"). Instead, it is a demagogic act, which typically means appealing to people's emotions, fears, and prejudices rather than using a more rational or thoughtful argument. Hypothesis: \\"The racist charge is both quirky and wacky.\\" In contrast to the premise, this statement claims that accusing someone of racism is, in fact, quirky and wacky, meaning that it might be unusual or not based on substantial evidence. It suggests that the racism charges might be considered lighthearted or not as serious. Now, let's address the original question: Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis? Given our evaluation of both statements, it appears that the premise and the hypothesis are essentially presenting two opposing ideas. The premise claims that racism charges represent demagogy and are not quirky or wacky. Meanwhile, the hypothesis suggests that racism charges are indeed quirky and wacky. In this context, if we accept the premise as true, it becomes impossible to conclude that the hypothesis is also true. Accepting the premise means that racism charges are demagogic and not quirky or wacky, so we cannot conclude that they are quirky and wacky as the hypothesis suggests. Instead, if the premise is true, one might argue that the hypothesis is false. The statements contradict each other, and if one is true, it inherently means that the other cannot be true simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write highlights for this article: Luke Shaw admits his performances since joining Manchester United have not yet justified his price tag but vows: ‘You’ll see my best soon.’ The England Under 21 left back endured a difficult night in the 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion, only his third club match following his £31million move from Southampton having picked up a hamstring injury and had questions raised over his fitness. The result leaves United 10 points behind Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday and are seen by many as champions-elect. But Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luke Shaw say his focus is solely on impressing Van Gaal. Luke Shaw admits his performances have not lived up to his £31million price tag at Manchester United. Shaw (centre) walks off after West Bromwich Albion's second goal on Monday night at The Hawthorns. ‘No not yet. It’s a long season so we’ll have to see what happens,’ he said. ‘We’re going to work hard this week and be ready for the challenge on Sunday. It’s a massive test. They’re flying at the moment.’ On his own form Shaw provided a commendably honest appraisal, having received some criticism over his defensive credentials. He was partly at fault for Stephane Sessegnon’s opening goal at The Hawthorns by getting drawn too central trying to win the ball. Shaw, 19, said: ‘I know I haven’t been up to my full potential and I think maybe people can see that at the moment. They haven’t seen the best of me yet. ‘I am trying hard and it’s about getting used to everything. When you come to a club like this it’s never easy for a young player like me. But I’ll get myself starting soon and put in good performances. ‘I wouldn’t say I’ve been horrendous but I know I can do much better. And I need to do better. I’ve come to Manchester United and I know what they need. I’ve been working hard and the performances will come.’ Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title. Shaw, who broke into the Southampton first team two years ago, was told by Louis van Gaal to improve his fitness during pre-season. Roy Hodgson also voiced his concerns. He had to wait for his debut until West Ham visited Old Trafford last month, and was withdrawn in his next match against Everton as a precaution over a knee complaint. But during the international break he played 180 minutes as England Under 21s beat Croatia over two legs to progress to Euro 2015 and that action provided a psychological and physical boost. ‘It always helps and the main thing for me was it was two 90 minutes for fitness,’ he said. ‘I feel fit but like I said I haven’t played my best recently. That’s football. Hopefully I’ll come out of it now. I think I could still get a bit fitter from working hard in training. But I do feel pretty fit in training.’ At The Hawthorns, Van Gaal set up United in a third different formation of the season, having started with a 5-3-2 system before switching to a midfield diamond. Manchester United players look dejected after West Brom's opening goal at the Hawthorns. Against West Brom it looked more 4-1-4-1 with Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj hugging the wings. Shaw described the formation as 4-3-3 and insisted it relatively straight-forward to adjust tactics. ‘It’s not too difficult, we had a few days to work on it,’ he said. ‘We did a lot of work based on the 4-3-3 formation with wide wingers. ‘We knew what we had to do against West Brom but unfortunately we didn’t get the result. It’s definitely two points lost, we’re Man United, we come to win every game. ‘It’s two points lost because we were positive ahead of the game. They only had two shots on target (but scored twice) and that’s not good enough for us. We’ll focus hard this week and be ready for the game on Sunday.’ VIDEO Van Gaal not happy after two lost points.","completion":"- Luke Shaw admits his performances have not yet justified his £31 million transfer to Manchester United. - Shaw endured a difficult night during 2-2 draw with West Bromwich Albion and faced criticism over his defense. - Despite Manchester United being 10 points behind Chelsea, Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion. - Shaw acknowledges he has not yet shown his full potential but believes his best performances are soon to come. - Shaw played 180 minutes for England Under 21s, which he feels provided a physical and psychological boost."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Back on the trail by Wednesday ||||| CNN is reporting that instead of heading to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses tonight, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson will be headed home to Florida to -- at least according to his campaign representative -- prepare for the National Prayer Breakfast. This decision could be strategic, since Carson first rose to national prominence due to his appearance at the National Prayer Breakfast, or it could be the first sign that he will be the next Republican candidate who believes the road to the White House is now too long and arduous for his campaign. ||||| Ben Carson's national finance chairman Dean Parker resigned Thursday morning amid questions about his use of campaign fund and criticism from Carson allies and donors. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, appointed Parker, a tech industry entrepreneur from Mobile, Alabama, in May to spearhead the campaign’s fundraising efforts. Parker’s been a relatively little-noticed campaign power, having Carson’s ear despite friction with other leaders. Since he joined, some campaign insiders told POLITICO, his operation has piled up unnecessary expenses and paid hefty consulting fees to an inexperienced staff. Parker recently began earning a 20,000 monthly salary, which veteran campaign operatives say is unusual for what is typically an unpaid, honorary role. Story Continued Below The bills for Parker’s shop, the inside sources said, were easy to overlook in the fall as the campaign raked in small donations, Carson soared in the polls and the campaign’s direct-mail operation generated tens of millions of dollars. But Parker’s operation became a sore point as the campaign lost its footing in mid-November and the candidate’s poll numbers slipped, they added. Even as senior leaders questioned Parker in leadership discussions, Carson still backed him on financial and hiring decisions, the campaign sources said. Campaign finance reports show Parker’s operation, based in Mobile, racked up at least 216,000 in expenses from July through September, the most recent quarter for which reports are publicly available. Many of those expenses were paid through a network of limited liability companies set up for individual consultants on Parker’s finance team. The bottom line is a small fraction of the millions spent on direct mail, phone solicitations and list-building in the same period. But Parker’s detractors say he also frustrated some donors with brusque behavior and infuriated a longtime Carson confidant, Terry Giles, by insinuating that Giles orchestrated a leak of internal documents. “He drove right over you. He’s kind of bullyish. His arms are spread open so nobody gets by him,” said Nancy Pickard, a Carson fundraiser based in North Carolina whose son was once a patient of Carson’s at Johns Hopkins. Pickard, who hosted a September event for Carson that she said raised about 200,000, said Parker routinely blocked her access to Carson. In an interview on MSNBC shortly after resigning, Parker said he stepped down to refocus the media's attention. \\"It was time to say, you know what? I'm not going to let him have me be the focus of his campaign during a debate or this season getting so close to Iowa,\\" Parker said. \\"I sat down with him this morning and I said, Dr. Carson, I love you. I know you love me. We've been great friends. We will continue to be great friends. I'm wondering if the best thing I could do is to get rid of this attention because nothing was done wrong, and we don't need the media building this up.\\" A Carson campaign spokesman said the campaign is still searching for a successor to fill the position in a \\"voluntary role.\\" A source familiar with the campaign's thinking told POLITICO that Mike Murray, a veteran of direct mail fundraising with a long history of campaign work, is under consideration for either a temporary or permanent appointment. Parker, who recently said he’d take a bullet for Carson, can’t seem to fathom the fury that’s suddenly coming his way. “Everything I’ve done has been on Dr. Carson’s behalf. Everything I do was with his approval and his blessing,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that everybody in leadership, like any company, would always agree.” For every donor who might complain, he said, others would vouch for his integrity. One is Bill Millis, another North Carolina fundraiser who helped lead Carson’s campaign until he departed in November over strategic disagreements. Millis called Parker “a good man, who is committed to Dr. Carson.” “I don’t know all of the in’s and out’s relative to expenses, and would certainly accept that some expenses may have been unnecessary,” he wrote in an email, “but [the] majority was necessary in order to keep Dr. Carson and his message visible.” Parker also pointed to a story in the Alabama-based news outlet Yellowhammer that he said praised his performance. The article featured a comment from an anonymous source who said Parker had done a “good job” for him and ripped into “professional political consultants” running the campaign. “Unfortunately for the 10 and 20 and 50 donors who believe in Dr. Carson, only a fraction of their money has been put to good use,” the source told Yellowhammer. Parker claims his Mobile-based team helped Carson, a political novice, raise 1 million a month in the fall, a powerhouse operation built from scratch that’s expanding as the Republican nominating contest nears. Large-donor fundraising, he said, increased 10-fold from May, when he joined the campaign, and the ratio of his expenses to contributions is in the single digits. Parker said he has added state finance chairs around the country in recent weeks. He told POLITICO his team spent funds appropriately and that he began collecting a salary only this month. Campaign management experts said it is unusual for finance chairmen to receive any salary. “Usually a chair is not somebody that’s getting paid to do that job,” said Katie Packer Gage, former deputy manager of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. “It’s somebody that has relationships with lots of donors, and so it’s a more symbolic kind of role that demonstrates that somebody in the donors’ peer group is on board.” Ray Washburne, national finance chairman of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's campaign, said paying a finance chairman defeats the purpose of the role. “If they think I’m getting a scrape on the money as a finance chairman, you lose all your credibility,” he said. “When you’re raising money 2,700 a person, someone making 20,000 a month — that’s eight to 10 maxed-out donors.” Washburne said the value of a finance chairman is the ability to make a “peer to peer sale” with fellow donors. He pointed to Marco Rubio’s finance chairman, Wayne Berman, and Jeb Bush’s finance chairman, Woody Johnson. “If there was a financial gain for us on it, it’s harder to look somebody in the eye to raise money.” But Parker said he’s an exception because, unlike other finance chairmen, he’s working in the role full time, and he said the campaign felt more comfortable compensating him for that time. “It’s 100 percent what I do. I put all my business holdings on hold,” said Parker, who advised C-Spire, the tech firm that acquired his company, Callis Communications, two years ago. “I started this on May 5. I have been home an average of four days a month.” In a statement, the campaign confirmed its rationale for providing Parker with a salary. “After volunteering full-time for several months, the campaign asked Dean to establish a contract relationship, so that they could properly reimburse for expenses,” said spokesman Larry Ross. Parker said he emphasizes frugality and finding good, “cautious” deals to ensure donors’ dollars are wisely spent. In some ways, the criticism of Parker is classic backbiting from a campaign in turmoil. Many of Carson’s senior staff quit the campaign on New Year’s Eve, citing a dysfunctional organization with tangled chains of command — Carson had tepidly signaled a coming shakeup — but Parker stayed. He said he’s been a “trusted adviser” to Carson for a couple of years, though he added that he had nothing to do with the campaign shake-up. “The shake-up was all him,” Parker said, referring to Carson. “I was sad to see some of the guys go.” The criticisms of Parker come as Carson attempts to revive his campaign in Iowa, which will become the first state to weigh in on the Republican presidential nominating contest on Feb. 1. Polls show he’s still tied for third there, and he’s counting on a top-three finish to sustain his campaign through February. Documents leaked to The Wall Street Journal suggested the campaign has blown through tens of millions of dollars, primarily on cumbersome direct-mail and telephone operations, eliminating the financial cushion that would help Carson carry through the early-voting states. Carson raised a combined 43 million in the last six months of 2015, but, by some accounts, he started the year with less than 10 million on hand. Though Carson led presidential polls heading into November, his campaign tumbled amid questions about Carson’s inspiring personal narrative and his readiness to handle foreign policy issues. That’s why sources who voiced complaints to POLITICO worried that Parker’s finance operation is no longer sustainable. In the three months ending on Oct. 1, the most recent quarter for which public filings are available, the campaign paid 145,000 in costs it described as “travel” to Parker's firm, Vita Capital. Parker said those payments actually covered fundraising expenses. He said the campaign did use his private plane to shuttle around Carson and staff, but he said those billings went through a “third party.” He said his plane’s services were offered at fair market value after a competitive bidding process. At the campaign’s recommendation, Parker said, the expenses he and his team incurred were charged on the credit card of Vita Capital, and he received reimbursements. Public filings show the payments went through two companies: Vita Capital and Communication Management Source, which is managed by Parker’s wife, Joanne. An 18,000 rent payment to the firm KP Investment, a limited liability company formed in 2004, traces to Parker, too. Parker said the rent payment reflected the cost of a six-month lease, furniture and utilities for a property in which he is a partner. He said he may have made “three or four thousand dollars” in fees. In fact, much of the finance operation Parker built in Mobile is difficult to decipher from campaign filings. Nearly everyone on his staff set up a separate LLC after joining the campaign and received consulting payments in the quarter that ended Oct. 1. LLCs like Interim C, DB Operations, and Synergy Networks were established explicitly for the campaign and trace back to individuals who were paid as finance consultants. Mary Broughton, who lists her occupation as a substitute teacher and graduated from Liberty University in 2014, collected nearly 15,000, through MC Consulting, established in June. Rachel Howat, who was a Mobile County nutritionist until joining the campaign in June as “finance operations director,” collected more than 15,200 through The Amna Agency. A further 8,000 flowed in September to Interim C, a Michigan-based LLC whose manager, Kevin Demery, used to work with Parker at Callis Communications. Demery lists his title as the campaign’s national vice chairman of finance. The team also reported a 644 “finance consulting” payment to Haley Ikner, a University of Mobile junior and Miss Alabama aspirant who worked as an intern. “I admire Dr. Carson and what he stands for, as well, so it seemed perfect. I got the internship and did various tasks such as calling sponsors to thank them for their support to letting them know when Dr. Carson would be in an area near him,” she said. In November, Parker also hired part-timer Halie Biggs, a North Carolina-based model who began pursuing a business administration degree at North Carolina State University this year. A picture on Biggs’ Twitter feed shows her with Parker, Carson’s son Ben Carson Jr., and singer/songwriter will.i.am at a dinner hosted by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. Parker said the campaign encouraged supplying employees with separate LLCs, allowing them to work under contract rather than as official staff. Parker attributed the “young or inexperienced” nature of his team to the fact that he’s running a “grass-roots” operation. “We didn’t have a donor list. We couldn’t afford high-dollar fundraisers,” Parker said, adding that when he joined the campaign in May, it was bringing in 100,000 from major donors each month — a number that’s since grown 10-fold. The Carson campaign didn’t respond to questions about Parker’s assertion that it encouraged the use of contract employees, recommended use of personal credit cards and encouraged Parker to accept a salary. Conflicts with Parker flared into the open last month after a dispute with Terry Giles, who chaired the campaign in the spring but was elbowed out over strategic differences. Late last month, Giles sent a scorching letter to Carson, his wife Candy and a dozen senior campaign officials in which he called Parker a liar. In the letter, obtained by POLITICO, Giles said Parker, while at a gathering of Houston donors, blamed him for a leak to The Wall Street Journal that included damaging revelations about the campaign’s finances. Parker alleged that Giles had tricked Millis into revealing the damaging information over the phone while a Journal reporter was listening in. Giles denied the charge and wrote that he was incensed Parker would make the accusation in his hometown. “After Bill Millis communicated with the donor/fundraiser and explained that this story was a complete fabrication and that no such thing happened, I was able to calm down the rightfully upset donor,” he wrote. “But that does not take away the fact that the campaign came into my city and told a group of donor/fundraisers (and folks who are Carson supporters because of Kalli and myself, lies about me which made it appear that I was undercutting the campaign.” Asked about the incident, Giles said he would neither confirm nor deny it, but added, “I’m not a fan of Dean Parker.” Parker acknowledged the dust-up but said he apologized a day after seeing Giles’ letter and sent a letter of regret to the donors he met with, arguing that his comment had been “taken out of context” and that he shouldn’t have discussed the episode at all. For the most part, Parker expressed surprise that he has become the target of so much vitriol and described a “great relationship” with Carson’s senior aides — including some who are no longer with the campaign. He added that he hopes to put to bed any questions about his use of campaign funds and his relationship with donors. “If there’s not a story here, let’s not write it,” he urged. But he insisted he was happy to answer questions raised by his critics. “We just want the truth reported. I’m giving it to you,” he said. “We have nothing to hide.” ||||| Ben Carson will head back to his home in Florida following the Iowa caucuses Monday night and take a break from campaigning for a few days, according to his campaign.

We need to make sure we always have a copy of those things, just in case something goes wrong with our toy box (the hard drive). Now, let's learn how to back up and restore our hard drive in just a few simple steps! Step 1: Back up your hard drive It's always a good idea to keep a copy of the things in our toy box. This is called \\"backing up\\" our hard drive. Ask a grown-up to help you find out which method of backing up (copying) is provided by the company who made your computer. This will keep all your important things safe, and you can get them back if you need to. Step 2: Find the right way to restore Different computers have different ways to restore (fix) the toy box when it gets messy or has trouble. Ask a grown-up to check which method your computer manufacturer recommends. Step 3: Insert the operating system disk You'll need a special shiny circle (called an operating system disk) to help fix your computer. This shiny circle tells your computer how to work and how to fix any problems. Ask a grown-up to put this special shiny circle into the CD/DVD drive (it's a special door just for shiny circles!). Step 4: Wait for the magic to happen Once the shiny circle (operating system disk) is in the CD/DVD drive, your computer will start to work on fixing any problems. You don't need to do anything, just sit back and wait for the magic to happen. Step 5: All done! It might take some time for the computer to finish fixing the toy box (hard drive), but when it's done, everything should be just like it was before. Now you can get back to playing your games and looking at your pictures without any worries! And that's it, little friends! You've learned how to back up and restore your hard drive.

Peter Thomas Ward, born on July 26, 1937, in Montreal, Quebec, pursued a successful career in professional baseball, playing nine seasons for the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees in Major League Baseball. His dedication to the sport and achievements in his professional career highlight his connection to and passion for athletics. Moreover, Ward's father, Jimmy Ward, was a professional athlete who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a forward. This connection to professional sports within his immediate family emphasizes the presence and importance of sports within the Ward family. Additionally, as Ward attended Jefferson High School in Portland, Oregon, and played college baseball at Portland's Lewis & Clark College, his involvement in sports extended beyond his family circle to include his educational and developmental experiences. In conclusion, we cannot assert that Ward's family didn't play sports. Instead, the information provided indicates that sports played an essential and influential role in the lives of both Peter Thomas Ward and his family, showcasing a strong family connection to athletics and their professional sports legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

Today is May Day!\\" my sister announced. \\"Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?\\" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \\"Absolutely not!\\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \\"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, \\"Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!\\". Question: Why was Susie angry with Pam?

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the person who was responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946? ? On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\".

Elaborate funeral plans have been set in motion in South Africa following the death of the country’s revered first black president Nelson Mandela. The memorial, expected to last ten days, will be an unparalleled event in South Africa’s history, drawing a plethora of foreign dignitaries of every stripe, royals and a smattering of celebrities. South African President Jacob Zuma ordered the nation's flags to be flown at half-mast beginning today and to remain that way until after Mandela's funeral, which he announced would be held next Sunday. Scroll down for videos. Iconic funeral: Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela will lie in state for several days next week before a massive funeral service that will draw numerous heads of state and celebrities. The public will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a memorial service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium (above) that hosted the 2010 World Cup. Fitting location: Mandela's body is expected to lie in state in the Union Buildings in Pretoria (above) where he was inaugurated as President. Soldiers guard Mandela's home in Qunu, where he will be laid to rest in accordance with his final wishes at a service on Sunday, December 15. Hours after his death last night, a black SUV-type vehicle containing Mandela's coffin, draped in South Africa's flag, pulled away from Mandela's home after midnight, escorted by military motorcycle outriders, to take the body to a military morgue in Pretoria, the capital. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the service, which will be attended by all living US presidents, past and present. The White House said last night that President Barack Obama is expected to travel to South Africa to bid farewell to Mandela along with numerous other world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron. Counting himself among the millions influenced by Nelson Mandela, President Obama mourned the death of the anti-apartheid hero with whom he shares the distinction of being his nation's first black president. 'He no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages,' Obama said in a somber appearance at the White House. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George Bush. Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton. Nelson Mandela's unifying force will be evident in the guest list at his funeral which will include black and white world leaders, TV stars and musicians. U.S. President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle and their daughters will be joined by all past living U.S. presidents, including Bill Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well. Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Charles are believed to be in line to attend. Several celebrities who had personal ties to the late great leader, such as Oprah Winfrey and U2 frontman Bono, are also expected to attend the service. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the service. Preparations for funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill. The. sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure. to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which. will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn. event. According to several sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu. At some stage during days one to four, Thembu elders are expected to gather for a first ceremony called 'the closing of the eyes' either at his home or in the mortuary. After the ceremony, it is believed his body will be embalmed at the mortuary, thought to be a military hospital in Pretoria. No formal public events are expected to take place until day five, December 10, when mourners will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a service at the 94,000-capacity Johannesburg soccer stadium that hosted the 2010 World Cup. It is not clear whether Mandela's casket will be taken there. On days six to eight, December 11 to 13, the anti-apartheid hero's body is earmarked to lie in state in a glass-topped coffin at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was inaugurated as president on May 10, 1994. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa. Representing Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, seen with Mandela at a photo shoot for his 90th birthday in London, will pay their respects. On day nine, plans have been made for. a military aircraft to fly Mr Mandela to Mthatha, the main town in the. South African province of Eastern Cape. His. casket will then be taken by the military on a gun carriage to Qunu,. his home village, where the former leader spent his childhood years. To. mark the formal passing of responsibility to his family, the South. African flag that is expected to drape his coffin will be replaced by a. traditional Xhosa blanket. Later, ANC leaders, local chiefs and Mandela's family are expected to gather for a private night vigil. On. the final day, Mandela will finally be laid to rest in the grounds of. his family home in Qunu, where thousands of people, including heads of. state will gather for the state funeral. Giving thanks: All living former US leaders, including George W. Bush, pictured meeting Mandela in 2001, have been invited. Royal representation: The British Royal family, including the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will fly to South Africa to honour Mandela. Mr Mandela often spoke with great love of his first home where his family members, including his children who predeceased him, rest. The family plot is located just a few yards from the home he shared with his mother as a child and the one which he built following his release from Victor Verster Prison. He loved Qunu 'in the unconditional way a child loves his first home' and spent holidays and special occasions here. Star-studded event: The memorial service is expected to draw many celebrities who had a personal relationship with Mandela, including Oprah Winfrey pictured here in 2002. Friends: U2 front man Bono, with Mandela at his Johannesburg home in 2002, is thought to have been invited. The protocol for the funeral. preparations was drawn up more than a year ago, around the time when Mr. Mandela's health took a turn for the worse, and it may be altered in the. coming days. Mourners. will be able to share their thoughts about Mandela’s passing in. condolence books that will be made available in all foreign missions,. the Nelson Mandela Foundation headquarters and other institutions,. according to The Guardian, which has obtained a copy of the protocol. It. has also been reported that the South African Government is in talks. with the BBC team that filmed the Royal Wedding in 2011 to get help with. the world wide broadcast of the funeral of a global icon. Guests at the funeral will include Mr Obama, the first lady and their daughters. Bill and Hillary Clinton, who knew Mr Mandela well, are also expected to make an appearance. The scale and significance of the planned funeral is already being compared to the 2005 service for Pope John Paul II, which was attended by 2million people, among them five kings and 70 presidents. Days one to four (Today to December 9): According to sources involved in planning the state funeral, the 10-day occasion will combine both Western traditions and those of Mandela's native clan, the Thembu.

I was super happy to catch the silhouette of the ISS over the disc of the moon last night! The CalSky website sends me alerts for potential fly overs for which I’ve been waiting a long time – about 12 months. I got one this week and this was adjusted by 15 seconds by the time of the “occultation”. If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you’d be absolutely correct! The ISS only passed over the moon for 0.33 seconds as it shoots by quite quickly. Knowing the second it would pass I fired a “burst” mode of exposures then crossed my fingers and hoped it would show up in review – and it did! The setup was my Canon 70D attached to the rear cell of my Celestron 9.25″ telescope (2350mm / f10). The shutter speed was a quick 1/1650th of a second and ISO 800 in order to freeze the ISS in motion. I took about a second of further exposures on either side of the pass to stack the lunar surface detail using AutoStakkert2, and the increased the saturation in post to create this colour enhanced version of the moon. The colours on the moon relate to the chemical composition of moon geology. Here is a close up so you can see the modules and the solar arrays captured fairly clearly! UPDATE : This kinda went viral on all the major social networks. I’m so glad others were as excited as I was about this photo! Thank you everybody for all your kind words. UPDATE 2 : I’ve reprocessed the image into a higher resolution! The new version above is 2998 pixels wide and much cleaner.

At such speeds the weightless research laboratory was visible for only about a third of a second before returning to the dark skies. Dylan captured the moment in Byron Bay, New South Wales, the eastern-most point of Australia, where the absence of larger towns offers low levels of light pollution. The image was taken on 30 June 2015 at 19:54 local time with the Space Station flying 400 km above the Pacific Ocean. A conventional camera was placed behind a 2300 mm / f10 telescope and Dylan took as many pictures as possible during the Station’s brief passage and hoped for the best. Five images of the Moon taken before and after the Station passed by were processed using freely available astrophotography tools to improve sharpness, a process called stacking. Lastly, the colours were enhanced to bring out the Moon’s colourful surface geology. This is the first picture of the Station Dylan has published, commenting, “I take many types of pictures but the International Space Station is a wonderful target and one I’ve wanted to capture for a long time.” Spotting the orbital complex yourself is easier than you might think. It can be seen and photographed without special equipment as it passes overhead. As it moves so fast, the hard part is to know when and where to look. ESA’s tracker shows you where the Station is at any time and you can sign up to receive alerts for your neighbourhood here. Once you know where the Space Station will be, it is best to wait for dawn or dusk. It looks like a very bright star or aircraft gliding through the sky. For less advanced pictures without using the Moon as a background, use a tripod and set the shutter speed to a long exposure of up to a minute. The Station will always arrive from the west and will appear as a white streak in the photograph. |||||Summary:","completion":"Dylan O'Donnell, an amateur photographer in Australia, captured an incredibly rare and stunning photo of the International Space Station (ISS) passing over the moon.

The finding came from a Gallup survey of more than three hundred and forty thousand adults in the United States in 2008.At that time,people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study.His team found that levels of stress were the highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five.Stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. Levels of happiness were the highest among the kids and those in their early seventies. The survey also found that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older.However, women at all ages reported more sadness,stress and worry than men did.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Available options: (a). Yes. (b). No. Answer:","completion":"Answer: (a). Yes. Deforestation, which involves the large-scale removal of trees and other vegetation, is indeed the right answer to the question, \\"doing what to plants has a negative impact on the ecosystem?.\\" The act of cutting down plants, specifically trees, has a broad range of negative consequences for the ecosystem and the environment as a whole. 1. Habitat loss: Deforestation leads to the destruction and fragmentation of habitats, resulting in the displacement or extinction of numerous plant and animal species. The loss of biodiversity has a cascade effect on other species within the ecosystem and affects their survival chances. 2. Carbon sequestration: Forests are crucial carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Cutting down trees significantly reduces their capacity to sequester carbon, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate change. 3. Water cycle disruption: Trees play a vital role in maintaining the water cycle, returning water to the atmosphere through transpiration. Deforestation disrupts this process, causing changes in precipitation patterns and an increased likelihood of droughts and floods. 4. Soil erosion: Trees and other plants act as natural anchors for the soil, providing stability and reducing erosion. Deforestation causes the soil to lose structure and can lead to landslides, flooding, and sediment deposition in rivers and streams, adversely affecting aquatic ecosystems. 5. Decreased oxygen production: Through the process of photosynthesis, plants produce oxygen, which is essential for life on Earth. With fewer trees and plants in the ecosystem, less oxygen is produced, impacting both aquatic and terrestrial species. 6. Impact on indigenous communities: Deforestation often leads to the displacement of indigenous communities who rely on forests for their livelihoods, cultural traditions, and spiritual practices. This displacement has a negative impact on the overall well-being and integrity of these communities. In conclusion, deforestation, or cutting down plants on a large scale, has numerous negative impacts on the ecosystem. The consequences of this action can be felt on various levels, from habitat destruction to climate change, and reaffirm the importance of preserving and protecting forests and other natural plant communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And so, in this article, we explore the fascinating world of some of the top companies from diverse industries. I would like to share the joy of working with one of these fantastic organizations, giving you a vivid glimpse of their ethos and work culture. Identifying the Best Companies To provide context, it is essential to understand what criteria determine the best companies. Factors such as employee satisfaction, workplace infrastructure, management, opportunities for learning and development, benefits, work-life balance, and a strong organizational culture collectively contribute to an outstanding work environment. Various publications issue an annual list of the best companies to work for based on these criteria. While lists may differ, some companies consistently appear in multiple rankings. Our Inclusive and Diverse Culture One of the most admirable aspects of working at a top company is the inclusive environment and diversity in the workplace. My organization has a strong foundation of respect, empathy, and understanding that resonates from the higher management to the newest recruit. This translates into a workforce that consists of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ages, gender, and experience levels, which creates a harmonious blend of ideas and innovative thinking.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones.

Write an article based on this summary: – Despite continued hand-wringing over fiscal policy, President Obama remains on schedule to push for immigration reform this month, an insider tells the Huffington Post. The effort will likely be led by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who warns that \\"in the end, immigration reform is going to depend very much on whether Speaker Boehner wants to do it.\\" Still, the fiscal cliff negotiations suggest the House Republican leadership could be open to compromise, say immigration reform advocates. Even without Congress, Obama is taking action on the issue: An executive order by the Homeland Security department yesterday offers illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the US while applying for permanent residence—if they can show that time away from close American citizen relatives would cause \\"extreme hardship,\\" the Los Angeles Times reports. Some 1 million people could be affected by the new rules. Before the change, which takes effect in March, the application process could keep spouses, parents, or children away from family members for up to a decade, the New York Times notes. Article:","completion":"Title: The Road to Immigration Reform: President Obama's Unwavering Commitment Amid Fiscal Policy Concerns Despite the economic challenges and fiscal policy concerns faced by the United States government, it is evident that the immigration reform issue remains a top priority on President Obama's agenda. This month, a strong push towards immigration reform is expected to take place, with Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren leading the effort, an insider recently informed the Huffington Post. However, the fate of these reforms may significantly depend on whether or not Speaker Boehner is willing to champion the cause. The United States' fiscal policy debates have been a cause of concern for many, with the 'fiscal cliff' situation raising uncertainties regarding the country's future economic stability. Amidst these concerns, focusing on immigration reform might seem like a tough challenge for the government. However, the progress in the fiscal cliff negotiations has shed light on the possibility of a compromise between the two parties to address this critical issue. Advocates of immigration reform have found hope in the fact that the House Republican leadership has shown signs of openness to compromise during the fiscal cliff negotiations, which might be indicative of a similar stance on immigration reform. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a stalwart supporter of immigrants' rights, has warned that decisive action on this issue will largely depend on the willingness of Speaker Boehner to address the immigration reform. Apart from seeking support from Congress, President Obama has also been proactive in tapping into other avenues to tackle the immigration issue. In a recent executive order by the Department of Homeland Security, provisions have been made for illegal immigrants, enabling them to stay in the United States while applying for permanent residence. To qualify, applicants must be able to prove that their absence from the U.S. would result in \\"extreme hardship\\" for their close American citizen relatives, according to the Los Angeles Times. This new measure could potentially impact around 1 million people who have been living in the country illegally. Before the implementation of this rule, which is slated to take effect in March, the application process would often separate family members for a prolonged period, sometimes up to a decade. These recent developments point towards a steadfast approach by the Obama administration to address the immigration reform issue head-on, ensuring the welfare of millions of people in the United States. By offering illegal immigrants the chance to stay in the U.S. while pursuing permanent residency and working closely with lawmakers to shape a comprehensive reform, President Obama demonstrates his unwavering commitment to providing a more secure and inclusive future for all residents of the country, irrespective of their current legal status. As the United States grapples with the complexities of fiscal policy and seeks to foster economic stability, the progress on immigration reform serves as a testament to the resilience and optimism of a government focused on securing a better life for its people. With the possibility of a bipartisan effort led by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren and the potential support of Speaker Boehner, the road to immigration reform may finally lead to a promising destination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"I will answer each question individually and then address whether the answers to both questions are the same. Question 1: Do all Pandora charms fit all Pandora bracelets? Why or why not? Answer 1: Yes, all Pandora charms are designed to fit all Pandora bracelets. This is because Pandora creates their charms and bracelets using a standardized threading system. Each charm has a hole with a threaded interior that can easily screw onto any Pandora bracelet, regardless of its specific design or size. This system allows for versatility and personalization, as customers can mix and match charms to create unique combinations. Question 2: How do you put charms on a Pandora bracelet? Answer 2: To put charms on a Pandora bracelet, follow these steps: Step 1: Open the clasp of the bracelet. Most Pandora bracelets have a barrel clasp that opens by applying pressure to the groove on one half of the clasp, then twisting it counterclockwise. Step 2: Slide the first charm onto the bracelet by threading the bracelet through the charm's hole. Rotate the charm so that its hole aligns with the bracelet's threaded end, and then screw the charm onto the bracelet. Step 3: Continue to add charms by repeating Step 2, making sure to secure each charm by screwing it onto the bracelet. Alternate between different sizes, styles, and colors to create an appealing pattern. Step 4: Once you've added all the desired charms, close the bracelet by aligning both halves of the barrel clasp and twisting them clockwise until they snap together. To answer your final question, the answers to both questions are not the same because they address different aspects of the Pandora charm and bracelet system.

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.

Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - Rolling Stones Records was the record label formed by the Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman in 1970, after their recording contract with Decca Records expired. It was first distributed in the United States by Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco Records. Beginning in 1973 it signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records. In 1986 Columbia Records started distributing it. In the UK, it was distributed by EMI. The label was initially headed by Marshall Chess, the son of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess. It was discontinued in 1992 when the band signed to Virgin Records, but the tongue-and-lips logo remains on all post-1970 Rolling Stones releases. - \`\` Some Girls '' is the title track of English rock and roll band the Rolling Stone 's 1978 album Some Girls . It marked the third time a song on one of the band 's albums also served as the album 's title and is noted for its risque lyrics concerning the title 's \`\` some girls '' . Alongside previous Stones releases that courted controversy ( \`\` Under My Thumb '' , \`\` Brown Sugar '' , \`\` Star Star '' ) due to their apparently degrading lyrics towards women , \`\` Some Girls '' caused a ruckus among both feminists and civil rights activists over such lyrics as \`\` black girls just want to get fucked all night '' and \`\` Chinese girls are so gentle / They 're really such a tease '' . Mick Jagger and the band defended the song , saying the lyrics mocked actual stereotypical feelings towards women . Saturday Night Live cast member Garrett Morris commented on the controversy with a mock - editorial on the show 's Weekend Update segment : After giving the impression that he was going to openly criticize the Stones , he quoted a sanitized version of the \`\` Black girls just ... '' line , then stated \`\` I have one thing to say to you , Mr. Mick Jagger ... where are these women ? ! ? '' The song is demonstrative of the unconventional uses of steel guitars heard throughout the Some Girls album , with an unusual , droning , phased two - chord groove that 's among the Stones ' most unusual arrangements . The original cut of the song ran some 23 minutes and featured verses Jagger came up with as they went along . Harmonica player Sugar Blue provides some virtuosic blues - style solos on the track . The song was featured heavily on the Stones ' 1999 North American No Security Tour which concentrated on lesser - known songs from the band 's catalogue . A performance during the band 's 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour was captured for the 2008 live album Shine a Light . - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s. - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles. - Some Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by the Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records. It reached number one on the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart, and became the band's top selling album in the United States, certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \\"Exile on Main St.\\" - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences. - Exile on Main St. is a double album by English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records and was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. The record's music incorporates rock and roll, blues, soul, country, and gospel genres. Although it originally received mixed reviews, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" has since been considered to be the Rolling Stones' best work while being ranked on various lists as one of the greatest albums of all time. - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove. What is the relationship between 'some girls ' and 'the rolling stones'?

Options: - gas station - power engines - burn hot - fuel tank - car Explain why a human would choose \\"car\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"car\\" as the answer to the question \\"What do you use petrol to power?\\" because it represents the most direct and relatable example of a device that typically uses petrol as a source of energy. First, let's explore the other options given: - Gas station: A gas station is a place where petrol is stored and sold to consumers rather than an object that is powered by petrol. While gas stations may use small amounts of petrol for maintenance tasks or generators, their primary function is to distribute petrol to vehicles. - Power engines: While this option is not incorrect, it is a more general term that encompasses various types of engines that may use petrol for power generation. An engine is a device that converts the chemical energy from fuel (such as petrol) into mechanical energy. However, this option does not specify a particular type of powered device, as engines can be found in a variety of applications. - Burn hot: Petrol does indeed burn hot when ignited, but this phrase doesn't describe a specific object or application of petrol. Rather, it highlights one of the characteristics of petrol. - Fuel tank: A fuel tank is a container that stores petrol for later use, but it does not use or consume petrol. It merely holds the fuel until it's required by an engine or another device. On the other hand, a car is an object that typically relies on petrol as a primary energy source to power its internal combustion engine (ICE). The petrol stored in the fuel tank is pumped into the engine, where it is combined with air, compressed, and then ignited, generating mechanical energy that drives the pistons and, ultimately, propels the car forward. A car is a widely recognized and commonly used mode of transportation for billions of people around the world. The vast majority of cars on the roads today are petrol-powered, making them a primary consumer of this fuel. Therefore, the human would likely choose \\"car\\" as the most relevant and easily understood example of an object powered by petrol. This answer also highlights the broader applications of petrol-powered vehicles, which are not limited to cars alone. Petrol is used to power various other forms of transportation, such as motorcycles, boats, and some small aircraft. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"car\\" to answer the question \\"What do you use petrol to power?\\" because it represents a specific, widely recognized, and commonly experienced application of petrol as an energy source for transportation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who had ten more children with his third wife? is inside the article: Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Question: What is the nutitional value to humans of poultry and poultry products? Is \\"Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, \\"Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality.\\" is a correct answer, but it can be elaborated further to provide more details. Here are the steps I would follow to explain the nutritional value of poultry and poultry products to humans: Step 1: Define poultry and poultry products Poultry includes chicken, turkey, duck, and other farmed birds used for their meat and eggs. Poultry products include the meat itself, as well as eggs and other by-products like liver and giblets. Step 2: Identify key nutrients in poultry and poultry products Poultry meat and poultry products are rich sources of nutrients essential for human health, including: 1. High-quality protein: Necessary for the growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues. Poultry provides complete protein, containing all the essential amino acids needed by our body. 2. B vitamins: Poultry meat and eggs contain various B vitamins, including B2, B3, B6, and B12, which help support energy metabolism, brain function, and the formation of red blood cells. 3. Minerals: Poultry meat and eggs contain minerals such as iron (heme-iron, which is more easily absorbed by the body), zinc, selenium, and phosphorus, which are essential for various biological functions, including immune system support, antioxidant activity, and bone health. 4. Unsaturated fats: Although poultry contains saturated fats, it also contains unsaturated fats such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, which may support heart health when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Step 3: Mention the nutritional differences of various poultry types Different types of poultry may provide slightly different nutrient profiles. For example, duck and goose meat are higher in fat compared to chicken and turkey. Also, dark meat (legs and thighs) of poultry contains more fat and calories than white meat (breast). Step 4: Summarize the benefits of poultry consumption in a human diet In summary, poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein, various vitamins and minerals, and unsaturated fats.

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\", answer the following question.

This outcome demonstrates the empathy and shared values ingrained within the community. In this community, members recognize the importance of prioritizing health and well-being over leisure pursuits and personal experiences. The choice to allocate more resources to combat the disease indicates that the community members were more driven to make a difference in the lives of those affected by the illness. When faced with the choice between supporting a cause that has a direct impact on the lives of community members and one that offers an enjoyable and perhaps memorable experience for a few individuals, the decision to prioritize the former reflects the group's solidarity, understanding, and ethical values. The collective response of the community to stand up against a potentially life-affecting issue can serve as an example to others, emphasizing the importance of choosing to support and invest in efforts that can have a lasting, life-changing impact. Moreover, the community's choice to focus on the disease demonstrates a long-term vision and a deeper understanding of the potential ripple effects of a widespread health crisis. Recognizing that diseases can have far-reaching economic and social impacts, the community members chose to put their efforts and resources into ensuring a healthier future for all who may be affected. It is worth noting that the decision to allocate more funds to the disease does not completely devalue the significance of the trip. Personal experiences, travel, and cultural exchanges can be extremely beneficial for personal growth and broader understanding of the world. However, when presented with the dilemma between addressing a substantial health issue and a trip, the community members understand that their priority should be the well-being of their fellow members. The community’s actions in this scenario serve as a potent reminder of the importance of empathy, compassion, and collective decision-making to support those in need. The choice to contribute more to the disease than the trip underscores the role that every individual can play in fostering a more supportive and inclusive community.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops. I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.

The laws are uncoordinated. 2. The laws are often inconsistent. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"The laws are usually inconsistent and uncoordinated.\\" To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to see if the conditions in the hypothesis hold, given the truth of the premise. 1. The hypothesis states that the laws are \\"usually inconsistent.\\" The premise states the laws are \\"often inconsistent.\\" The terms \\"usually\\" and \\"often\\" might have slightly different degrees but can be considered similar enough in meaning to determine that this part of the hypothesis is supported by the premise. 2. The hypothesis states that the laws are \\"uncoordinated.\\" This is the same as the first part of the premise. Since both parts of the hypothesis are supported by the premise, we can conclude that the premise does entail the hypothesis - \\"The laws are usually inconsistent and uncoordinated\\" - given that the premise is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.

For this sentence, we split it into three parts: The primary event, the prior event, and the failure. 1. \\"Moreover, the Syrian uprising has come on the heels of\\" is translated as \\"Ayrıca, Suriye ayaklanması hemen ardından gelmiştir\\". In English, \\"on the heels of\\" is an idiom that means 'right after'. In Turkish, we express this as \\"hemen ardından gelmek\\" which directly translates to 'to come right after'. 2. \\"Iran's own brutal suppression of protestors following the 2009 presidential elections\\" corresponds to \\"2009 başkanlık seçimlerinin ardından İran'ın kendi protestocularına karşı acımasız baskısı\\". The phrase structure in Turkish differs from English. So, the timeframe \\"following the 2009 presidential elections\\" is moved to the beginning of the clause. 3. \\"and the failure of its economic model.\\" is translated as \\"ve ekonomik modelinin başarısızlığı\\". In Turkish, the possessive form is used differently. Thus \\"its economic model's failure\\" translates to \\"ekonomik modelinin başarısızlığı\\". The word \\"its\\" is signified by the suffix \\"-nin\\". \\"Başarısızlık\\" means \\"failure\\" and \\"ekonomik model\\" is \\"economic model\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists have discovered a classified document from an ancient archive, revealing the existence of Earth-Prime – a term that refers to Earth's initial version before it underwent numerous temporal alterations by time-travelers. Dr. Evelyn Harris, a renowned physicist and expert on time-travel, leads an international team of scientists to uncover the dark past of Earth-Prime. They develop a prototype time machine called the \\"ChronoSphere,\\" capable of traveling back to Earth-Prime's era as they seek to uncover the hidden history of Earth and perhaps save it from the imminent catastrophe. Upon their first temporal jump, they find themselves in an alternate version of the year 1900. Earth-Prime is a pristine, sustainable world with an advanced civilization that has managed to strike a balance between technology and nature. The team learns that the time-travelers who came before them were actually villainous agents hunting for an ancient artifact known as the \\"Genesis Paradox,\\" a mysterious device with the power to reshape reality itself. The agents intend to return to their own time and use the Genesis Paradox to establish a tyrannical regime over Earth's alternate timelines, erasing all resistance and creating an eternal dystopia. Dr. Harris and her team must race against time to locate the Genesis Paradox before the agents can get their hands on it and protect Earth-Prime from suffering the same fate as their own dying world. As the thrilling adventure unfolds, Dr. Harris and her team face numerous challenges in Earth-Prime, discovering forgotten technological wonders, engaging in epic battles, and forging alliances with Earth-Prime's inhabitants, who possess extraordinary abilities. In the process, they learn valuable lessons about what went wrong in their own timeline and how they can correct their mistakes to save Earth. In the climactic battle, Dr. Harris and her team confront the evil agents, who have managed to locate the Genesis Paradox. With the help of their newfound allies, they defeat the agents and secure the device – but not without great sacrifice. With a heavy heart, Dr. Harris uses the Genesis Paradox to repair the damage done to the timelines, giving Earth another chance and restoring Earth-Prime as its original state in history. The team returns to their own time, finding Earth revitalized and on the path to environmental recovery. Inspired by their adventure and the lessons learned in Earth-Prime, humanity unites to preserve their world and its future. The Earth-Prime legacy lives on as a reminder that a sustainable future is possible when we learn from our past mistakes and work together for a better tomorrow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Part #2: \\"twice\\" and \\"thrice\\" Usage: [command] twice, [command] thrice This means the command will be executed two times (twice) or three times (thrice). In the given command, \\"jump twice\\" will execute the action I_JUMP two times, and \\"turn opposite right thrice\\" will execute the sequence of actions related to \\"turn opposite right\\" three times. Part #3: \\"turn opposite\\" Usage: turn opposite [direction] This means the agent will turn backward in a specified direction (left or right). In the given command, \\"turn opposite right\\" means the agent will turn 180 degrees to face the opposite direction, but with a right turn. The action will be a combination of two I_TURN_RIGHT actions since each I_TURN_RIGHT is a 90-degree turn. Based on the analysis above, the sequence of actions for the command \\"turn opposite right thrice after jump twice\\" would be: I_JUMP, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, get all the terms with f on one side of the equation. To do this, you can add f to both sides of the equation. Doing this will help you eliminate the -f on the right side of the equation. -5f + f = -f + f + 16 Which simplifies to: -4f = 16 2. Now, to get the value of f, you need to isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by -4. -4f / -4 = 16 / -4 3. When you simplify the equation, you will find the value of f: f = -4 So, the solution for the equation -5f = -f + 16 is f = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was once dating this girl from college who showed genuine interest in me and for that and many other reasons, I really liked her. Well, you could say I loved her. We had been together for a week. One day, we went on a trip. It was all fun and games and laughing. I had the best time of my life. We were walking on the beach of a lake during sunset. We were talking and suddenly, I felt her tone getting more and more depressed. At some point, she concluded that “we need to take a break.” Trying to understand her arguments for that, the break turned into a breakup.

I spent weeks reliving this day, especially the conversation on the beach, and trying to figure out where it went wrong. I even got into an episode of mania.

Several weeks into the breakup, I decided, with the aid of my friends, that I have to move on. To be honest, I relapsed a lot. One time, I actually sat down with her and said I still have feelings for her. What really helped me to get out of this was the thing I hated the most at that time: taking a break. I avoided her, in real life and on social media, and eventually, I forgot that she even existed. I developed new hobbies and made new friends. Now, I healed properly and we’re back to being friends (Yes, it’s possible to stay friends with your ex).

Although it is not fully explained, the Woman is the last remaining member of a human cannibalistic native american tribe that has roamed the north-east coast for decades (as seen in the 2009 film Offspring).Chris Cleek (Sean Bridgers) is a country lawyer who is shown at a local BBQ with his family. The family enjoys BBQ while the oldest daughter Peggy (Lauren Ashley Carter) sits off to the side clearly detached and upset. Their only son Brian Cleek (Zach Rand) watches as three or four boys violate and push a small girl into a corner. He stands up seemingly to come to her aid, but instead shoots a basketball. As they leave, Chris asks his son how it was to which Brian replies that he shot 9 out of 10 baskets. There is no mention of the girl or anything else.Later that night while out hunting, Chris happens upon the Woman who is bathing in a nearby stream. He watches her, leaves, and returns later with a net in an effort to capture her. He manages to trap the Woman in the net and knocks her out.

Engaging with readers (and an expert) in a comment thread It's always great to see readers weigh in on our stories in the comments section posted beside each of our pieces. But when I wrote a front-page take-out about race and school discipline in late December, the comments arrived in an online torrent. By 9 a.m., with more than 2,000 posted, an editor asked me to jump in. The idea was that I could pose questions, build on ideas — basically engage thoughtful remarks and help facilitate a discussion that our readers seemed to want to have. In a sense, it was like an online chat. I introduced myself and asked readers about the merits of kicking kids out of school. A commenting badge appeared with my comments, identifying me a Washington Post staffer. I mentioned the trends in our local area. I added some material about the latest research, which had been cut from the final version of my story because the piece was too long for the allotted space. It was a heated and fast-moving debate. I decided pretty quickly that it might help to bring in one of the experts I had quoted in my story. After all, I'd spent a couple of weeks on my piece. But Dan Losen, of UCLA, had recently authored a report on racial disparities for the National Education Policy Center, at University of Colorado, and spent much of his career studying the issue. As it turned out, Losen had time that day, agreed to participate and offered comments on and off for a few hours. I think he posted half a dozen lengthy replies and observations. He pointed to research evidence from Harvard about racial bias, for example. He cited data from discipline studies in Texas and Indiana. He responded in detail to concerns and doubts about the implications of racial disparities. Afterward, our online engagement team thought this set-up might be a model for future stories: Why not bring some of the people behind our journalism into the reader discussion that typically follows publication? That way, our readers gain access to people with whom they don't ordinarily get to exchange ideas. It might deepen the experience of reading and commenting; it might enrich the back-and-forth.

Question: How long has Dean been working at the Shenaneganz Title: Waiting... Movie plot: The film focuses on several characters. One of the main protagonists, Dean (Justin Long), has been a waiter at a restaurant called Shenaniganz for four years since graduating from high school, and has not earned a degree during his four years at a community college. When Dean learns from his mother that a former high school classmate, Chett (Travis Resor), now has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, he begins to rethink his direction-less life. Dean's friend and co-worker, Monty (Ryan Reynolds), is in exactly the same situation, but has accepted that his future lies with the restaurant. Monty is put in charge of training Mitch (John Francis Daley), a newly hired waiter who is constantly interrupted throughout most of the film before he can speak, usually by Monty. Also working with Dean is Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), a hopeless romantic who cannot urinate in public, and Dan (David Koechner), the uptight manager who is grooming Dean as his protÃ©gÃ©. Rounding out the staff are 17-year-old hostess Natasha (Vanessa Lengies), abrasive waitress Naomi (Alanna Ubach), waitress (and Monty's ex-girlfriend) Serena (Anna Faris), Dean's girlfriend and fellow waitress Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), stoner busboys T-Dog and Nick (Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis), head chef Raddamus (Luis Guzman), the insane, unsanitary chef Floyd (Dane Cook), lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the pensive and philosophical dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride). The waiters preoccupy themselves with endless gossip, complaining about the customers, seeking covert revenge on particularly rude or annoying patrons, and playing a special kind of game which involves flashing genitalia at a fellow worker (the \\"Penis Showing Game\\"). Each employee has his or her own problems and stories, which are interwoven with the ebb and flow of business. A common phrase used throughout the film, which is referred to in the Shenaniganz training video is \\"The only thing different between extraordinary and ordinary, is that little bit of extra!\\"...

Information: - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In chemistry, pH (potential of hydrogen) is a numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. It is approximately the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration, measured in units of moles per liter, of hydrogen ions. More precisely it is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the hydrogen ion. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Pure water is neutral, at pH 7, being neither an acid nor a base. Contrary to popular belief, the pH value can be less than 0 or greater than 14 for very strong acids and bases respectively. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number. In simple cases the logarithm counts factors in multiplication. For example, the base logarithm of is , as to the power is; 10 is used as a factor three times. More generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so the logarithm can be calculated for any two positive real numbers and where is not equal to . The logarithm of to \\"base\\" , denoted , is the unique real number such that For example, as , then: - Petroleum (from : \\"rock\\" + \\"oleum\\": \\"oil\\". ) is a naturally occurring, yellow-to-black liquid found in geological formations beneath the Earth's surface, which is commonly refined into various types of fuels. Components of petroleum are separated using a technique called fractional distillation. - Sunset Yellow FCF ( also known as Orange Yellow S , or C.I. 15985 ) is a petroleum - derived orange azo dye with a pH dependent maximum absorption at about 480 nm at pH 1 and 443 nm at pH 13 with a shoulder at 500 nm . When added to foods sold in the US it is known as FD&C Yellow 6 ; when sold in Europe , it is denoted by E Number E110 . - Fractional distillation is the separation of a mixture into its component parts, or fractions, separating chemical compounds by their boiling point by heating them to a temperature at which one or more fractions of the compound will vaporize. It uses distillation to fractionate. Generally the component parts have boiling points that differ by less than 25 °C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere. If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25 °C, a simple distillation is typically used. - A hydrogen ion is created when a hydrogen atom loses or gains an electron. A lone positively charged hydrogen ion (or proton) can readily combine with other particles and therefore is only seen isolated when it is in a gaseous state or a nearly particle free space. Due to its extremely high charge density of approximately 2×10 times that of a sodium ion, the bare hydrogen ion cannot exist freely in solution as it readily hydrates, i.e., bonds quickly. The hydrogen ion is recommended by IUPAC as a general term for all ions of hydrogen and its isotopes. Depending on the charge of the ion, two different classes can be distinguished: positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. - Distillation is a process of separating the component or substances from a liquid mixture by selective evaporation and condensation. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components of the mixture. In either case the process exploits differences in the volatility of the mixture's components. In industrial chemistry, distillation is a unit operation of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process and not a chemical reaction. - A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth. Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container. Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed. Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density. A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena. - A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then attaches to the fabric or tissue. It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French \\"mordre\\", \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion. The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. - Molar concentration, also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration, is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume. A commonly used unit for molar concentration used in chemistry is mol/L. A solution of concentration 1 mol/L is also denoted as 1 molar (1 ). - A dye is a colored substance that has an affinity to the substrate to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber. - Fiber or fibre (from the Latin fibra) is a natural or synthetic substance that is significantly longer than it is wide. Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example carbon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Oleum (Latin \\"oleum\\" = \\"oil\\"), or fuming sulfuric acid, is a solution of various compositions of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid, or sometimes more specifically to disulfuric acid (also known as pyrosulfuric acid). Oleum is idenfied by the CAS number 8014-95-7. - In computer science, ACID (\\"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability\\") is a set of properties of database transactions. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction. - E numbers are codes for substances that are permitted to be used as food additives for use within the European Union and Switzerland. The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Europe\\". Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that provides independent scientific advice and communicates on existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain.

This article: The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some... contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture?, what is it ?","completion":"The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Brown.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City.

Article:It was Tuesday - a day considered holy by many Hindus - and we approached a popular temple in blistering heat. We headed towards a huge cow shelter in the basement of the temple. Dildar Hussain Beg told me he visited the temple every Tuesday after offering prayers in the nearby mosque to look after more than two dozen cows. \\"I have been coming here for more than 10 years and these cows are my family. I also visit several other cow shelters regularly,\\" he said. But Mr Beg does not just visit cows, he also protects them. Along with a few of his neighbours, Mr Beg has formed a small organisation called Muslim Gauraksha Dal (Muslim Cow Protectors) and is trying to \\"educate\\" members of his community to stop eating beef. \\"Cow protectors\\" in India have been in the news for a series of assaults on people transporting cows. Many of the attacks have been against Muslims, while the cow protection squads are overwhelmingly Hindu. The cow is considered sacred by Hindus and killing the animal is illegal in several states. But beef is eaten in other communities, including by Muslims, in India. Mr Beg is among a small group of Muslims who run shelters to look after cows. Generations of some Muslim families have also looked after cows in shelters owned by Hindus. \\"My community has been constantly accused of indulging in cow slaughter in India. If Muslims don't come forward and renounce cow-slaughter, who else will?\\" he says. Besides working regularly in this cow shelter, he says he travels extensively to other parts of the country to \\"sensitise his community against cow slaughter and abolish the practice of eating cow meat\\". He says he has held camps in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to spread awareness and, like many other Hindu cow vigilantes, he claims to have informed local police about the illegal transportation of cows in and around Delhi. He denies that he is doing this for \\"publicity\\". \\"I don't believe in any political party and even fought the last parliamentary election as an independent candidate. People from my own community did mock me initially when I urged them to abstain from cow meat but we don't care,\\" he says. His family supports his cause. Mr Beg's wife, Shaheen Begum, says initially his idea of becoming a cow protector came as a surprise. \\"I probably took the least time to agree with his cause because I never liked eating beef and always preferred chicken or fish,\\" she said. But reactions from other relatives have been mixed. \\"Most of the people in our circle don't eat cow meat. A few people initially asked why he attends cow-protection workshops. But nobody asks about it anymore,\\" she said. \\"Some feel he is trying to grab attention but then step back when they hear that he promotes buffalo meat or lamb as a form of nutrition instead of cow.\\" India has seen an alarming rise in incidents related to cow vigilantism, more so after the Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in 2014. In 2015 a Muslim man was lynched for allegedly storing and consuming beef. At least half a dozen attacks on people transporting cows have been reported across the country. Opposition parties have been scathing in their criticism, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to criticise such vigilantes, saying they made him \\"angry\\". But this appears to have had very little impact on the ground. Most recently, a group of Muslim dairy farmers were beaten on a national highway, allegedly by cow vigilantes, for transporting cows from a cattle fair. One of the victims, a 55-year-old man, later died in hospital. In a recent report Human Rights Watch urged action against those responsible for such attacks. \\"Self-appointed cow protestors driven by irresponsible populism are killing people and terrorising minority communities,\\" the organisation's South Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly said. But Mr Beg believes that Muslims too can prevent the situation from escalating. \\"It's very simple. If the majority community in my country is uncomfortable with us eating cow, why do it?\\" \\"I have no problems at all with Muslims eating buffalo meat and encourage them to do so. But we are a minority community and have to be considerate towards Hindus who are in the majority. \\"If they consider cows holy, why kill it? That too when buffalo meat is legally available,\\" he explains.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: United States, language, English language; Angola, Indiana, country, United States. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The given data provides a mixture of information related to language, geographical locations, and political entities. Specifically, it highlights the United States, a country in North America, as well as the English language, which is predominantly spoken in that region. Additionally, Angola is mentioned in two distinct contexts – as a separate African nation and as a town in Indiana, United States. Here is a detailed description of each component of the given data: 1. United States: The United States of America (USA) is a prominent country situated in North America, which comprises 50 states, a federal district, and multiple territories. The USA, extending over 9.8 million square kilometers (3.8 million square miles), is the third-largest country in the world as per land area and population size. With a federal democratic structure, power is divided between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, led by the President, Congress, and Supreme Court, respectively. Several factors distinguish the USA on a global platform, such as a strong economy, advanced technology, higher education, and considerable cultural influence. It's also well-known for its diverse climate, landscapes, and natural wonders, such as the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, and the Great Lakes. 2. Language: Language is the primary method of human communication, which can be expressed verbally or in written forms. Languages comprise a collection of words, symbols, and grammatical rules that enable individuals to interact with one another and share information. Today, there are approximately 7,000 spoken languages worldwide, varying greatly in terms of syntax, grammar, and lexicon. 3. English Language: Originating from the Anglo-Frisian dialects spoken in England, English has now evolved into a major global language. With approximately 1.5 billion speakers, it ranks third in terms of native speakers and second as a commonly learned second language. English is an official language in many countries and serves as the primary medium for international business, diplomacy, academe, and technological communication. The global significance of the English language is partly due to the historical expansion of the British Empire and the rapid economic growth and cultural dominance of the United States in the 20th century. 4. Angola: Angola, situated in Southern Africa, is a vast nation spanning over 1.2 million square kilometers (481,400 square miles). Its population is estimated at around 32 million, representing various ethnic groups, such as the Ovimbundu, Kimbundu, and Bakongo. The official language spoken here is Portuguese, a remnant of the European colonizers' influence. Angola has a rich cultural history and abundant natural resources, including oil, gold, diamonds, and arable land. The country has faced numerous challenges in its modern history, including a prolonged armed struggle for independence (from Portugal) and a lengthy civil war. 5. Indiana: A Midwestern state in the United States, Indiana is recognized for its diversified economy, including manufacturing, agriculture, and technology sectors. Some nicknames for Indiana are the \\"Hoosier State\\" and \\"Crossroads of America\\" due to the many interstate highways passing through it, connecting eastern and western regions. 6. Angola, Indiana: Angola is a small city in northeastern Indiana, located in Steuben County, with a population of around 8,600 people. It serves as the county seat and is in close proximity to numerous lakes, making it a popular destination for recreational activities. While Angola, Indiana, shares its name with the African nation of Angola, they are unrelated in terms of history and culture. In conclusion, the given data presents a snapshot of diverse information that encompasses different aspects of the world, from language and nations to towns in the United States. These connections show the multi-dimensional and interconnected nature of global knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the final step of the following process: - Cells obtain glucose and oxygen - The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide - The cells release energy - The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this - The cells obtain more oxygen from the air A:","completion":"The final step of the aforementioned process is the efficient utilization of the newly obtained oxygen to continue with cellular respiration and energy production. I will outline this process in more detail below. 1. Cells obtain glucose and oxygen: Cells obtain glucose primarily through the food consumed by an organism. The glucose is then transported via the bloodstream to the cells. Oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system and is transported via the blood, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, eventually reaching the cells. 2. The glucose and oxygen create carbon dioxide: Within the cells, glucose and oxygen are utilized in a series of biochemical reactions known as cellular respiration. This process takes place in the mitochondria and has several steps: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. These reactions ultimately lead to the production of carbon dioxide, water, and a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 3. The cells release energy: The primary purpose of cellular respiration is to generate ATP, which serves as the cell's energy currency. ATP provides the energy required for various cellular processes, such as growth, repair, and maintenance. 4. The cells don't have enough oxygen to repeat this: If oxygen levels are insufficient for the continuation of cellular respiration, cells must resort to alternative methods of producing ATP. One such method, anaerobic respiration or fermentation, does not require oxygen and is less efficient than aerobic respiration. In muscle cells, for example, this process results in the production of lactic acid, which can lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. 5. The cells obtain more oxygen from the air: To resume the more efficient, oxygen-dependent cellular respiration, cells require a continuous supply of oxygen. In response to decreased oxygen levels, the respiratory rate may increase to provide more oxygen to the cells. This is possible due to the intricate coordination between the respiratory and circulatory systems, which work to deliver oxygen to every cell in the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the cells efficiently using the freshly obtained oxygen to continue with cellular respiration and ATP production. This is essential for maintaining cellular function, growth, and repair within the organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the exact title of the diploma piece without which Etty could not become a Royal Academician? is inside the article: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable..., can you guess it ?

Should I be talkative or stay cool when meeting girls?","completion":"Although the two questions have some similarities in terms of expressing uncertainty about how to behave during a meeting, their meanings are distinct and pertain to different scenarios. Let's examine them one by one. 1. \\"Should he stay in a hotel when we meet?\\" This question seeks advice on the suitability of someone staying in a hotel when they come for a meeting. The context could involve a business gathering or a personal rendezvous, where the person asking the question wants to make sure that the hotel stay is appropriate for the situation. They could be considering alternative lodging options, e.g., staying with a local or at a rental property, but they are not sure whether those alternatives offer the desired balance between comfort, convenience, and propriety. 2. \\"Should I be talkative or stay cool when meeting girls?\\" This question focuses on social interactions, particularly when meeting girls, and seeks guidance on exhibiting the right balance of talkativeness and relaxed demeanor. The question assumes that being too talkative might seem overbearing or annoying, while staying too \\"cool\\" could come across as aloof or unapproachable. The person asking the question wonders whether they should actively engage in conversation with the girls, expressing their thoughts and opinions, or maintain a more restrained, potentially mysterious presence. In summary, while both questions share some similarities in expressing uncertainty and seeking advice about how to act in a meeting scenario, they are not the same. The first question concerns the choice of accommodation for someone visiting for a meeting, whereas the second question addresses the dilemma of choosing an appropriate level of talkativeness during social interactions with girls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Rammstein (German pronunciation: ['RamStaIn]) is a German Neue Deutsche Harte band, formed in 1994 in Berlin. Throughout its existence, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unchanged--lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, bassist Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Riedel, drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider, lead vocalist Till Lindemann, rhythm guitarist Paul H. Landers, and keyboardist Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz. The band helped to found a subgenre within German hard rock and metal that became known as Neue Deutsche Harte. The majority of their songs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages including English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. \\"Engel\\", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named Engel - Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs, \\"Feuerrader\\" and \\"Wilder Wein\\". Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was \\"Du hast\\", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both Sehnsucht singles (\\"Du hast\\" and \\"Engel\\") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In August 1998, the band released a cover of the song Stripped, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album For the Masses, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria. On 22-23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status there on November 2. The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed \\"Du hast\\" live on 12 November that year. Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts.

Kenneth was considered a negative individual compared to Matthew, due to Kenneth always being pessimistic. While both of them faced similar situations in their lives, their way of responding to these challenges greatly differed. Kenneth had a tendency to look at the downside of every situation, diminishing the prospect of success, and focusing on the potential for failure and disappointment. This negative outlook often discouraged those around him, making it harder for Kenneth to maintain meaningful connections and relationships. On the other hand, Matthew was known for his positive attitude and ability to see the silver lining in every cloud. He wholeheartedly believed that with determination and hard work, individuals could overcome any obstacle and achieve their goals. Matthew's optimism was contagious, and it inspired and encouraged those around him to strive for success, resulting in a harmonious and supportive network of friends and colleagues. Despite their contrasting perspectives, Kenneth and Matthew remained close friends, each learning valuable lessons from the other. Kenneth's pessimism sometimes helped to keep the overly optimistic Matthew grounded in reality while recognizing the pitfalls that lay ahead. Conversely, Matthew's optimism shone a light on the possibilities that Kenneth's pessimism obscured, allowing for a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the world around them for both individuals. As time went on, their relationship continued to grow, and they began to appreciate the diverse viewpoints they each brought to the table. They learned that neither of them was entirely right nor entirely wrong; instead, it was their unique outlooks that provided a comprehensive lens through which to view and navigate life's challenges. In the end, while Kenneth was considered a negative individual compared to Matthew because of his pessimistic nature, their friendship forged a balanced and enriching partnership that nurtured personal growth and understanding. By embracing and learning from their differences, the two friends discovered that optimism and pessimism could coexist, ultimately leading to a more profound understanding of themselves and the world around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

About 2,000 troops have been allocated to Zipingpu, trying to release the pressure through spillway. In total, 391 dams, most of them small, were reported damaged by the quake.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"To travel from the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant to the Tulong reservoir, one would presumably follow a route along the river connecting the two locations. Since the Tulong reservoir is upstream from the Hydropower Plant, it would indicate that you're going in the right direction. It is important to note that due to the damages sustained by both the Hydropower Plant and the reservoir during the earthquake, potential hazards and challenges might be encountered. Considering the possibility of infrastructure damage, there are a few travel options: 1. Road Transportation: If road infrastructure is still intact and safe to use, you could travel by car, truck, or any other land-based vehicle suitable for the local terrain. You may need to check for available routes and their safety, possibly consulting local authorities about the status of the roads. 2. River Transportation: If the river conditions allow and water transportation is available, you could use a boat or barge to travel from the Hydropower Plant to the Tulong reservoir. This option might be advantageous for transporting equipment or heavy loads that are needed for the repair works or relief efforts. 3. Air Transportation: If both road and river transportation are not feasible, and the distance justifies it, helicopter transportation could be a viable option to reach the Tulong reservoir. Additionally, helicopters might prove beneficial for aerial inspections of the damaged infrastructure and could help deploy emergency personnel, if needed. Additionally, considering that 2,000 troops had been allocated to the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant to release pressure through the spillway, it is suggested to coordinate with them for guidance on the safest and most efficient travel route from the plant to the Tulong reservoir. Whichever method you choose, the priority should always be safety due to the unstable and damaged infrastructure as a result of the earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens A:","completion":"A: The final step of the described process is when the energy derived from the steam is efficiently utilized to perform mechanical work or electrical generation. Here's a detailed description of the whole process: 1. A fuel, typically coal, gas, or biomass, is heated in an oven or furnace, which produces a high amount of thermal energy. 2. Above the oven is a closed/sealed tank containing water, which is heated by the thermal energy coming from the furnace. 3. As the water in the tank continues to be heated, it reaches its boiling point and begins to evaporate, transforming into high-pressure steam. 4. Steam, being denser than air, needs a space to escape, and therefore it is forced out of the tank. 5. The escaping steam enters a piston that is part of a steam engine or turbine system. The high pressure of the steam will force the piston to move upwards. 6. As the first piston reaches its highest point, the valve closes, trapping the steam inside the piston chamber. 7. At this moment, the valve on the next piston opens, allowing the steam to flow from the first piston chamber into the second piston chamber. 8. The high-pressure steam now causes the second piston to move, transferring the force and mechanical energy. The final step in this process is to harness the mechanical energy generated by the movement of the pistons (steam engine or turbine) in the most effective way possible. This can be achieved by: a. Direct mechanical work: Connecting the steam engine or turbine to an array of mechanical devices or machines, such as rotating shafts, gears, or flywheels. This can enable various types of industrial or transport equipment to perform tasks, such as milling, cutting, pumping, or driving vehicles like locomotives or ships. b. Electrical power generation: Converting the mechanical energy into electrical energy by coupling the steam engine or turbine to an electrical generator. When the pistons or turbine blades move, they rotate the generator's shaft, which then transforms the mechanical movement into electrical energy via electromagnetic induction. This electricity can then be transmitted and distributed to power residential, commercial, and industrial applications, or even used for charging electric vehicles. In conclusion, the final step in this process is to efficiently utilize the energy derived from the steam either for direct mechanical work or electrical power generation, essentially transforming a heat source into something that performs useful work or supplies energy to various applications in a sustainable and efficient manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"b).\\" movie review (pick from the following. a). negative b). positive).","completion":"Title: The Little Things (2021) Director: John Lee Hancock Genre: Crime, Drama, Thriller Rating: ★★★★★ b) Positive Review: \\"The Little Things\\" is a brilliantly crafted crime drama that transports viewers to the unsettling landscape of a thrill-driven, late 1990s Los Angeles. Director John Lee Hancock has ingeniously weaved a tale of mystery, guilt, and self-reflection, all underscored by the relentless pursuit of justice. Denzel Washington leads a stellar cast with absolute finesse as Joe \\"Deke\\" Deacon, a shrewd, introverted Kern County Deputy who is drawn, almost serendipitously, into a series of murders bearing an uncanny resemblance to an unresolved case from his past. Washington's portrayal of Deke is mesmerizing, with his masterful ability to convey the character's inner turmoil through the subtlest of expressions - a furrowed brow, a lingering gaze - alluding to a man tormented by past mistakes. Rami Malek's performance as the ambitious LA detective, Jim Baxter, is equally compelling, offering a stark contrast to his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Malek delivers a complex character, bringing together the conflicting aspects of Baxter's personality - his ambitious drive, fragile arrogance, and thirst for redemption - as he wrestles with a case that seems perpetually out of grasp. The undeniable show-stealer, however, is the chilling performance of Jared Leto as the elusive, eccentric prime suspect, Albert Sparma. Leto's reinvention as this slim and enigmatic loner is nothing short of captivating, balancing the character's eerie intelligence and veiled menace with moments of dark humor and unexpected empathy. The film's pacing is calculated and deliberate, adding to the overall sense of unease as the case unfolds. A remarkable feat of filmmaking, \\"The Little Things\\" does not rely on gimmicky jump scares or graphic violence to unnerve its viewers. Instead, it ventures deep into the psychology of human nature, steering the audience to confront the unsettling truths lurking in our collective human id. The cinematography, with its dark shadows draped over sprawling cityscapes, echoes the style of a classic neo-noir, further enshrouding us in a cloak of moral ambiguity. Moreover, the score composed by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the visual narrative, combining earthy dissonance with haunting melodies that gradually build tension and enhance the atmosphere. In spite of the dark thematic elements, \\"The Little Things\\" does not fail to provide moments of catharsis and redemption, as the multi-layered characters wrestle with their pasts and face the full spectrum of their humanity - sometimes flawed, but always deeply resonating. \\"The Little Things\\" offers an intense viewing experience, thoughtfully capturing the fragility of the human condition and our perpetual struggle between good and evil. Joined by the exceptional talents of Washington, Malek, and Leto, this film is a testament to the power of great storytelling, and it is sure to leave audiences questioning their own moral compass long after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of crime drama and psychological thrillers alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Inside, Captain Spaulding is having a conversation with an old decrepit local man named Stucky (Michael J. Pollard) over a topless autographed photo of June Wilkinson and about the local simpleton who works down the road. When Stucky goes to the nearby restroom, two masked thugs break into the gas station/museum, who for some reason thought it was a good idea to rob a store obviously run by psychopaths. As the two men hold Stucky and Spaulding at gunpoint, the tough-talking lead thug, named Killer Karl, demands that Spaulding hand over the cash register, while the other thug, whom is clearly mentally retarded, holds Stucky back.

Q:Process: - Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin - The cans are transported to a facility - The cans are shredded by a machine - The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them - The molten metal is poured into molds - The molds are flattened and rolled into sheets to reuse. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more miners happens, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The given process involves the following steps: 1. Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin 2. The cans are transported to a facility 3. The cans are shredded by a machine 4. The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them 5. The molten metal is poured into molds 6. The molds are flattened and rolled into sheets to reuse. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose there are more miners, how will it affect LESS aluminum cans being recycled? Now we need to consider if the perturbation (increase in the number of miners) has any direct or indirect effect on the aluminum can recycling process. Step 1: More miners would not directly affect the act of putting aluminum cans into a recycle bin. However, indirectly, increasing the number of miners could potentially lead to more aluminum being extracted from the earth, making it more readily available and possibly reducing the incentive to recycle. Step 2: The transportation of cans to a facility would also not be directly affected by the number of miners. Indirectly, if the availability of aluminum increases, the demand for recycled aluminum might decline, consequently reducing the number of cans transported to recycling facilities. Step 3: The process of shredding the cans by a machine remains unaffected directly by the increase in miners. Indirectly, the possible decrease in demand for recycled aluminum might reduce the amount of cans being shredded. Step 4: Similarly, heating the cans to melt them would not be directly affected by more miners. However, if less aluminum cans end up being recycled due to changes in demand and supply, fewer cans would be heated to 1400 degrees. Step 5: Pouring the molten metal into molds is also not directly affected by the increase in miners. The indirect effect depends on the changes in the demand for recycled aluminum, which may lead to less molten metal produced and poured into molds. Step 6: Finally, the flattening and rolling of molds into sheets to reuse would not be directly affected by the increase in miners. Indirectly, if the previous steps are affected due to changes in aluminum supply and demand, the number of molds flattened and rolled into sheets would also be reduced. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (increase in the number of miners) does not directly affect the aluminum can recycling process. However, it could have indirect effects on the process by potentially increasing the supply of aluminum and reducing the incentives to recycle, which in turn may lead to fewer aluminum cans being recycled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics. - Stepanavan, is a town in the Lori Province of Armenia. It is located 139 km north of the capital Yerevan and 24 km north of the provincial centre Vanadzor, in the centre of Yerevan-Tbilisi highway. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 13,086. Due to its location on the shores of Dzoraget River among the forest of Lori plateau and Bazum mountains, Stepanavan is considered a resort town in northern Armenia. - Akhtala; also known as Pghindzavank (meaning \\"Coppermine Monastery\\") is a 10th-century fortified Armenian Apostolic Church monastery located in the town of Akhtala in the marz of Lori, north of Yerevan. The monastery is currently inactive. The fortress played a major role in protecting the north-western regions of Armenia (Gugark) and is among the most well preserved of all in modern Armenia. The main church at the compound is famous for its highly artistic frescoes, which cover the inside walls, the partitions, and the bearings of the building. The modern name of Akhtala was first recorded in a royal decree of 1438. The etymology of the name \\"Akhtala\\" is believed to be of Turkic origin, meaning \\"white glade\\". The original Armenian name of the settlement where the monastery is built is Pghindzahank, which means \\"copper mine\\". - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - Spitak, is a town in the northern Lori Province of Armenia. It is north of the capital, Yerevan, and west of the provincial centre, Vanadzor. Spitak was entirely destroyed during the devastating 1988 earthquake, and it was subsequently rebuilt in a slightly different location.

In 1995, the government of independent Armenia reaffirmed the status of Akhtala as a town. According to the 2009 official estimate, Akhtala has around 2,400 inhabitants. However, the town used to have around 4,500 inhabitants during the 1970s. - Sanahin is a village in the northern province of Lori in Armenia, now considered part of the city of Alaverdi (the cable car that connects it with the Alaverdi centre is supposed to have the steepest climb in the whole former USSR). The village is notable for its Sanahin Monastery complex, founded in the 10th century and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the monastery in nearby Haghpat. - Alaverdi, is a town in the Lori Province at the northeastern part of Armenia, near the border with Georgia. It is located at the only direct rail link between Armenia and Georgia. Situated at the bottom of the Debed river gorge, Alaverdi is an important commercial and industrial centre in northern Armenia. - The Armenian Highlands (also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highlands to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highlands. To the southwest of the Armenian Highlands is Upper Mesopotamia. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.

Article: Many famous painters worked in Antwerp during the city's period of greatest power but Peter Paul Rubens is undoubtedly the most famous one of them. Known as Rubens House, the palace-like residence and studio where Rubens worked and lived from 1616 until his death in 1640 is now one of Antwerp's most visited museums. Almost all of the works Rubens and his students created in the Rubens House have been dispersed over major museums across the whole world, but there is still an impressive collection well worth the visit. Besides paintings form the master himself you will find other works of art and furniture of the 17th century as well as paintings from his students, including works by Jacob Jordaens and Anthony Van Dyck. The Rubens House was not only a studio but also a meeting place for the rich and famous. His clients included wealthy merchants, diplomats, and there were also many noblemen who often visited his studio to see how work progressed. The Rubens House even had a special viewing area which allowed visitors to see the artists at work. Ruben bought the house at the beginning of the 17th century after his eight-year-long stay in Italy. Influenced by Italian architecture, he rebuilt the building into an Italian-styled palace with a beautiful garden and moved in the house in1616. After his death the building was sold. New owners modified the building greatly and by 1937, when the building was purchased by the city of Antwerp, it hardly resembled the original structure. The impressive entrance hall, which connected the studio and the residence, is one of the few parts that survived. Other parts have been carefully restored and reconstructed after original plans and paintings of the house. Question: What can be inferred from the text? Answer: OPTIONS: (I). Thanks to its great painters, Antwerp became a rich city.. (II). Ruben possibly showed strong interest in Italian buildings.. (III). Antwerp must be a historical city in Italy.. (IV). The Rubens House was completely rebuilt before 1937.. The answer is:","completion":"(II).

Answer the following question: Information: - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry. - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\" - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false. - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C , and a morphism : C C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n s + 2 g. - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms. - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is . - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\" Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2. - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood. - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges. - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research. - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra. - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them. - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

We have this equation: -21*l - 107*l = 2958 + 6642 First, let's combine the \\"l\\"s: -21*l and -107*l together would be like taking away 21 apples and then taking away 107 more apples. That would give us -128 apples, so we have: -128*l = 2958 + 6642 Now, let's add 2958 and 6642: 2958 is like having 2958 candies, and 6642 is like having 6642 candies. If we put them all together, we will have 9600 candies. So, our equation becomes: -128*l = 9600 The last step is to find \\"l\\": Since we have -128 \\"l\\"s, it means we're taking away 128 lollipops 128 times. To find out how many lollipops there are, we need to do the opposite of taking away (that's called \\"dividing\\"). So, we will divide 9600 candies by -128: l = 9600 / -128 Calculate that, and we get: l = -75 So the number \\"l\\" we were looking for is -75, like having 75 balloons, but they're going in the opposite direction (like moving down instead of up)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They thought it would be a nice idea to give these trains names based on 25 famous people from history. One of the names they picked was Anne Frank, a young girl who wrote a diary while hiding from bad people during a very difficult time called World War II. But some people did not think it was a good idea to use Anne Frank's name on a train. The reason for this is that during that difficult time, trains were used to take Anne and many others like her to very scary places, where they were hurt. In fact, Anne sadly died in one of those places. These people believe that putting her name on a train would bring back painful memories for the ones who lived through those difficult times and their families.

You are given a new situation: Two regions of the same country had very different climates because of the different landscapes. East region had an alpine landscape, was situated in the mountains. North region was flat and located at sea level. and a hint : Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

Detailed Instructions: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Context: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Question: Why did Meade lose his civil rights? Options: A. politicians stripped him of his civil rights. B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier. C. not enough information D. he became a convicted felon. Answer:","completion":"B. he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Two friends had unprotected sex with their respective dates on the same night. Everything went fine for both of them. They later found out the bad news. Mike had been infected with HIV. Luckily enough Pete was healthy, he didn't get any diseases. Which friend had a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood? Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . The answer is:","completion":"Mike had the virus that is transmitted by contact with infected blood. The virus in question here is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which ultimately causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and exposure to infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. In Mike's case, he contracted HIV through unprotected sexual contact with his date. Pete, on the other hand, was fortunate not to contract any diseases during his unprotected sexual encounter. Although he was also at risk, given the nature of the activity, he did not end up getting infected in this instance. HIV is a global issue that has affected millions of people around the world. As of 2008, it is estimated that 38.6 million individuals are living with HIV, and since its initial recognition in 1981, AIDS has led to the deaths of over 25 million people. The pandemic first originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and today it remains a significant public health concern. Prevention efforts, including practicing safe sex and regular testing, are crucial in reducing the spread of the virus.

When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them. Question: what I responded to mrs D Options: A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill B. I owe my early entry into the world to South Hill C. I owe my early entry into the world to Pontiac Hill D. not enough information === The correct answer is","completion":"A. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. In response to Ms. D's teasing about the questionable timeline of my birth, I explain that I have it on good authority that my early arrival into the world is due to Tabusintac Hill. This hill, located in New Brunswick, has a notorious reputation for its steep incline and sharp curve at the bottom, creating a challenging driving experience. In December of 1956, my parents were driving to the Miramichi in a borrowed Pontiac, with my mother being pregnant with me. As my father rounded the corner at the top of Tabusintac Hill, the road appeared to be clear of snow and ice; however, a moose suddenly stepped out onto the road just ahead of their car. The combination of the difficult terrain of Tabusintac Hill and the unexpected appearance of the moose contributed to the early arrival of myself, thus providing an explanation other than premarital relations. By stating that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill, I am emphasizing the role this challenging terrain played in the circumstances surrounding my birth. This response serves to counter Ms. D's playful insinuations and defend my dignity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this sentence, the speaker is commenting on the challenges they face regarding cultural barriers. A cultural barrier can be any obstacle that individuals or groups from different cultural backgrounds encounter while communicating or interacting with one another. These barriers arise due to differences in language, traditions, customs, beliefs, and attitudes. Overcoming cultural barriers is an essential skill in a globalized world where people and businesses need to collaborate and communicate with those from different cultures. To do so, one must understand and respect other cultures, their values, and their customs. This might involve learning the language or understanding non-verbal cues specific to those cultures, as well as having an open mind and empathy for other cultural perspectives. Working harder, as mentioned in the sentence, implies that one must put extra effort into navigating such barriers effectively by educating oneself on the cultural differences and developing strategies to communicate respectfully and effectively with people of diverse backgrounds. Through increased cultural awareness, one can foster more inclusive relationships and create a more unified global community. In summary, encountering cultural barriers can be challenging, but by working harder to understand and respect cultural differences, one can work towards promoting effective communication and cooperation among people from various backgrounds.

When we look at unemployment, the minister is boasting of fantastic surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund, which he is putting toward reduction of the deficit, when we look at the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus, the restrictions to the new employment insurance program, we see that this is no joke. Can we infer the following? The restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke. This statement suggests that the minister is taking credit for the impressive surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund. In turn, this surplus is being utilized to reduce the deficit, displaying the effectiveness of implemented restrictions. The reference to \\"no joke\\" emphasizes the seriousness of these actions and their significant impact on the fund surplus, further emphasizing the significance of the restrictions. To provide a more comprehensive explanation, the unemployment insurance fund is a government program that provides temporary financial assistance to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs due to no fault of their own and meet certain eligibility criteria. The fund collects premiums from both employers and employees to create a pool of resources to be distributed to eligible workers. When there is an increase in contributions or a decrease in benefits paid out, a surplus occurs. It is implied that the surplus is attributed to the restrictions on the new employment insurance program. These restrictions might include tightened eligibility criteria, reduced benefit amounts, or limited duration of benefits. Such restrictions aim to ensure that only deserving individuals receive the benefits and prevent misuse of the funds. Moreover, the surplus creates an opportunity for the minister to allocate the excess funds toward reducing the deficit, which usually refers to the difference between government revenue and its expenditure. This reduction in the deficit can be regarded as a positive outcome since it might translate to a lower debt burden for the government and can pave the way for future investments in social programs and public infrastructure. However, it is important to consider the potential implications of these restrictions on individuals seeking unemployment benefits. While the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund indicates fiscal responsibility, it could also mean that genuine cases of unemployment may not receive the assistance they need. This could be due to tightened eligibility criteria, which may exclude some workers from receiving benefits or discourage them from applying. Individuals who are already financially distressed might be further burdened due to the limitations of the insurance program. This could ultimately impact their ability to find new employment and reintegrate into the workforce. In conclusion, while we can infer that the restrictions which have helped accumulate the unemployment insurance fund surplus are no joke, it is also crucial to examine the potential consequences or drawbacks associated with these measures. Carefully analyzing the ramifications of the restrictions on all stakeholders, including both the government and the unemployed population, will help in achieving a balanced and sustainable approach to managing the unemployment insurance fund and addressing unemployment issues."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What kind of feelings did Steve have for Miss Tennessee? Options: A. Very positive feelings. B. Ambivalent feelings. C. Very negative feelings. D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"A.

LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art. See pictures from Banksy's exhibition » \\"I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs\\" Banksy, who is thought to be from Bristol, said about the museum. He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security, as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows' imminent arrival. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures.

Unfortunately, the spell goes awry and becomes a family curse: any man that falls for an Owens woman will die. And that's exactly what happens to Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens' father, causing their mother to die of a broken heart. The young girls then live with their two aunts (Stockard Channing, Diane Wiest), who teach them the ways of being a witch and how to deal with the ridicule that comes with the family profession. But one night when they witness their aunts casting a love spell for a neighbor, Sally decides she will never fall in love and dreams up a man that will never exist...Until one day she goes to town with her aunts and she meets the man she falls for. The next thing you know, Sally is happily married to Michael (Mark Feuerstein) with two daughters of her very own.

This design allows the client to access the directory without requiring it to support the cumbersome Open Systems Interconnection protocol stack., In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law., The United States Census Bureau (USCB; officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title ) is a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and economy., The Southern United States, commonly referred to as the American South, Dixie, or simply the South, is a region of the United States of America. The South does not exactly match the geographic south, but is predominantly located in the southeastern corner; Arizona and New Mexico, which are geographically in the southern part of the country, are rarely considered part of the Southern United States, while West Virginia, which separated from Virginia in 1863, commonly is. Some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. While the states of Delaware and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia permitted slavery prior to the start of the Civil War, they remained with the Union. Since the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, they became more culturally, economically, and politically aligned with the industrial Northern states, and are often identified as part of the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeast by many residents, businesses, public institutions, and private organizations. However, the United States Census Bureau puts them in the South., Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor., Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City., Chicken Express is a regional chain of fast food restaurants concentrated in the Southern United States ., New Mexico is a state located in the southwestern region of the United States of America. It was admitted to the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. It is usually considered one of the Mountain States. New Mexico is fifth by area, the 36th-most populous, and the sixth-least densely populated of the 50 United States., A fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant characterized both by its fast food cuisine and by minimal table service. Food served in fast food restaurants typically caters to a \\"meat-sweet diet\\" and is offered from a limited menu; is cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot; is finished and packaged to order; and is usually available ready to take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation, which provisions standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \\"fast food\\" was recognized in a dictionary by MerriamWebster in 1951., Fast food is a type of mass-produced food that is prepared and served very quickly. It began with the first fish and chip shops in Britain in the 1860s. Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The food is typically less nutritionally valuable compared to other foods and dishes. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. Fast food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a drive-through.

A: Choose your answer from: *coral selection. *characteristic selection. *intelligent selection. *natural selection. The answer is:","completion":"**natural selection.** Genetic diversity serves as a crucial raw material for natural selection. Over many generations, the resulting genetic diversity within a population provides an essential reservoir of variation that can be acted upon by natural selection. Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution that is based on the principle that individuals with certain inherited traits or characteristics are more likely to survive and reproduce than those without those traits. Genetic diversity is important because it provides the raw material from which new advantageous traits can emerge through genetic variation. When these advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population, it gives rise to changes in the species over time, resulting in evolution. Within a diverse genetic population, there is a higher likelihood of individuals carrying traits that can be advantageous or beneficial under different environmental conditions, pressures, or challenges. When the environment changes or a new stressor is introduced, individuals with specific traits that allow them to better cope with these changes have a higher probability of survival and reproduction. Their offspring will inherit these traits at a higher frequency, leading to a gradual change in the population over generations. It is essential to maintain a high level of genetic diversity, even in stable environments, because it will grant a population greater resilience against unforeseen changes, such as the appearance of diseases or alterations in climate. High genetic diversity also facilitates adaptation to new environments, as it increases the chances of individuals possessing the necessary traits for survival and reproduction in those new conditions. In conclusion, the genetic diversity generated over many generations serves as vital raw material for natural selection, which drives the evolution of species. This diversity aids in the adaptation of populations to changing environments and ensures the long-term survival and resilience of a species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With a sigh, he realizes that the tire has finally met its mileage and will need to be replaced to avoid-dangerous blowouts in the future. Determined to not let these unexpected repairs ruin his day, he takes a moment to appreciate the beauty of the old lime-green bicycle, remembering all the exhilarating rides, challenging uphill climbs, and breezy descents they've shared together. Just like any faithful companion, it has been with him through thick and thin, and this tire replacement is just another chapter in their long-shared history. The man rummages through the group of boxes, searching for a replacement tire he'd bought a few months back, anticipating this very moment. After rummaging for a few minutes, he finally finds the brand-new tire tucked away in a dusty box filled with various bicycle maintenance tools. Dusting off the cobwebs and filth, he unfurls the tire and takes a moment to admire its pristine condition, excited that the bike will soon have a new lease on life. With practiced hands, he disassembles the bike's wheel, removing the damaged tire and worn-out inner tube. Carefully, he prepares the new tire and inner tube for installation, ensuring that they are free from any sharp objects that could damage them. He spends several minutes meticulously aligning the new tire on the wheel's rim and inflating the tube to the proper pressure. As he works, he recalls the advice his father had given him years ago when he was first learning about bicycle maintenance: \\"Take care of your bike, and it will take care of you.\\" He feels a strong connection not only to the bike but also to the shared wisdom passed down through generations. Once the new tire is securely in place, the man systematically reassembles the wheel and affixes it back onto the bike, ensuring that the brakes and gears are properly aligned. With the tire replacement process complete, he pumps a few more bursts of air just to get that perfect tire pressure he prefers for his rides. Finally, he takes a step back to admire his freshly rejuvenated bicycle, gleaming under the sun as the vibrant green paint seems to almost radiate with newfound energy. The man feels an intense wave of satisfaction and pride in caring for his trusty steed. Despite the seemingly mundane task, these moments of maintenance are some of the most cherished memories he's made in his love affair with cycling. As he finishes cleaning up the scattered tools and boxes, the man eagerly begins to mentally plan out his next adventure on his now fully-equipped bike, eager to hit the open road and explore new terrain like never before. And as he hops on his bicycle and rides off into the distance, he can't help but smile as he imagines all the thrilling experiences that lie ahead for him and his renewed companion, the lime-green bike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the Kangxi Dictionary published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct. The Kangxi Dictionary was published in 1716, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The Kangxi Dictionary is a comprehensive Chinese dictionary that remains an authoritative reference for the study of the Chinese language even today. The Kangxi Emperor, who reigned from 1661 to 1722, was a great patron of literature and learning. Apart from sponsoring the creation of the Kangxi Dictionary, he also commissioned other literary works, such as the Peiwen Yunfu, a rhyme dictionary that was published in 1711. The compilation of the Kangxi Dictionary was a significant undertaking and involved a large team of scholars led by Zhang Yushu and Chen Tingjing. The dictionary consists of 47,035 characters, with detailed explanations, examples of usage, and graphical variants. This vast compendium draws upon a wide range of earlier dictionaries, lexical works, and commentaries, making it an invaluable resource for understanding classical Chinese texts. One notable feature of the Kangxi Dictionary is its use of the 214 \\"radicals\\" or \\"Kangxi radicals\\" as the primary ordering principle. By arranging characters under their radicals, which are basic graphical components shared by a group of characters, the dictionary made it easier for users to locate specific characters and understand their meanings. This system of classification is still widely employed in many modern Chinese dictionaries. In summary, the Kangxi Dictionary was published in 1716 and stands as an enduring testament to the linguistic accomplishments of the Kangxi era. Along with the Peiwen Yunfu published in 1711, these works highlight the Kangxi Emperor's commitment to promoting literature and learning during his reign."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Coming off their bye week, the Lions were at home and wearing their alternate uniforms for a Week 7 duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In the first quarter, Detroit attacked first with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 34-yard field goal, along with RB Kevin Jones getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Buccaneers got on the board with QB Jeff Garcia completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Ike Hilliard. Afterwards, the Lions ended the half with Hanson kicking a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Detroit increased its lead with Hanson nailing a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Lions increased its lead with WR Calvin Johnson getting a 32-yard TD run. Afterwards, Tampa Bay worked on a comeback as Garcia completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Maurice Stovall. Later, the Buccaneers would recover their onside kick and eventually turn it into kicker Matt Bryant's 48-yard field goal. Fortunately, Detroit erased the Buccaneers' hopes of recovering another onside kick. With the win, the Lions improved to 4-2, and also surpassed their 2006 win total.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that building more wind turbines would affect the acidity of rain. In this case, the perturbation could have an indirect effect on the process. Wind turbines are a renewable energy source that generates electricity without releasing harmful emissions, as opposed to burning coal, which emits sulfur oxides that contribute to acid rain. By building more wind turbines, the reliance on coal as an energy source might be reduced, leading to less coal being burned. Consequently, this would lower the amount of sulfur oxides released into the atmosphere and reduce the formation of sulfuric acid, resulting in less acidic rain. In summary, the perturbation of building more wind turbines could lead to less acidic rain by indirectly reducing the sulfur oxide emissions from burning coal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fill out a Fee Waiver if you cannot afford to pay the filing fee. Fill out any required local forms. File your forms with the court and have them served on the other party.\\"","completion":"Title: Navigating the Process of Responding to Family Court Documents Introduction: Receiving court documents, particularly those involving child custody or other family matters, can be a daunting experience. However, understanding the process and your options when responding to such documents is essential to preserving your rights and ensuring the best outcome possible. This article will outline the steps involved in preparing and filing the appropriate forms to respond to family court documents, as well as the process of serving the other party with these forms. Step 1: Understand the Respondent's Options Before you can begin preparing your response, it's important to understand your options as the respondent in a family court case. You may be faced with various scenarios, such as custody disputes, spousal support requests, or property division matters. In each case, your response should be tailored to address the specific issue at hand. It's essential to consult an attorney for legal advice pertaining to your unique situation. Step 2: Fill Out a Response Once you have a clear understanding of your options and the issues at hand, you will need to fill out a response form. This form is designed to let the court know your perspective on the matter and to provide any information relevant to your case that might not be included in the petitioner's documents. Be sure to read the instructions carefully, and fill out the form completely and accurately to avoid any delays or misunderstandings. Step 3: Fill Out a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) if Applicable If you have minor children with the petitioner, it's crucial to complete a Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) form along with your response. The UCCJEA is a set of uniform rules governing child custody determinations across state lines to prevent conflicting custody orders. Filling out this form ensures the court is aware of any existing custody orders and provides information on the child's residence and any other relevant details. Step 4: Fill Out a Fee Waiver if Necessary Filing fees for family court cases can be expensive, but if you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may be eligible for a fee waiver. This involves completing a form that collects information about your income, expenses, and the size of your family in order to assess your financial eligibility. If approved, a fee waiver enables you to file your response without paying the standard filing fee. Step 5: Fill Out Any Required Local Forms In some jurisdictions, there may be additional local forms required for your specific case type. Be sure to check with your local court clerk or consult your attorney to ensure you have completed all necessary forms. Step 6: File Your Forms with the Court Once all the necessary forms are completed and signed, you will need to submit them to the appropriate court in your jurisdiction. It's a good idea to make multiple copies of your documents, as you may need to provide copies to the other party, your attorney, and for your own records. Step 7: Serve the Other Party After the court has received your forms, you must ensure the other party is notified of your response. This typically involves having a neutral third party, such as a process server or a county sheriff, physically deliver a copy of the documents to the petitioner. Legal service of process ensures that the other party is aware of your response and has the opportunity to respond if they choose to do so. Conclusion: While the process of responding to family court documents can be overwhelming, following these steps and seeking legal guidance when necessary can help ensure you protect your rights and achieve the best possible outcome for your case. Remember that proper organization, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of the process will significantly contribute to a successful resolution."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Do you like listening to music? Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? - A decibel is a unit that measures sound. - In fact, a decibel is also a kind of noise. - A person who hates sound belongs to decibels. - Machines that make loud noise are called decibels.

Step 2: Analyze the remaining options Now we are left with three possible options: \\"suitcase,\\" \\"closet,\\" and \\"drawer.\\" Step 3: Assess practicality and accessibility A \\"suitcase\\" is generally used for packing clothes and other items when traveling, so it is not an ideal everyday storage place for a t-shirt. While a t-shirt could be kept in a suitcase, it would likely be temporary and not the primary storage location. A \\"closet\\" is a common place for storing clothes, and it could be a valid place to keep a t-shirt. However, closets are often associated with hanging clothes on hangers, and t-shirts are usually folded, which makes the \\"drawer\\" option more suitable for storing folded items like t-shirts.

Write some highlights for the following article: A 5-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long. Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American and a member of the Navajo Nation, was dismissed from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas for violating school policy that states boys can't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt, or wear ponytails. Many Native Americans believe that hair is scared, and cutting it is a manifestation of loss. Scroll down for video. Kicked out: 5-year-old Malachi Wilson was sent home from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas on his first day of school because of his long hair, and told he needed to cut it to return. Heartbreaking: 'How do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in?' asked April Wilson, Malachi's mother. 'After we had enrolled him he was excited. He was ready to go. Everyday it was the question, \\"Mom, [am I] going to school?\\"' his mother, April Wilson, told KOSA. No sooner had he arrived however, than Malachi was sent home, with an order from the school's principal, Sherrie Warren, to cut his hair if he wanted to return. Adding insult to injury, when his mother protested his dismissal, noting her son's Native American religious beliefs, Miss Wilson demanded she show proof of his heritage. Once she had provided formal proof Malachi was indeed Native American, he was allowed to return to school, but the young boy still seems hurt. 'It was a sad day,' he said of being sent home. 'It’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in? Because of his religion, because of what’s part of him,' his mother added. 'Our hair is sacred to us.' Proof: Malachi's mother April was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son's Navajo heritage, and bring it to the school. School policy: The Seminole Independent School District does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars, or wear ponytails. She said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district. School district officials say they followed procedure, and pointed out the rule in their handbook that says, 'certain recognized religious or spiritual beliefs may qualify for an exception from provisions of the dress code.' Interestingly enough, the school's mascot is a Seminole, with long hair. Similar case: Adriel Arocha, a member of the Lipan Apache, tribe was was also sent home from school for having long hair in 2008. His family took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and won. Malachi's story is very similar to that of another Texas kindergartner, Adriel Arocha, who is also Native American and was also sent home for having hair that was deemed too long by officials in his school district back in 2008. Adriel, a member of the Lipan Apache tribe, and his family were told by the Needville Independent School District that he must either cut or conceal his hair. The family eventually took their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the district refused to give Adriel an exemption for religious beliefs, and in 2010 a judge ruled in the family's favor.","completion":"A 5-year-old boy named Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American, was sent home on his first day of kindergarten because his hair was too long.

Answer:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me purchasing the product. The review expresses a few concerns which can be significant deciding factors. Let's examine these concerns one by one: 1. **Uncertainty about the product quality**: The phrase \\"you may get a good or bad battery\\" suggests an inconsistency in the product quality. This could indicate inconsistent manufacturing or quality control processes. As a potential buyer, this introduces a significant risk, especially for a product such as a battery, where safety and reliability are of paramount importance. 2. **The product didn't work**: The reviewer's most significant point is that the battery did not work after being charged, despite being purchased new. This represents a direct failure of the product to perform its primary function and is a major red flag. 3. **The urgency of the situation**: The reviewer bought this battery as an extra for use during a vacation. This indicates that the buyer had a time-sensitive need for the product, increasing the importance of its failure to function. As a potential buyer, this situation would make me question the product's reliability, particularly in moments when I might need it most. 4. **Buyer Beware!**: This last remark can be seen as a warning to potential buyers about the product. It should be taken seriously as it signifies the buyer's regret for purchasing the product and their decision to advise others against it. In conclusion, while this is only one review, it raises several substantial concerns about the product. It indicates that there may be potential quality control issues, reliability problems, and a chance for the product to fail when most needed. Therefore, it would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. Naturally, it is also important to consider other available reviews and product information before making a final decision."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Says Small Tax Increase Now May Prevent Large Hike Later Political observers are growing slightly more optimistic about the prospects of a super-committee breakthrough – fueled by an openness by leading Republicans to at least entertain the prospect of new revenues as part of a broad deficit deal. Such a deal could prove problematic to Republicans, the vast majority of whom have signed the Americans for Tax Reform pledge vowing not to raise taxes. But on ABC’s “Top Line” today, a leading Republican lawmaker who has signed the pledge said he and other signers need to consider any deal not just in terms of current taxes, but also for what it could mean for taxes down the road. “Each member of Congress has to look at this in terms of their relationship with their constituents, and any plan that’s put on the table has to be given careful consideration, not just in terms of what it does right now but what it will do in the long term,” said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. “We are facing major increases in taxes in January of 2013 [with the expiration of a series of tax cuts], just a little over a year from now, and this is an opportunity to alter that path in a significant way. So you can look at it as a tax increase, but you can also view it as an agreement that avoids major tax increases in the future and instead defines a different pathway that involves lower taxes than you’d have in 2013.” Asked whether that means he could support something that violates Grover Norquist’s famous pledge, Goodlatte added: “Well, I think all members of Congress ought to give all of these a careful look, and then they have to decide for themselves — does that really mean tax increases or does it mean a different pathway that avoids tax increases in the future?” There is no deal in place from the super-committee, at least not yet. In any event, Goodlatte’s push this week is for a Balanced Budget Amendment – the passage of which, while it’s a longshot in the House and the Senate – would lessen the impact of budget cuts that might otherwise be enacted. Goodlatte’s amendment will come up for a vote in the House this week – the first time since a similar measure passed the House in 1995 that it’s even come up for a final vote. “This is an opportunity for real bipartisanship and to really connect directly with your constituents, and all the other forces that are in play here — including the wishes of members whipping and their leadership — can be ignored, because constituents understand this issue better than any other,” he said. “They have to live with it themselves. Their state legislatures have a balanced-budget requirement, and that’s why we think a lot of Democrats will join us on this vote.” And Goodlatte talked up the prospect of his home-state governor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, joining a national ticket next year as a vice-presidential candidate. “Bob McDonnell would be a great participant in a Republican ticket going into the elections in 2012,” Goodlatte said. “I also think that we have a great opportunity to win back Virginia. Last time was the first time in 40 years that Virginia did not go for the Republican candidate. I think the views of the electorate in Virginia about the president and his performance are very different than the expectations they had when he carried the state. And so with other candidates on the ballot we are likely to carry Virginia as well, but Bob McDonnell would definitely seal the deal.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte says a small tax increase now may prevent a larger tax hike in the future, and encourages members of Congress to carefully consider this possibility.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? naturally dramatic","completion":"Based on the given review with the phrase \\"naturally dramatic,\\" it is not clear whether the opinion of the movie is positive or negative without additional context. The review is too short and lacks information to make a clear determination. However, let's provide an analysis of the phrase itself and how it could potentially be interpreted: 1. Positive interpretation: If the phrase 'naturally dramatic' is interpreted as a compliment to the movie, it could mean that the reviewer appreciates the organic and genuine drama presented in the movie without resorting to artificial or forced storytelling. In this case, the reviewer might be praising the movie's ability to create strong emotional responses and conflicts without being overly manipulative or unnatural with the plot or the character development. This interpretation signifies the reviewer's positive experience with the movie and their recommendation for others to watch and enjoy the the film's dramatic attributes. 2. Negative interpretation: Alternatively, the reviewer might use 'naturally dramatic' as a critique of the movie. This interpretation could suggest that the reviewer found the movie to be overly dramatic, with soap opera-like tropes or clichéd, emotionally heavy-handed scenes. In this context, the reviewer may find that the drama within the plot is either excessive or distracting from the movie's core themes and storytelling.

Noh, which means 'skill' or 'talent' in Japanese, integrates elements of music, dance, and drama, and is known for its artistic depth and refinement. Kan'ami was a renowned actor and playwright in his time. He started as a sarugaku performer, which was a form of popular drama during the Muromachi period, characterized by acrobatics, dance, and music. Over time, Kan'ami integrated more serious and classical elements into his performances, drawing inspiration from religious themes, aristocratic culture, and the influence of Chinese literature. He managed to introduce innovative features and elevated the art form to new aesthetic heights. Zeami Motokiyo, Kan'ami's son and pupil, also played a significant role in the evolution of Noh. He was not only a talented playwright and noh actor but also a theoretician who wrote numerous treatises on the art of noh, such as \\"Fūshi kaden\\" (The Transmission of the Flower of Acting Style) and \\"Kakyo\\" (The Mirror Held to the Flower). These treatises offered insights into the philosophy, aesthetics, and principles underlying noh, as well as practical advice and guidance for actors and playwrights. Under Zeami's influence, Noh absorbed aspects of Zen Buddhism and the refined court culture, which transformed it from an entertainment form to a profound artistic expression. Zeami's contributions greatly impacted various aspects of Noh, including performance style, symbolism, the use of masks, and the thematic depth of the plays. Throughout history, noh developed and underwent further refinements under the patronage of powerful figures, such as shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, it was Kan'ami and Zeami who are widely recognized as the founders and pioneers of Noh, leaving a lasting legacy on this deeply rooted Japanese theatrical tradition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her family often made travel plans with Castro that they then had to cancel because of her father's obsession with his own four walls. Gregg said that she never saw signs of the 6-year-old at her father's house and that she never saw her with him. But about two months ago, he showed her a picture in his cell phone. Gregg asked who it was. Her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend's child by somebody else. \\"I figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there, you know, and I would find out eventually,\\" Gregg said.

But he beat their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors. He was very jealous, Gregg said. \\"When Mom and Dad were fighting, it's like I just wanted to melt into the ground,\\" she said. \\"I've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man,\\" Gregg remembered. Then after a bludgeoning, her mother had enough, and the family split up. The other children left with her mother, but Gregg stuck by Castro, believing the excuses he made for the violence. She finished growing up under his roof, she said. How this case differed from the 'House of Horrors' A daughter divorced.

Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put? Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests. They had one of the largest concentration of tropical species. In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact. Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that the indigenous animals of Costa Rica would most likely survive and stay put. The main factors contributing to this conclusion are the differences in land use and conservation efforts between Nicaragua and Costa Rica. In the 1980s, Nicaragua cleared a significant portion of its pristine forests and replaced them with vast tracts of sugarcane fields. In contrast, Costa Rica maintained its pristine forests intact, preserving the natural habitat for its indigenous animals. The paragraph also highlights the importance of biodiversity in helping ecosystems adapt to disasters and providing a varied food supply for animals. When land is used for monoculture agriculture (e.g., sugarcane in Nicaragua), its biodiversity declines, making the ecosystem less adaptable and leading to a decrease in available food sources for animals. As a result, animal populations may die out or, more likely, relocate to more favorable habitats. In the case of the Tibetan Plateau, the consequences of degraded land and loss of biodiversity have been significant. This includes the endangerment of 15-20% of its species, poor soil quality, and severe erosion, in addition to economic losses. Considering these factors, it is evident that Costa Rica's preservation of its pristine forests makes it more likely that the country's indigenous animals would survive and stay put. The intact forests provide a stable and diverse habitat for the animals, with all the necessary resources and adaptability to withstand potential disasters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brothers John (eldest) and Bobby had brief careers in the minor leagues. Although his three older brothers were born in Brooklyn, George was born in the northern panhandle of West Virginia. Jack and Ethel Brett then moved the family to the Midwest and three years later to El Segundo, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, just south of Los Angeles International Airport. Following his playing career, Brett became a vice president of the Royals and has worked as a part-time coach, as a special instructor in spring training, as an interim batting coach, and as a minor league instructor dispatched to help prospects develop. He also runs a baseball equipment and foam-hand company, Brett Bros., with Bobby and, until his death, Ken Brett. He has also lent his name to a restaurant that failed on the Country Club Plaza. In 1992, Brett married the former Leslie Davenport, and they reside in the Kansas City suburb of Mission Hills, Kansas. The couple has three children: Jackson (named after George's father), Dylan (named after Bob Dylan), and Robin (named after fellow Hall of Famer Robin Yount of the Milwaukee Brewers). Brett has continued to raise money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Brett started to raise money for the Keith Worthington Chapter during his playing career in the mid-1980s. He and his dog Charlie appeared in a PETA ad campaign, encouraging people not to leave their canine companions in the car during hot weather.

An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive slime mold-like substance (the Blob) that attaches itself to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being devoured by the growing Blob. While she tries to free him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, and the Blob oozes out of the hospital as Paul attempts to scream in pain while dissolving inside the Blob one last time. After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian is incredibly skeptical of Meg's story. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman, George, is pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob suddenly retreats after entering the freezer.

Solve 3636*l = 49006 + 41571 + 36683 for l.","completion":"To find the value of 'l', you need to first simplify the equation on the right-hand side, then isolate 'l' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'l', which is 3636 in this case. Let's follow these steps: 1. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation: The equation is: 3636*l = 49006 + 41571 + 36683 Add these numbers together: 49006 + 41571 + 36683 = 127260 So the equation now becomes: 3636*l = 127260 2. Next, you isolate 'l' in the equation: You do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3636. The equation is: l = 127260 / 3636 Use a calculator to divide 127260 by 3636, the answer is approximately 34.995881. So, l is approximately 34.995881. Remember this is rounded to nine decimal places, your needs might require a different level of rounding. Also note, if you were asked to solve the equation for an integer value of 'l', you would need to round this result to the nearest whole number, in this case, l would then be approximately 35."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: El Cid: The Legend Movie plot: The Arab tyrant Ben Yusuf invades the muslim taifa of Zaragoza, as the beginning of his campaign to conquer the entire Iberian peninsula. As a result, prince Al-Mu'tamin flees to Castile to warn king Ferdinand of Yusufs invasion. In Castile, Rodrigo de Vivar is living a life of privilege as the son of a nobleman. He is best friends with prince Sancho and is secretly in a romantic relationship with Jimena, the daughter of count Gormaz. Unfortunately, Gormaz disapproves, and suggests that Jimena should marry the arrogant and self-centered count OrdoÃ±ez. As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, OrdoÃ±es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene.

At all airports the use of a traffic pattern (often called a traffic circuit outside the U.S.) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern aviation for performing this pattern, provided there is no queue. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath, without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment, things are very differently though. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is it like for aircraft landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath?","completion":"At small airfields without Instrument Landing System (ILS) equipment, aircraft typically rely on visual flight rules (VFR) to land safely and quickly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it's like for aircraft landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath: 1. Approach: As the aircraft approaches the small airfield, the pilot will visually identify the runway and its surroundings. They will also monitor the aircraft's altitude, airspeed, and positioning relative to the airfield. 2. Descent: Once the aircraft is aligned with the runway and is within the appropriate distance from the airfield, the pilot will initiate a descent along the glidepath. The glidepath is a predetermined angle, usually around 3 degrees, that guides the aircraft towards the runway. 3. Checklist completion: During the descent, the pilot will complete necessary checklists to ensure the aircraft is configured correctly for landing. This may include setting the flaps, adjusting the aircraft's trim, and verifying the landing gear is down and locked. 4. Airspeed management: The pilot will manage the aircraft's speed during the approach to ensure a safe and effective landing. They may need to adjust the power setting and make other minor corrections to maintain the desired airspeed throughout the descent. 5. Visual cues: The pilot will continuously monitor visual cues such as the runway's aiming point markers, threshold markings, and the PAPI or VASI visual glidepath indicators (if available) to ensure the aircraft remains on the correct glidepath during the final descent. 6. Roundout and touchdown: As the aircraft reaches the runway, the pilot will round out the descent by gradually raising the aircraft's nose to reduce the descent rate and control the touchdown point. Once the appropriate speed and attitude are achieved, the aircraft will touch down on the runway. In summary, landing at small airfields as fast as possible while following the glidepath involves a combination of visual navigation, precise aircraft control, and adherence to the predetermined glidepath. The lack of ILS equipment demands heightened situational awareness and focus from the pilot when performing this maneuver."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence 1: well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children Sentence 2: The answer is to not concentrate on the children. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. An entailment is when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In your case, the two sentences present contrasting statements about the focus on children. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the context and meaning: Sentence 1: \\"Well, well, what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on, uh, you know, the children.\\" This sentence suggests that the correct or preferred course of action is to focus on the children. The hesitations (uh, you know) in the sentence indicate that the speaker may be unsure or looking for the right word, but ultimately, the sentence clearly presents a directive to concentrate on the children. Sentence 2: \\"The answer is to not concentrate on the children.\\" This sentence contradicts the first sentence by proposing that the correct action is to not focus on the children. This is a clear, direct statement with no hesitations, intending to communicate an opposing viewpoint to the first sentence. Since the first sentence suggests concentrating on the children, and the second sentence suggests not concentrating on them, the two sentences do not entail one another. Rather, they express different opinions on the subject matter. In fact, the second sentence seems to negate, or contradict, the claim made in the first sentence, making the relationship between the two sentences adversative rather than entailment-based."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Answer the question based on the following text. Question: John was watching the car being built. He observed that the larger the body size, the surface area to volume ration Increased or Decreased? Text: Size restriction: The final body size is limited because as the body size increases, the surface area to volume ratio decreases. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, as the body size increases, the surface area to volume ratio decreases. Therefore, when John was watching the car being built and observed that the larger the body size, the surface area to volume ratio actually decreased. To further explain the concept, let's consider the mathematical relationship between surface area and volume. Surface area refers to the total area covered by the outer surface of an object, whereas volume refers to the amount of space occupied by an object. For a simplified car model, let us assume it has a rectangular cuboidal shape. The formulae for the surface area (SA) and volume (V) of a rectangular cuboid are as follows: SA = 2(height*width) + 2(height*length) + 2(width*length) V = height * width * length Now consider the surface area to volume (SA/V) ratio, which is a dimensionless quantity. A higher SA/V ratio means that the surface area is larger relative to the volume, while a lower SA/V ratio means that the volume is comparatively larger than the surface area. As the body size increases, the height, width, and length of the car will all increase, causing a significant increase in volume. Although the surface area may also increase with the increasing dimensions, the increase in volume is comparatively more rapid than the increase in surface area. This results in the SA/V ratio decreasing as the body size increases. Thus, for the car being built observed by John, the surface area to volume ratio decreased as the body size increased, which is consistent with the statement in the text. This also highlights the size restriction mentioned in the text, suggesting that an optimal balance between surface area and volume is important for designing vehicles, as several practical factors depend on it, such as heat exchange, structural support, material availability, and energy efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When did Operation Desert Storm occur? Passage 1:Page was born on 14 January 1900 in Lambeth, London. He went to school at Dulwich College, where he was captain of shooting, before attending Jesus College, Oxford, where he was captain of the boat club. He was a master at St Paul's School from 1926 to 1963, where he was a rowing coach. He maintained links with Oxford, successfully coaching Oriel College from their position in 21st place in 1928 to become Head of the River between 1933 and 1936. He also coached Oxford and Cambridge Boat Clubs at various times. He was captain of Thames Rowing Club in 1934 and in 1947–48. In 1952, he became honorary secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association (secretary from 1963 onwards), retiring in 1972. He was elected as Master of the Broderers' Company in 1960, a steward of the Henley Royal Regatta in 1962, and Master of the Fletchers' Company in 1971.

He was promoted to the first team by manager Mauricio Pochettino, making his La Liga debut on 30 January 2010 in a 1–0 home win against Athletic Bilbao (which, in his own words, came as a \\"surprise\\") and ending his first professional season with 11 league games, starting and playing all the minutes in every match as the Pericos finished in mid-table; previously, he appeared with the main squad in the 2008 final of the Copa Catalunya, lost 1–2 to UE Sant Andreu, and signed a five-year contract with the club shortly after. Passage 3:In the 1970s and early 1980s the battalion furnished Combat Engineer Support to the Battalion Landing Teams (BLT) in the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, 29 Palms, Norway, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. From August 1982 to February 1984 Marines from 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion were part of the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut, Lebanon. Late in October 1983, Combat Engineers landed and occupied the island of Grenada with the 22nd Marine Amphibious Unit. The battalion continued to provide Combat Engineer Platoons to the BLT's of the 22nd and 26th Marine Expeditionary Units and support elements of the division throughout the world. During April 1990, elements of the Battalion supported division units attached to Marine Forces Panama and participated in Operation Just Cause. In August 1990, Company D, while deployed aboard the off the coast of West Africa participated in Operation Sharp Edge assisting in the evacuation of civilians from Liberia. During Operation Desert Storm the Battalion deployed in support of the 4th MEB and the 2nd Marine Division leading the division through the myriad of obstacle belts into Kuwait.

The baby loved stars and circles. He loved the OPTIONS: i. stars the best because it was pointless. ii. circles the best because it was pointless.","completion":"The baby loved stars and circles. He loved the circles the best because it was pointless. One day, the baby gazed outside the window, his bright blue eyes following the crescent moon high up in the sky. His tiny hands reached out for it, giggling and cooing in joy as he tried to grab the luminous, night-time orb. This fascination with celestial bodies led his parents to adorn the nursery with countless images and shapes of stars and circles. Step 1: Set the scene. The nursery was a cozy, warm space filled with soft pastel colors and calming melodies from the mobile gently serenading the baby to sleep. The walls were decorated with a hand-painted mural of the sky, complete with fluffy clouds, twinkling stars, and perfect, round circles. Step 2: Introduce characters. His parents, Sarah and James, were overjoyed with their little boy's unique interests and did everything they could to nurture his wonderment. They would often lie down beside him on the floor, looking up at the mural, pointing at the various shapes while teaching him the difference between the stars and circles. Step 3: Create action and conflict. As the days passed, they noticed that their baby was more drawn to the circles as compared to the stars. Whenever he saw circles, be it the moon, the wheels on his toy car, or even his mother's button earrings, he would gurgle with enthusiasm, reaching out to touch them with his tiny fingers. The stars, while still fascinating, didn't give him the same thrill. Step 4: Introduce a dilemma. Sarah and James began to worry about their son's fixation with circles and pondered over the reasons. Was there an underlying meaning to the baby's preference? Was he trying to express something through this inclination? Confronted with these questions, they decided to consult a child psychologist to better understand their child's behavior. Step 5: Explore the resolution. During the consultation with the child psychologist, they discovered that it was completely normal for babies to be fascinated with shapes, and in this case, circles. In fact, the psychologist explained that the baby found the circle's attribute of being pointless to be what made them special. With no sharp edges or corners, circles symbolized simplicity, comfort, and unity. Step 6: Reflect on the outcome. Sarah and James felt relieved that their son's affection for circles wasn't a cause for concern, but rather, a testimony to his unique perspective. They continued to support his interests, filling his world with an array of shapes, fostering his love for them. And thus, the baby continued to cherish the circles in his life, marveling at the seemingly ordinary, yet profound attributes of a shape that was truly pointless, yet endlessly special."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In principle, any galvanic cell could be used as a battery. An ideal battery would never run down, produce an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal characteristics and practical limitations. For example, the mass of a car battery is about 18 kg or about 1% of the mass of an average car or light-duty truck. This type of battery would supply nearly unlimited energy if used in a smartphone, but would be rejected for this application because of its mass. Thus, no single battery is “best” and batteries are selected for a particular application, keeping things like the mass of the battery, its cost, reliability, and current capacity in mind. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. A few batteries of each type are described next.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer places for owls to perch could have both direct and indirect effects on the different stages of the bird reproduction and development process. 1. Mating: If there are fewer places for owls to perch, it may be harder for them to find a suitable place for courtship displays and mating rituals. They may need to expend more energy searching for an appropriate location, which could lead to lower mating success. 2. Nesting: Owls require secure places to build a nest and lay eggs. If the availability of good nesting sites is reduced, it can potentially limit the number of eggs that can be successfully laid and incubated. This could contribute to a decrease in the population of owls. 3. Incubation: If the remaining perching sites are not well-suited for incubating eggs, it may negatively impact the incubation process. A lower incubation success rate can lead to fewer bird hatchlings. 4. Rearing offspring: Parent birds require safe locations to rear, protect, and feed their growing offspring. Decreased availability of perching locations might make it harder for parents to meet these needs, which could cause a higher mortality rate among juveniles. 5. Learning to fly: Young birds need to learn to fly, often practicing from their perching location. If there are fewer suitable perching sites, it might take longer for fledglings to develop the necessary skills to fly successfully. This would increase their vulnerability to predators and potentially lead to a higher mortality rate. 6. Breeding: If fewer birds are able to leave the nest successfully and reach maturity due to the factors mentioned above, it can lead to a smaller breeding population in the future, potentially resulting in even fewer offspring overall. In summary, the perturbation of fewer places for owls to perch could have negative effects on various stages of the bird reproduction and development process, from mating and nesting to learning to fly and breeding. These effects can lead to a decrease in the overall bird population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Question: How does the mom feel about the world? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The mother feels a mix of emotions about the world. On one hand, she has experienced a great deal of pain and suffering due to the traumatic events she faced in her teenage years. As a result, she cannot help but worry for her children's safety, particularly her daughters. She likely views the world with a sense of caution and concern, given her own experiences and how young she was when she was abused. On the other hand, the mother has also experienced support, healing, and growth through counseling, medication, and the love from her family. This demonstrates that there are people and resources in the world that can help survivors of trauma heal and move forward. Through her memoir and public speaking, she is working to raise awareness and help others, showing that she also believes in the power of change and the ability to make the world a better and safer place. In her efforts to educate her children about body safety and activism, she's striving to balance awareness and protection with empowering them to be strong, resilient individuals who don't need to fear the world. She hopes that her own strength and dedication to helping others, as well as the important values she instills in her children, will contribute to a more just and compassionate world. In summary, the mother feels a complex range of emotions about the world - from worry and fear arising from her traumatic past, to hope and determination as she works to create change and support others. It is a difficult balancing act, but she focuses on both protecting her children and teaching them to be strong and resilient, working towards a safer and more understanding world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand . \\"Excuse me, son?\\" he said. \\"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\\" For the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately. In the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities. Edward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write.

News article: To the extent that we think about them at all, people tend to regard dung beetles as entertainment, rolling, tumbling, even somersaulting over massive balls of elephant poop. But the 5,000 or so species at work on every continent except Antarctica are as important as pollinators. Animals unload an estimated 100 billion tons of dung on Earth every day. Just one cow can drop 20 cowpats daily and quickly smother a landscape in manure. By bringing poop back to their underground nests and feeding it to their young, dung beetles not only clear pastureland and reopen it for grazing, but also help to cycle nutrients through the land, aerate soil, disperse seeds, and reduce the output of methane by 40 percent. Dung beetles \\"can potentially do in 48 hours what would take a couple years\\" for nature to accomplish without them, a Missouri livestock researcher recently enthused. Studies have valued the services provided by dung beetles to the cattle industry in the United States and the United Kingdom alone at about 910 million a year. But like pollinators, dung beetles are now in trouble. That's partly from habitat loss, as forests and grasslands give way to agriculture. Poachers who kill 33,000 elephants and 1,200-plus rhinos every year also hurt dung beetles, because there's less poop for them to eat. A bigger threat to their survival, though, may come from one of our most successful humanitarian efforts. Ivermectin, an antifilarial drug, is the essential tool in eradicating river blindness from the developing world. It's also the standard treatment for infection by a microfilarial worm that can cause elephantiasis, a grotesque swelling of the lower limbs. Over 30 years, ivermectin, distributed for free for these purposes by Merck & Co., has lifted hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people up from disability and despair. This past fall, the developers of ivermectin earned a share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It would be hard to imagine a discovery more worthy of the honor. Ivermectin is also one of the most widely used veterinary drugs and, for many years, it made Merck more than 1 billion a year. Livestock producers all over the world administer it to control liver flukes, eye worms, lungworms, roundworms, mites, horn flies, ticks. In case all this seems remote, it also prevents your dog from getting heartworm and can cure your kids of head lice. But a little-noticed study in the journal Scientific Reports suggests the drug has a major downside: Anywhere from 62 to 98 percent of every dose ends up in \\"highly toxic concentrations\\" in the recipient's droppings, where it eventually gets consumed by dung beetles. When that happens, ivermectin can disrupt a dung beetle's ability to use its antennae to communicate, find a mate, or locate food. Even if the dung beetle could find its way, ivermectin also interferes with the movement of muscles in its forelegs. When ivermectin knocks down the population of dung beetles in a cattle field, an extra 312 pounds of dung can pile up on every acre every year. The study links the drug to the decline of seven dung beetle species across the Iberian Peninsula and by implication to similar declines elsewhere. To which anyone who has ever witnessed a person suffering the horrible effects of river blindness or elephantiasis might well reply, \\"So what?\\" The answer looms larger than we might think: Ivermectin may be doing to dung beetles what DDT did to birds, what diclofenac did to vultures in India, or what neonicotinoid insecticides are thought to be doing to honeybees, now in decline worldwide. Companies keep finding great products to control one big problem without \\"thinking downstream at all,\\" said Sacha Spector, an environmental program director at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. For instance, said Elizabeth Nichols, a Swarthmore College biologist, a healthy dung beetle population rapidly reduces the standing dung heaps that would otherwise host a variety of disease-causing worms. Anything that impairs that ability can inadvertently increase the number of pests and parasites—and thus the diseases that affect some of the poorest people on Earth. \\"It's ironic,\\" she said, \\"when you consider that we blanket large parts of the world with ivermectin\\" to treat diseases. By one estimate, when ivermectin knocks down the population of dung beetles in a cattle field, an extra 312 pounds of dung pile up on every acre every year. More than a quarter of Earth's ice-free land—nearly 8 billion acres—is now being used to graze livestock, which means the great pileup is happening everywhere. And an extra burden of dung makes fields less productive, driving farmers to clear more land for pasturage. So is there anything to be done? An article last year in Progressive Cattleman advised readers to administer ivermectin in injectable form so less of the drug passes through the animal and onto the field—and to use it only during cooler weather when dung beetles are dormant and there may be fewer cattle in the fields. But in warm climates \\"there really isn't a good time to do that,\\" said Norm Conrad, an agricultural specialist. He suggests limiting ivermectin treatment in animals to cases where parasitic infections are severe. That could have the added benefit of delaying the spread of ivermectin resistance, which has already begun to appear in some livestock parasites. Researchers are concerned it might also emerge in parasites that plague humans. People with river blindness infections have to take the drug once or twice a year for up to 18 years for a full cure. Widespread resistance to the drug, just as the world is on the brink of eradicating the disease, would be catastrophic. They might not be as easy to romanticize as honeybees or butterflies flitting from flower to flower, but dung beetles rank high among the little things that run the planet. Given the potential effects of losing them, something about ivermectin no longer smells quite right. ||||| Research led by the University of Alicante's Ibero-American Centre for Biodiversity shows the adverse effects of a drug commonly administered to livestock, ivermectin, on populations of a key dung beetle in Mediterranean ecosystems. A multidisciplinary research team made up of researchers from the Spanish universities of Alicante, Jaen and Granada, the French universities of Montpellier and Paul-Valéry Montpellier, CSIC's National Museum of Natural Sciences and the IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation has analysed the impact of ivermectin on Scarabaeus cicatricosus populations in the Mediterranean. Led by José R. Verdú from the Ibero-American Centre for Biodiversity (CIBIO) at the Universidad de Alicante (University of Alicante, UA), this research shows that arthropods that ingest this substance, even in low doses, become unable to interact with their surroundings since it affects both their olfactory and locomotor capacity. This fact may explain the population decline observed for this dung beetle. The article \\"Low doses of Ivermectin cause sensory and musculoskeletal disorders in dung beetles\\" was published in Scientific Reports in September. Ivermectin is a very effective anti-parasitic drug that has been used as a preventative in livestock since its discovery in 1981. Since then its use has increased exponentially to become a standard drug in the treatment and prevention of common parasites, including in human beings. Considered by the World Health Organization as an essential medication, Verdú points out that, although this drug has proven very effective, its widespread use comes at a price. The issue, researchers have found, is that the ivermectin molecule can survive its journey through the animal and be excreted unchanged. Also, once on the ground, residues can remain active in animal dung for at least a month. This means the drug hits the arthropod populations as hard as it does the parasites it is intended to prevent. It is in this context that Verdú's team draws attention to the declining beetle populations, reporting that the ingestion of ivermectin affects even mature dung beetles, seriously compromising their mobility, orientation and reproductive capacities. These findings contradict international veterinary manuals and yet offer an explanation for thedecline in population levels reported in other research. For this study, researchers used electroantennography, olfactometry and muscle force tests for the first time to obtain measures of the insects' sensory and muscle power. It was carried out in the Doñana Natural Park in southern Spain, testing specimens taken from protected, ivermectin-free sites and land where ivermectin is used. Different rates of decomposition of dung were observed between the two sites, rates being some 30 percent lower in the sites where ivermectin was used. This can be ascribed to the absence of dung beetles as, without them, dung accumulates in the field unprocessed. With populations of beneficial dung feeder species declining over the past 20 to 30 years, \\"the difference between land with beetles and land without is the difference between roughly 350 kilograms of dung per hectare per year that is not being buried in areas affected by ivermectin,\\" the researcher said. So aside from the lethal and sub-lethal effects of ivermectin on dung feeders, the use of this drug has a knock-on effect on the quality of the pasture for livestock, not to mention the irreparable loss of biodiversity in Mediterranean ecosystems. A further consequence is the growth of highly nitrophilous plants, which again are no good for livestock grazing. Researchers also speculate that ivermectin may be present in the food chain, pointing to the insectivorous birds that feed on dung beetles. ||||| Dung beetle behaviour has fascinated humans for thousands of years – including the ancient Egyptians, who incorrectly believed the beetles reproduced only from males. But Egyptian observations that the beetles’ ball rolling is influenced by the sun is accurate and could be the first recorded accounts of animal behaviour. Dung beetles evolved at least 65 million years ago, as the dinosaurs were in decline, and the mammals (and their droppings) were getting bigger. There are about 6000 species worldwide, concentrated in the tropics where they feed mainly on the dung of terrestrial vertebrates. Dung beetles have been cleaning up the planet ever since; but what on earth do they do with all that poo? Here are the top five most interesting. Eat it Vulgar and aggressive, but true. Dung beetles eat dung. But they are fussy eaters, picking out the big bits and concentrating on the tiniest particles, 2-70 microns big (1 micron = 1/1000 of a millimetre), which is where most of the nitrogen in dung is to be found. All organisms need nitrogen to build proteins, such as muscle. Dung beetles get theirs from dung. By eating poo, dung beetles may be selecting the cells from the gut wall of the herbivore which made it. These are a protein-rich nitrogen source. The latest studies show that obesity and diabetes in humans might be linked to our individual gut microbiomes. Dung beetles might be using their gut microbiome to help them digest the difficult components of dung. Roll it – although only a minority do 90% of dung beetles tunnel directly beneath the dung pat and make an underground nest of brood balls in which they lay eggs. You’ll never see them unless you are prepared to poke around in the stuff. On the other hand, the rollers transport their prize on the soil surface. They use celestial cues such as the sun or the moon to keep to a straight track away from competitors that might steal their ball. There is one species which has been shown how to use the stars of the Milky Way as its celestial compass, allowing it to dominate the midnight market in dung transport. Make a packed lunch This is what the brood ball represents to the larval dung beetle. Hatching from a single egg inside each brood ball, the larva eats its way around the interior of the ball. This dung is coarse and crunchy, so the larva has chewing mouthparts not found in the adult beetle, and doesn’t have the luxury of selecting what it can eat or discard, so it eats everything – several times. Therefore, its microbiome is different from their parents’, and might contain symbiotic microorganisms living in a mutually beneficial relationship with the host larva. That gives the larva access to sugars in otherwise indigestible cellulose, and may even “fix” nitrogen from the atmosphere. Marcus Byrne Woo girlfriends All that is needed is a small ball of poo. Place the poo at the base of a short tunnel, then retreat to the entrance where you stick your bum in to the air and release a pheromone which alerts nearby female beetles that you have a juicy prize for them. This is in return for sexual favours. Pheromones are chemical messengers, which leave the body and are often associated with sexual attraction. But sometimes the males cheat. They make the tunnel, do the head-standing trick to lure a naïve female, who after succumbing to his wiles discovers that males are not to be trusted – even the six-legged versions. Chill on it On a hot day in the Kalahari the soil surface can reach 60°C, which is death to any animal that can’t control its body temperature. Dung beetles are small, and so is their thermal inertia. Consequently they heat up very rapidly. To avoid overheating while rolling their balls in the blazing midday sun, they climb on top of the ball to momentarily cool off, before hot-footing across the sand looking for shade. Giving them chilled dung balls from the fridge allows them to roll further before going back onto the ball. Heated balls have the opposite effect. And giving them insulating silicon boots lets them tolerate high temperatures for longer, showing that the dung ball is used as a thermal refuge from the heat. Each example shows how evolution has co-opted a single, seemingly odd behaviour of eating dung into a more sophisticated use of the same material in different roles, each of which have enhanced the animal’s survival. This ranges from making nuptial gifts to thermal refuges. Those beetles that discovered these new behaviours by accident had more offspring, bearing their slightly different genes and behaviour into the next generation. This is where they became entrenched as an evolutionary adaptation to a successful way of life at the back-end of the food chain. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Dung beetles are very helpful because they clean poop from the environment, which helps in many ways, like making room for animals to graze, keeping the soil healthy, and even lessening gases that warm our planet. But, dung beetles are having a hard time because of changes we're making to their homes and because we're giving a medicine called ivermectin to animals. This medicine is great for treating animals and even people with certain diseases, but when the animals poop, the medicine is still there, and when dung beetles eat this poop, they can get very sick. They can have trouble moving, smelling, and even finding mates. Without dung beetles, a lot of poop will accumulate that is bad for the environment. Scientists are suggesting we change how we use this medicine by injecting it directly into the animals or using it less often. They're worried that if we don't make changes, we could lose dung beetles completely, which would be bad for our planet. In the meantime, dung beetles will continue to do their job of cleaning up for us, eating and rolling poop, even using it to attract mates or cool off in hot weather. While they may seem strange to us, dung beetles are truly important for Earth's health."},{"prompt":"Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

Answer:","completion":"The information provided above is about Carlos Echeverri Cortés, a Colombian economist, diplomat, and politician. He was the Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations and held various other political positions in Colombia, including the Colombian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Born on June 23, 1900, in Bogotá, Colombia, Carlos Echeverri Cortés was educated at the University of London and later became a respected economist. He was married to Gloria Rodríguez García and passed away on March 14, 1974, in Bogotá, Colombia. During his career, Echeverri Cortés had multiple successors at different points, such as Evaristo Sourdis Juliao, Carlos Albornoz, and Eduardo Zuleta Ángel. His terms in office had varying start and end dates, with his term as Permanent Representative of Colombia to the United Nations lasting from August 1952 to March 1953. As a member of the Conservative party in Colombia, Echeverri Cortés was deeply involved in national politics, following in the footsteps of others like Roberto Mariano Ospina Pérez, Urdaneta Arbeláez, Laureano Gómez Castro, and Roberto Urdaneta Arbeláez, who have all been Presidents of Colombia. His predecessors in various roles included Elíseo Arango Ramos and José Tomás Angulo. Carlos Echeverri Cortés' work and contributions were not limited to Colombia, as he represented his country at the United Nations. His position as Permanent Representative made him an ambassador from Colombia to this international organization.

As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people.

PUBLISHED:. 07:59 EST, 4 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:04 EST, 4 November 2012. A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed. The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere. Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly. 'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added.","completion":"1.

Q:Given the following context: Maura is a down on her luck single mother who's facing eviction from her house, which lead her to the rash decision to marry an illegal immigrant, Wilson, in exchange of €9,000. Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce. The receptions for both weddings are being held in the same hotel. Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters, two immigration officers arrive at the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson. Believing her suspicions of an affair to be true, Sophie flees the wedding. Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie. Meanwhile, Sophie has gone to a pub in Dublin with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous cheater. Sophie gets drunk with her new friends while Freddie is frantically trying to find her to keep his marriage afloat. It is revealed that one of the reasons for their original breakup wasn't Sophie's mental state, as insinuated, but Freddie's nervous breakdown for his inability to deal with Sophie. Facing ruin and a new divorce, Freddie tries to take his own life by throwing himself off the top floor of the hotel. However, just as he is about to jump, Maura steps in and talks him down from the ledge.

In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.

Would \\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation .\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"That statement (\\"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation.\\") is a correct definition of burns, but it doesn't answer the question about when to go to a burn center. A more appropriate answer would be: To determine whether a burn is severe enough to require treatment at a burn center, you should consider the following criteria: 1. Depth of the burn: Burns are classified into three degrees of severity: a. First-degree burns: These only affect the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and usually heal well without medical intervention. b. Second-degree burns: These affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin (the dermis). They might require treatment at a burn center if they are deep, extensive, or present on critical body areas (face, hands, etc.). c. Third-degree burns: These burns destroy both layers of skin along with nerves, blood vessels, and other tissues. They are critical to treat at a burn center as soon as possible. 2. Size of the burn: Larger burns (covering more than 10% of the body surface area in adults or 5% in children) typically need advanced care, which burn centers can provide. 3. Location of the burn: If the burn is in critical areas such as the face, hands, feet, or joints, it may be best to seek treatment from a burn center regardless of the burn's degree. 4. Presence of additional injuries: Burns accompanied by trauma or medical complications, such as broken bones or respiratory distress, should also be treated at a burn center. 5. High-risk populations: Children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems may benefit from the specialized care available at burn centers, even for less severe burns. When in doubt, it's best to seek professional medical advice to determine the appropriate course of action for treating a burn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a question about the following article: With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.","completion":"Why did the Iroquois decide to attack the Susquehannock tribe after defeating the tribes in the north and west, and how did the English colony of Maryland get involved in the conflict between the two tribes?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","completion":"In Russia, HEU will be processed and converted into LEU, thus eliminating the possibility of using it in bomb production. Detailed answer: In Russia, the Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) will undergo a process to be converted into Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU). This conversion is a significant step in ensuring the reduction of nuclear weapon proliferation, as it diminishes the possibility of utilizing the uranium for bomb production. Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) contains a higher percentage of the isotope U-235, usually over 20%, and is primarily used in the production of nuclear weapons. In contrast, Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) contains less than 20% U-235 and is typically used in nuclear reactors for power generation. The process of converting HEU to LEU involves down-blending the uranium, thereby reducing the concentration of U-235 and making it unsuitable for nuclear weapon applications. As part of international efforts to promote non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, various programs and agreements have been established to encourage countries like Russia to convert their excess stockpiles of HEU into LEU. One such example is the Megatons to Megawatts Program, which was a joint initiative between the United States and Russia that aimed to down-blend Russian HEU into LEU for use in US commercial nuclear power plants. This program not only reduced the availability of weapons-grade material but also provided economic incentives for Russia by turning a potential threat into a valuable energy resource. Therefore, the conversion of HEU into LEU in Russia plays a pivotal role in preventing the usage of this material in bomb production and promoting a more secure international landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Comisia este rugată să acorde o atenție sporită în ceea ce privește implementarea acestei politici și să analizeze posibilitatea introducerii acesteia într-un mod care să permită aderarea voluntară a celor implicați în proces. Este esențial ca orice decizie luată în acest sens să țină cont de nevoile, interesele și preocupările multiple ale membrilor și actorilor implicați, asigurându-se astfel că politica în cauză este adaptată în mod corespunzător cazurilor individuale și sectoriale. Introducerea unei astfel de politici pe bază voluntară în locul unei abordări obligatorii ar putea avea numeroase beneficii. În primul rând, un astfel de cadru ar permite organizatorilor și instituțiilor din diferite sectoare să evalueze și să se alinieze în mod eficient cu noile schimbări și cerințe. Astfel, în cazul în care o companie sau o organizație se confruntă cu provocări și obstacole specifice în implementarea acestei politici, procesul de adaptare și ajustare se va desfășura mai ușor și fără a crea riscuri sau presiuni nerezonabile. În al doilea rând, o abordare pe bază voluntară ar facilita evaluarea impactului politicii și identificarea modalităților în care aceasta poate fi perfecționată. De exemplu, în cazul în care un grup restrâns de organizații decide să adopte politica într-o fază pilot, ea poate genera informații și feed-back valoros privind aplicarea și impactul acesteia asupra diferitelor sectoare și activități. Aceste informații ar putea fi apoi folosite pentru a ajusta și adapta politica înainte de a o extinde la un public mai larg. În al treilea rând, o implementare voluntară ar putea contribui la creșterea gradului de acceptare și susținere a politicii în rândul tuturor actorilor implicați. Dacă oamenii și instituțiile consideră că au posibilitatea de a lua decizia cu privire la aplicarea politicii pe baza propriilor nevoi și circumstanțe și nu ca urmare a unei obligații impuse de o autoritate centrală, acest lucru poate contribui la o mai mare disponibilitate în a susține și a răspunde la provocările și cerințele politicii. În concluzie, reconsiderarea politicii și introducerea acesteia într-un cadru voluntar este o recomandare echilibrată și flexibilă, care ia în considerare necesitatea de a adapta măsurile și soluțiile politice la realitățile diferitelor sectoare și situații. Este crucial ca Comisia să analizeze cu atenție această posibilitate și să se asigure că opțiunile și procedurile adoptate sunt în interesul comun al tuturor părților implicate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton (; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress, and model. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R.

Many adults feel less self-conscious to be seen reading, enjoying and appreciating it. There has been interesting and complex children's and young adult fiction for quite some time, but in terms of the consumer landscape and people's attitudes, I think Harry Potter had a lot to do with it. There has been a tendency to make assumptions about the books, to deem them as simplistic. But now, people are seeing their complexity. The idea of the 'beautiful jungle' sprung to mind because it's a place of excitement, danger, beauty - and the unexpected. We have published seven books by her and to now get properly recognised in this way, because Costa is one of the largest awards, feels amazing. I think Frances does share some things with Philip Pullman, in that what she writes appeals to children and appeals to adults. They are adult books, but the main character happens to be a child of 14. You get adults and children picking up the books. I hope that Frances will reach a much broader audience. Children's books do tend to get less mainstream coverage than adult books, so when something like this happens, it's incredibly important. We really need to help parents, teachers and children themselves to have access to quality literature and find out about it. So anything that engages them, inspires them and gets them to read is really important. The wider world is realising what people within children's publishing have known for a while - which is that the quality and output is getting better, year on year. I don't think we're necessarily going to see children's and young adult books winning more adult book prizes, but in terms of people recognising the quality of children's literature, that will happen more often and people will pay more attention to children and young adult book prizes - there are so many of them. As CS Lewis said, 'A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest' - and I think that's definitely the case. For far too long, people have had this idea in their heads that children's and teenagers' literature was somehow inferior. But the children's market has grown more quickly than the adult book market and hasn't been affected by the digital drive. Hopefully, we will see more and more people recognising the quality of a really great children's book. YA fiction has been dismissed as 'issue lit', but The Lie Tree shows it can be incredibly varied and very diverse. It can be very difficult for children's books to go up against adult books, but The Lie Tree has a wider appeal beyond younger readers. In the UK in particular, we have such a rich heritage of children's books, going all the way back to Alice in Wonderland - there is such a rich seam, and some of the very best books are actually for children. Now, in terms of writing and production, children's publishers have really stepped up to the plate. The Fox and the Star was about the quality and the beautiful design, while the Lie Tree is really about the storytelling and richness. But I honestly don't know if I think it's going to be less rare for them to win such awards. I have definitely noticed within the industry there's a lot more respect for children's publishing and children's book selling as a crucial part of the market. Children's books are selling so well, that people have been paying more attention.\\" I feel that a story is a story, regardless of age, and this is something that has been recognised this year by the Costa awards, which is fantastic. I don't think it's the case it makes the genre more credible, it's just that other parts of the book publishing industry are realising that there is an inventiveness, enjoyment and profundity in these books which appeals to readers. The books have to stand up to being read many times, and have layers of meaning, and it's something that the industry now realises. There was such a big gap between the last children's book winning Costa book of the year and now, so we can only hope there will now be more. And to have two awards for children in a short space of time is great.\\" I think Frances' prize is such a brilliant thing for young adult fiction. For me, YA has been the biggest success story of the publishing industry over the past 25 years. Publishers were aware because of the sales figures, and young readers were aware, but it never got the critical attention it merited. This [Costa award] has forced people to sit up and take notice of how great this fiction is. There's been a traditional view in certain quarters that writing for children or teenagers is easier than writing for adults. Having done both, I can say it isn't. There can also be a view it isn't 'proper' literature, but anyone who reads it would be surprised at just how good the books are - they aren't inferior in literary terms. But it takes a long time for these attitudes to disappear. I hope if enough of these books come to the public's attention, it will gradually erode this misconceived ideas. It could be another 15 years before another children's book wins the Costa award - but it's a step in the right direction and will lead to more awareness.","completion":"Recently, a children's book won a big award for the second time ever. This happened more than 10 years after the first time. People who write and work with children's books think this is great because it shows that these books can be just as good as books for grown-ups. They believe that more people should read and enjoy children's books, no matter how old they are. Some people used to think that children's books were simpler and not as interesting as adult books, but now they are changing their minds and understanding that children's books can also be complex and exciting. This could help children's books get more attention and be more popular in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The life of 15th century French serial killer Gilles de Rais is believed to be the basis of which story by Charles Perrault?","completion":"The life of Gilles de Rais, a 15th century French serial killer, is believed to be the basis for the story \\"Bluebeard\\" by Charles Perrault. This French literary fairy tale, published in 1697 as \\"La Barbe bleue\\" in \\"Histoires ou Contes du temps passé, avec des moralités,\\" features a wealthy, aristocratic man with a blue beard who has been married several times, but whose previous wives have all mysteriously vanished. Similarities between Gilles de Rais and Bluebeard are numerous and striking, making a connection between the two figures quite plausible. Gilles de Rais was born in 1404 into a wealthy family with multiple castles and lands in Brittany, France. Raised by his grandmother after he was orphaned, he became a page and squire, eventually joining the French army under the command of Joan of Arc. Following successful military campaigns, he was made Marshal of France. Throughout his life, de Rais had a keen interest in art, theatre, alchemy, and other intellectual pursuits. However, his excessive spending plunged him into financial turmoil, and he was forced to sell some of his properties. In 1440, Gilles de Rais was arrested and later convicted for the abduction, torture, and murder of dozens, if not hundreds, of children—many of whom were boys from lower social classes. He was executed by hanging and burning in 1440 at the age of 36. The gruesome details of his murderous deeds, which involved luring young victims into his castle, mirror Bluebeard's actions in Perrault's story. In \\"Bluebeard,\\" the titular character marries a beautiful, young woman after having been rejected by other ladies due to his blue beard—a symbol of evil and deception. In the story, he leaves his new wife in charge of their castle and provides her with a set of keys, but forbids her from using one particular key to unlock a room. Out of curiosity, the wife disobeys and discovers the corpses of Bluebeard's previous wives, revealing his dark secrets. The plot unfolds as the wife desperately attempts to escape the wrath of Bluebeard, leading to the climactic moment when her brothers save her and put an end to Bluebeard's violent acts. Considering the historical context and eerie similarities between Gilles de Rais and the character Bluebeard, it is widely believed that Perrault took inspiration from the life of the notorious 15th-century French serial killer to create his dark and cautionary tale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222 August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258. - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek : ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s . - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city. - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina (). - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

(AP) — Police are searching for a 6-year-old boy who is believed to have wandered away from his home in suburban Denver on New Year's Eve, authorities said. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies helped in the hunt for David Puckett on Monday, going door-to-door within 2.5 miles of his home in Aurora. Bloodhounds and a helicopter have also been used. An Amber Alert was issued and police said a 10,000 reward was offered. Aurora police appealed for help to find David as quickly as possible partly because of coming cold weather, with lows expected in the upper teens. \\"The public can help by physically searching their homes, automobiles, and any structures on their property where a child may be able to hide,\\" a police statement said. Authorities have said that foul play isn't suspected, but they said they have contacted registered sex offenders who live in the area and have searched nearby bodies of water. Monday evening, police disclosed that someone outside the family had seen the boy the day he went missing, but they didn't elaborate. The FBI told the Denver Post that the agency assigned 50 agents to the case, including one who is highly specialized in missing children searches. His mother on Sunday issued a tearful appeal for people to help find him and said he was only wearing a light jacket. Police said David has wandered off before. ||||| Police and FBI officers intensified their search Monday for a missing 6-year-old Aurora boy who police say wandered away from home on New Year’s Eve as the temperature was expected to drop into the upper teens. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber alert Monday for David Puckett because of the cold weather and the amount of time the boy has been missing, Aurora police spokesman Crystal McCoy said. As night fell Monday, police held a news briefing as FBI agents again canvassed the neighborhood where the boy lived with his family, which includes three juvenile siblings. Authorities planned to continue their search well into the night, McCoy said. David disappeared from his home in the 15700 block of Amherst Avenue around 5:30 p.m. New Year’s Eve. Some family members were home, McCoy said. She did not disclose who was there. Police also said someone outside the family had seen the boy the day he went missing, but McCoy did not elaborate on who that was or where or when the sighting was made. The family searched for David for an hour before calling Aurora police. And the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office had its bloodhound on the trail within an hour of Aurora police receiving the call, McCoy said. There has been no indication that police have found any sign of David since the search began. Although police said they have no indication of foul play, officials emphasized the investigation was ongoing, McCoy said. The FBI joined the investigation because of the increased resources the bureau can provide. The FBI has assigned 50 agents to the case, including one who is highly specialized in missing children searches, said Deborah Sherman, an FBI spokeswoman. The FBI has set up a command post although Aurora police remains the lead agency in the search. More than 100 officers joined the searched on Monday, including the Arapahoe County water rescue team and officers from area police and sheriffs departments. Police have contacted registered sex offenders who live in the area and have searched nearby bodies of water looking for any signs of cracked ice, McCoy said. Police and FBI agents canvassed neighborhoods and set up checkpoints to notify motorists of the search. David’s family has cooperated with police, who have searched the family home multiple times, McCoy said. On Monday evening, the CBI issued a statement about the decision to issue an Amber Alert three days after the boy was first reported missing. While the circumstances surrounding David’s disappearance have not changed, the bureau decided to activate the alert out of an abundance of caution. The alert is one tool that can be used to disseminate information that already has been released about the boy and his disappearance, the CBI statement said. The statement praised Aurora police, saying that department “has been exceptional” in using the media and social media to relay information about the search. Aurora police have said they consulted with the CBI about a possible Amber Alert since the child first was reported missing. However, David’s disappearance had not met the criteria for Amber Alert notifications. The CBI will continue to communicate with Aurora police and provide resources as needed, the statement said. Earlier Monday, volunteers were called to join the search, which has been confined to a 2.5-mile area. By mid-afternoon, police had asked volunteers to stop looking for Puckett because their efforts could disrupt the work of the bloodhounds who were on the trail again. “We are continuing to do thorough searches of the neighborhood,” McCoy said. “We will notify people once again when we’re ready for the community to start searching.” Authorities were also looking for residential and commercial video to aid in their investigation, McCoy said. She asked anyone who finds any evidence that they think could be related to David’s disappearance to call police rather than pick items up or post images of them on social media. Police were growing more concerned Monday night as the search extended beyond 48 hours and with temperatures headed toward the teens. The boy was not appropriately dressed to be out all night in freezing temperatures. David attends Dartmouth Elementary, where he wandered away once before. Previous reports that the boy had wandered away from home more than once do not appear to be true. McCoy said Aurora Public Schools were making mental health professionals available to staff and students. “At this time we believed he wandered off,” McCoy said. “We have one documented instance where he wandered off from school.” Aurora police Chief Nick Metz said on Sunday there was no evidence of a kidnapping. “That could change as the investigation moves forward,” Metz said. David is about 4 feet tall and weighs 48 pounds. He has light brown hair and blue-green eyes. He was last seen wearing green camouflage pants, a black T-shirt, orange boots and a tan girl’s coat, according to police. The boy’s mother made a tearful plea Sunday for the public’s help, emphasizing that the coat was not very thick. “If you guys can, please help me find him. If you see him, please call the police immediately. If, by chance, you picked him up last night because you thought it would be best please bring my baby home,” she said. Aurora police are asking those with information to call any of their tip lines: 303-739-1865, 303-739-1868 or 303-739-1870. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A 6-year-old boy named David Puckett went missing in Aurora, Colorado, on New Year's Eve and is believed to have wandered away from his home.

Q: The grasp reflex in humans is an example of what kind of behavior? Choices: - habit - inclination - trait - innate A: Answer:","completion":"The grasp reflex in humans is an example of innate behavior. Innate behaviors are those that are genetically predetermined and appear in an individual's repertoire without the need for learning or prior experience. Such behaviors are present from birth and are crucial for the survival and development of the organism. The grasp reflex, also known as the palmar grasp reflex, is a primitive reflex observed in infants. When an object is placed in an infant's palm or their hand is gently stroked, the infant's fingers will involuntarily close around the object or the stimulating finger. This reflex serves the essential purpose of ensuring that infants are able to hold onto their caregiver or objects for support and safety. Innate behaviors differ from habits, inclinations, and traits in several ways: 1. Habits are acquired behaviors that develop over time through repeated actions or experiences. They are not present from birth and require learning and conditioning to form. Innate behaviors, on the other hand, do not require learning or prior experience. 2. Inclinations refer to a natural tendency or predisposition to behave in a certain manner or to have a certain preference. While they may have some genetic basis, inclinations are often influenced by an individual's environment or learned experiences. Innate behaviors, however, are solely determined by genetics and are not influenced by the environment or experience. 3. Traits are characteristics or qualities that mark an individual's personality, temperament, or physical attributes. Traits can be influenced by genetic factors, as well as environmental factors and personal experiences. Innate behaviors, in contrast, are solely determined by an individual's genetic makeup and are not influenced by external factors. In conclusion, the grasp reflex in humans is an example of an innate behavior because it is present from birth and requires no learning or prior experience. This genetically predetermined behavior is essential for the survival and development of the infant, as it enables them to securely hold onto their caregiver or objects for support and safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: Dog walkers have been ordered to bin their pet's waste after a deer's stomach was found to be full of plastic poo bags at a park in Leicestershire. Article:","completion":"Title: Poo Bag Usage Urged for Dog Walkers After Deer Found With Stomach Full of Plastic Bags in Leicestershire Park Introduction: Dog walkers in Leicestershire are now being strictly advised to use the bins provided to dispose of their pet's waste, after a distressing incident took place at a local park. The issue gained attention when a deer was discovered, its stomach filled with plastic poop bags. The incident has highlighted the importance of proper pet waste disposal for ensuring the well-being of the environment and safety of local wildlife. (Step 1: Start with an attention-grabbing title and a brief introduction) First Section: Importance of Waste Disposal Proper disposal of dog waste plays a crucial role in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in public spaces. It prevents the spread of diseases, while also safeguarding wildlife and the environment from the hazards of plastic pollution. The irresponsible actions of some dog walkers, such as leaving plastic poo bags in parks and green spaces, can lead to dire consequences for park ecosystems and their inhabitants. (Step 2: Discuss the importance of waste disposal) Second Section: Impact of Plastic Waste on Wildlife Leicestershire parkgoers were stunned and concerned when a deer was found with a stomach full of plastic poo bags. Plastics, especially discarded bags, pose significant dangers to wildlife like deer, who may accidentally consume them while grazing on vegetation. Having a stomach full of plastic can be fatal for animals, as it causes digestive blockages and even chemical poisoning. (Step 3: Highlight the impact of plastic waste on wildlife) Third Section: Consequences of Ignoring Park Rules Besides the detrimental environmental and wildlife impact, disregarding the park's rules on waste disposal can result in fines for dog owners. Various parks in Leicestershire have placed bins specially designed for disposing of pet waste, but some individuals continue to ignore these facilities. Strict enforcement of these regulations is essential to prevent similar incidents from occurring. (Step 4: Mention consequences for dog owners who ignore park rules) Fourth Section: Encouraging Responsible Dog Ownership Responsible dog owners must ensure that they are carrying poo bags and use park-provided bins to dispose of their pet's waste correctly. To further foster responsible dog ownership within the community, parks could organize educational events that engage and inform the public about proper waste disposal practices. Additionally, reminders and signage around the parks can serve as a prompt for dog walkers to adhere to the rules and care for the environment. (Step 5: Promote responsible dog ownership and suggest improvements) Conclusion: The unfortunate incident of the deer found with a stomach full of plastic poo bags in Leicestershire serves as a stark reminder to dog walkers about the importance of responsible pet waste disposal. Proper waste management not only benefits the environment but also safeguards the well-being of wildlife living within these shared public spaces. It falls upon every dog owner to ensure that the parks remain clean and safe for everyone to enjoy.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding Now, I have a new situation: In the sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria, there are two main species that tend to travel in groups. The antelope tend to travel in groups in high numbers, and thus exhibit a high density. Meanwhile, the bison tend to travel in groups of small numbers, and therefore exhibit low density. Both the antelope and the bison have natural predators that exist in Nigeria. Answer this question please: Individuals from which species, the antelope or the bison, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior? Answer:","completion":"In the scenario provided, the antelope and bison are both species that reside in Nigeria and have natural predators. To determine which of these species will exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior, we need to consider the information provided about their group density and the concept of aggregation. Aggregation, or group formation, has been postulated to serve as a defense mechanism against predation. The more individuals present in a group, the more effective it becomes for the species to hinder or avoid the attention of predators. There are different strategies used by the species, such as shared vigilance (as in the example of meerkats), or synchronized movement leading to the confusion effect (like schools of sardines and flocks of starlings). It is stated that many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. In the context of the Nigeria example, antelopes tend to travel in high numbers, resulting in a high-density group. In contrast, bison travel in smaller groups, resulting in a low-density group. Based on the information provided, we can infer that individuals from the bison species, which travel in smaller, low-density groups, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual. This is because the smaller groups lead to each bison needing to be more vigilant about predators, potentially due to the reduced effectiveness of the confusion effect or a lower likelihood of shared vigilance among individuals. Although this increased vigilance may help bison detect and avoid predators more effectively, it should be noted that it might also result in trade-offs, such as reduced foraging efficiency. The energy and time spent on increased vigilance may detract from other crucial activities like feeding, which could ultimately influence the overall fitness of these individuals in the long run. In conclusion, individuals from the bison species, which travel in low-density groups, are more likely to exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual in comparison to the high-density antelope groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. [substeps] This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (aaa) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There are ways to tell if triangles are similar","completion":"Yes, the next sentence follows given the preceding text. In the context of discussing the Angle-Angle (AA) or Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) theorem, the statement \\"There are ways to tell if triangles are similar\\" is relevant as it introduces various methods to prove the similarity of triangles. To provide a detailed and long answer on proving similar triangles and understanding the angle-angle (AA) theorem, let us discuss additional ways of proving triangle similarity and elaborate on the AA theorem. 1. Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem: The AA theorem states that if two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then those triangles are similar. Since the sum of interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees, knowing two angles are congruent in each triangle automatically implies that the third angle must be congruent as well. Hence, it is also called the Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) theorem. To use this theorem for proving two triangles to be similar: a. Identify the pairs of congruent angles in both triangles. b. Ensure the angles are in the same positions in their respective triangles. c. Conclude that the triangles are similar based on the AA theorem. 2. Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity Theorem: The Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity theorem states that if the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, then those triangles are similar. If all three sides of one triangle have the same ratio of lengths as the three sides of another triangle, the triangles are similar. To use the SSS theorem to prove similarity: a. Identify the corresponding side pairs of the triangles. b. Check whether the side lengths are proportional by finding the ratio between each pair of sides. c. If all three ratios are equal, conclude that the triangles are similar using the SSS theorem. 3. Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Theorem: The SAS Similarity theorem states that if an angle of one triangle is congruent to an angle of another triangle and the sides including that angle are proportional, then those triangles are similar. To use the SAS theorem to prove similarity: a. Identify the congruent angle pairs and the pairs of sides that include the congruent angles in both triangles. b. Check whether the side lengths including the congruent angles are proportional by finding the ratio between each pair of sides. c. If the ratio is equal and the included angles are congruent, conclude that the triangles are similar using the SAS theorem. In conclusion, given the Angle-Angle (AA) theorem, the following sentence \\"There are ways to tell if triangles are similar\\" is valid and correlates with the previous text. To prove that two triangles are similar, you can use one of the three primary methods: Angle-Angle (AA) theorem, Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity theorem, or Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity theorem. Understanding these methods will enable you to determine the similarity between triangles effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She was consistently under pressure to maintain a high level of efficiency due to the high demands of her workplace. Nevertheless, she loved her job, as she believed that her work made a positive impact on countless lives. Katrina's small-town hospital, on the other hand, catered to a much smaller and more close-knit community. While the medical issues she encountered were typically less complex, Katrina appreciated the relationships she formed with her patients and their families, which provided her with a sense of connection and belonging that was sometimes lacking in larger medical facilities. The slower pace also allowed her to offer patients more personal and holistic care, as she was frequently able to spend more time with each individual and engage more deeply in their health journey. Despite the differences in scale, both Megan and Katrina shared a fierce commitment to providing the best care possible for their patients. They each found satisfaction in their respective working environments, valuing the unique aspects they were able to bring to their roles. Megan thrived on the intensity and range of challenges she faced daily, and her ability to learn and grow was amplified by the cutting-edge technology and highly skilled team that surrounded her. Katrina esteemed her ability to genuinely connect with her patients and their families, becoming a beloved and recognized figure within her community. Their professional paths would occasionally intersect, as they attended conferences together and sought to advance their knowledge and skills through continuous training programs.

And they are in House of Cards.\\" (Some of the show's stars have shared their pick for president.) Article:","completion":"Equal Pay on the Cards: Robin Wright Empowers Change in House of Cards Robin Wright made headlines when she revealed during an event in New York on Tuesday that she had threatened to go public if she wasn't given the same pay as her House of Cards co-star, Kevin Spacey. Wright, who plays Claire Underwood on the popular Netflix series, had found herself in a unique paradigm, with her character becoming as prominent, if not more, as her fictional husband, Frank Underwood. Upon discovering her character's popularity, she decided it was time to capitalize on it and fight for equal pay, with the star earning around 420,000 per episode in 2015 as opposed to Spacey's 500,000. The demand for equal pay has been a hot topic in Hollywood and other industries in recent years. In this instance, Wright used her character’s strong impact on the show as leverage in negotiating her salary increase. Her role is vital to the storyline, as the show focuses on the power dynamics between Claire and Frank Underwood. For House of Cards to maintain its credibility and authenticity, it was crucial for Netflix to acknowledge their characters' equal weight and popularity, and as a result, offer Wright the compensation she rightfully deserved. Wright's stand against pay disparity reflects the ongoing growth of the feminist movement across various workplaces, where women are actively questioning and fighting against the systemic gender pay gap. According to a 2019 report by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), women earned 82 percent of what men earned, with the pay gap being even more significant for women of color. The pressure from high-profile actresses such as Robin Wright, Jennifer Lawrence, and Patricia Arquette demanding pay equity continues to push the entertainment industry to address these disparities. Robin Wright's exploit has further implications than just her own salary negotiations. Her actions have helped inspire and highlight the need for women to demand equal pay, both within the entertainment industry and beyond. For these demands to produce truly tangible results, society needs to place more importance on understanding, listening to, and valuing women's perspectives and contributions. Only by embracing these changes can we forge a path towards pay equity and gender equality. Drawing inspiration from Wright's character Claire Underwood, we can recognize and celebrate the growing influence of strong female characters on television, film, and across various sectors. As more women step up and fight for equal pay, we demonstrate the collective strength of the feminist movement, embodying the courage and determination of characters like Claire Underwood. In conclusion, Robin Wright's demand for equal pay on House of Cards signifies a much-needed shift in how the entertainment industry and society address gender pay disparities. With more women standing up for their rights and the increasing number of strong female characters on screen, we pave the way for a future where pay equity is a reality for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk. Which milk would not require added lactic acid bacteria, bottle B or bottle C? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we'll examine the process of making curd and the characteristics of each bottle of milk. Step 1: Understand the process of making curd Curd is formed by fermenting milk using lactic acid bacteria. These bacteria convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, which causes the milk proteins to coagulate and form curd. Step 2: Examine the characteristics of each bottle of milk Bottle A: Pasteurized milk (no curd-making process applied) Bottle B: Pasteurized milk turned into curd Bottle C: Raw milk turned into curd Step 3: Analyze milk types based on bacterial content Pasteurized milk undergoes a process that kills harmful bacteria and extends the shelf life of the milk. However, it also destroys the beneficial lactic acid bacteria needed for making curd. So, additional lactic acid bacteria must be introduced to make curd from pasteurized milk. Raw milk, on the other hand, contains the necessary lactic acid bacteria naturally. Therefore, it doesn't require added bacteria to ferment the milk and make curd. Step 4: Compare bottle B and bottle C Since bottle B is made from pasteurized milk, it would require added lactic acid bacteria to make curd. On the other hand, bottle C, made from raw milk, doesn't need any additional bacteria for curd formation.

The inhabitants of Earth I released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Earth II, however, was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet didn't cause a reduction in wildlife population? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Earth II is the planet that didn't cause a reduction in wildlife population. This planet was much more conscious about the environment and protected it from anthropogenic changes, unlike Earth I, where the inhabitants released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As stated in the hint, the release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, has significant adverse effects on the planet and its natural environment. These gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, trapping heat inside the Earth's atmosphere due to their complex molecular structure. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that this warming contributes to the extinction of natural habitats and, consequently, a reduction in wildlife population. In contrast, Earth II was more environmentally conscious and avoided harmful human-made changes. As a result, the planet presumably did not experience the same detrimental effects of global warming and habitat loss as Earth I did. Therefore, Earth II did not cause a reduction in wildlife population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"? is inside the article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\"., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"After analyzing the given article, the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\" is Handel.

Answer the following question: Information: - A major organ of the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or pars anterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, reproduction and lactation. Proper functioning of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via blood tests that measure hormone levels. - Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on there may be no symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goitre. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves disease and nontoxic nodular goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, regardless of whether or not hypothyroidism is present, can be treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goitre. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goitre. Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects about 5% of the population at some point in their life. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50 and is much more common in women than men. Rates of disease appear to be increasing. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912. In 1957 it was recognized as an autoimmune disorder. - Biography. He was born on May 5, 1881, in the village of Midai, Nishitsuge, in Mie Prefecture. He graduated from Kyushu University medical school in 1907. He then entered the First Surgical Bureau and studied medicine under the direction of Professor Hayari Miyake (18671945), the first Japanese neurosurgeon. Some years after, he studied pathology under Professor Eduard Kaufmann at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. He also studied in England. As World War I was about to break out, he was forced to return home to Japan. In 1916, he came back to his hometown, Igamachi, and became the town doctor. He fell ill with typhoid fever and died at home on January 9, 1934. - Hypothyroidism , often called underactive thyroid or low thyroid and sometimes hypothyreosis , is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone . It can cause a number of symptoms , such as poor ability to tolerate cold , a feeling of tiredness , and weight gain . In children , hypothyroidism leads to delays in growth and intellectual development , which is called cretinism in severe cases . Worldwide , too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism . In countries with enough iodine in the diet , the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Less common causes include the following : previous treatment with radioactive iodine , injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland , certain medications , a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth , or previous thyroid surgery . The diagnosis of hypothyroidism , when suspected , can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and thyroxine levels . Hypothyroidism can be treated with manufactured levothyroxine ; the dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels . In Western countries , hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3 -- 0.4 % of people while subclinical hypothyroidism , a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level , is thought to occur in 4.3 -- 8.5 % of people . Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism and in rare cases cats and horses can also have the disorder . The word hypothyroidism is from hypo - meaning under or reduced , plus thyroid . - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.

Q: Passage: Early in the Global War on Terror, Fontes served at US Central Command J5 overseeing issues of political-military cooperation in Afghanistan. In June 2004, she was moved to Combined Forces Command - Afghanistan headquarters in Kabul and served under David Barno as the head of the CJ5 staff for political-military coordination. Her staff was responsible for keeping General Barno \\"on message\\", overseeing the policies impacting military operations, and performing liaison work with both the Afghan Ministry of Defense and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. At the end of her first year in Afghanistan and following Karl Eikenberry's assumption of command from Barno, Fontes volunteered to lead the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Tarinkot. Daniel Green, the political adviser for the PRT, reported that though some Soldiers at the PRT had initial concerns due to her gender, those worries were shortly put to rest. She had been active in engaging with the Afghan people. Green said that Fontes, then a Lieutenant Colonel, pitched in a few hundred dollars of her own money to host a lunch on the PRT for local Afghan leaders. An article in Vanity Fair relates a story that she once refused to depart a meeting with Afghan elders in Chora District under threat of small arms fire, for fear of appearing weak in the face of the Taliban. Green asserts that in early 2006, she survived the first suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in Urozgan Province due in part to the device's failure to detonate all of the mortar shells of which it was comprised. She departed Afghanistan in May 2006 to attend the US War College, graduating in 2007. She had been promoted that year to colonel.

The caterpillar eats constantly, growing bigger in the process. 3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself, also known as the chrysalis or pupal stage. 4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa and undergoes metamorphosis within the cocoon. 5. After some time, the cocoon hatches, and an adult butterfly emerges. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis: the availability of food is reduced, and we must analyze the impact of this on the number of caterpillars that form cocoons and whether this perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process. While the perturbation hypothesis may have multiple outcomes, the most likely scenario is that it would lead to an overall decrease in the rate and number of caterpillars that form cocoons and subsequently transform into butterflies. This effect can result from several underlying factors: 1. Starvation: As caterpillars rely on a constant supply of food to grow and develop, reduced availability of food would increase the chance of starvation before they can even reach the stage where they form a cocoon. A higher number of caterpillars might perish before forming cocoons, leaving fewer to make the transition and continue the lifecycle. 2. Slower growth rate: With less food available, surviving caterpillars may not achieve the same rate of growth and development as they would in an environment with ample food. As a result, the time it takes for these caterpillars to reach the cocoon-forming stage could be prolonged. This delayed development might disrupt other aspects of the lifecycle, such as mating and reproduction patterns. 3. Smaller size and compromised health: Reduced food intake may cause surviving caterpillars to grow at a slower rate and reach smaller final body sizes. Smaller size and suboptimal food intake could negatively impact their overall health, and this compromised health might, in turn, affect their ability to form a cocoon and complete metamorphosis successfully. 4. Competition for food: With less food available, competition among caterpillars for resources becomes more intense. The caterpillars that are faster or better equipped to secure scarce food resources will have a better chance of surviving and forming cocoons, while others might not be as fortunate. The resulting selection pressure could lead to changes in the overall population dynamics and possibly even the evolution of specific traits or behaviors advantageous to those prevailing conditions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests less food availability may lead to fewer caterpillars forming cocoons seems plausible. Reduced food in the caterpillar stage might have direct effects, such as starvation, slower growth, and compromised health, leading to a decreased number of cocoons formed. Indirect effects can include intensified competition for food resources, which could impact the overall population dynamics and shape the evolution of the species."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Q: An electron in an atom is completely described by four of what? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: The Pauli Exclusion Principle An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml), but only if their spin quantum numbers ms have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values ⎛⎝± 1 ⎞⎠, no 2 more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons. The properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 6.1.

Review: A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season's \\"Homecoming\\" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered. The supposed \\"payoff\\" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial \\"cleaning\\" of the planet of it's human infestation, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" instead of having the male population butcher the females? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous.

President Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul hold a joint news conference Monday. \\"I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world,\\" Obama said at a joint news conference Monday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. \\"This is a country that has been often said lies at the crossroads between East and West. It's a country that possesses an extraordinarily rich heritage but also represents a blend of those ancient traditions with a modern nation state that respects democracy, respects rule of law and is striving toward a modern economy.\\" \\"My sense is they are moving forward quickly,\\" he said at an earlier press conference with","completion":"NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. \\"This is a great opportunity for both the United States and Turkey to build on that history of cooperation and to strengthen the relationship even further for the future.\\" Obama's visit to Turkey is an important one, not only to improve bilateral relations but also to recognize Turkey's significant role in the global context. As a secular democratic nation with a predominantly Muslim population, Turkey holds a unique position that allows it to play a bridging role between the West and the Islamic world. This is of particular relevance considering the increasingly complex challenges that have emerged in international politics and security concerns, including the fight against terrorism and the need for cultural and religious understanding. Additionally, Turkey's strategic location between Europe and Asia and its proximity to the Middle East make it an influential player in regional politics. It shares borders with countries like Syria, Iran, and Iraq, where the US has vested interests. In recent years, Ankara has sought to play a more active and assertive role in regional affairs, such as mediating between Israel and Syria, engaging with Iran in energy and security talks, and taking on a substantial responsibility in the NATO mission in Afghanistan. These aspects evidently make Turkey an essential partner for the US in both political and security-related matters. Primarily, the strategic partnership between the US and Turkey is of mutual benefit and based on shared values, such as democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. This partnership also underlines the necessity of closer collaboration in various areas, such as the promotion of democratic values and economic development in the region and addressing the emergent challenges, including the fight against terrorism. During his visit, Obama underscored the importance of Turkey's role as a mediator in the Middle East peace process. Given Turkey's historically good relations with both Israelis and Palestinians, it can provide valuable assistance in mediating between the parties and finding a solution to the long-lasting Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moreover, Turkey's engagement in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program demonstrates its commitment to finding a peaceful resolution to this issue. In the economic sphere, Turkey has been going through significant structural reforms and rapid change, transforming from a predominantly agrarian society to an industry-driven one. The country has shown considerable progress in macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline, experiencing an impressive average growth rate of 5% per year before the global economic crisis hit in 2008. This makes Turkey an attractive business partner and investment destination for American companies, which could contribute to boosting bilateral trade and investment. Furthermore, as a candidate for full European Union (EU) membership, Turkey plays a crucial role in its regional economic integration, which will eventually contribute to opening new markets for the U.S. and enhancing prosperity in Europe and the Middle East. In conclusion, President Obama's visit to Turkey aimed at sending a strong message highlighting the country's strategic importance to the United States and the world. Obama underlined the significance of improved collaboration in various areas, such as political, economic, and security domains, recognizing Turkey's unique position that enables it to promote understanding between the West and the Islamic world. Strengthening the relationship between the US and Turkey is crucial for addressing current global challenges and leveraging opportunities for mutual benefit in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - The University of Freiburg (colloquially ), officially the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, is a public research university located in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim?, using the article: During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

Question: Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Question: suppose during hot days happens, how will it affect magma is pushed with pressure to cool. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"During hot days, the temperature of the Earth's surface may increase slightly, but it has minimal to no effect on the process of magma being pushed to the surface and cooling. Geothermal forces and processes at work deep within the Earth are the primary drivers for volcanic activity, and they are orders of magnitude more powerful and influential than surface temperature variations. The process of volcano formation begins when gases, primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide, get trapped beneath the earth's crust. These gases create pressure that accumulates, and when the pressure reaches a critical point, molten magma rises to the Earth's surface, either through cracks or through volcanic conduits. Once the magma reaches the surface, it cools and starts to solidify, sometimes causing the formation of new land or islands when it cools in the Earth's ocean. Temperature differences on the Earth's surface due to hot days have minimal effect on the magma because of the vast temperature differences between the surface and the interior of the Earth. The average temperature of the Earth's crust is around 200 to 400 degrees Celsius (up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit), with the temperature increasing as we go deeper into the Earth. In comparison, magma temperatures can reach around 700 to 1300 degrees Celsius (1300 to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperature contrast between hot days and the Earth's interior is not significant enough to impact how magma is pushed to the surface or how it cools. Additionally, the formation and activity of a volcano are closely related to the movement of tectonic plates, which is not affected by surface temperatures. The upwelling of material from the Earth's mantle at divergent plate boundaries and subduction of one plate beneath another at convergent plate boundaries are key factors that stimulate volcanic processes. In conclusion, while hot days may slightly increase the Earth's surface temperature, they do not have a significant effect on the processes involved in the formation and activity of volcanos. The pressure buildup beneath the earth, movement of tectonic plates, and Earth's interior temperatures are all factors that play much more pivotal roles in the volcanic process. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: no effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

'Spider': John Coffey (pictured) was at head of a traveller family which avoided paying taxes and falsely claimed benefits totalling £600,000. Five members of a traveller family who avoided paying £500,000 in taxes and fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits were sentenced today. Husband and wife John and Brigid Coffey, and their children Michael, Mary and Helen were earning millions of pounds from two resurfacing and block paving businesses. While John and Michael Coffey deliberately laundered the money to avoid paying taxes, the female members of the family claimed thousands of pounds in benefits. This was despite the family owning valuable real estate and a number of expensive cars. John Coffey, 49, sat alongside Brigid, 51, Mary, 28, Helen 26, and Michael, 23, at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to 20 tax evasion and other fraud offences between 2001 and 2008. The court heard the family, who lived in South Wales and Gloucestershire, dealt mostly in cash, with John and Michael Coffey only declaring an income of £250 a week between them. During a police interview, John Coffey claimed their money came from block paving, horses and 'general wheeling and dealing'. Judge David Ticehurst jailed John Coffey, whose tax evasion amounted to £450,000, for two years and nine months and was told he must repay the amount in full within 28 days. Michael Coffey, who avoided paying £50,000 in tax, was handed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years. He was also told he would have to repay the money. 'It’s individuals like you that give the travelling community a bad name,' Judge Ticehurst said. 'Criminal conduct like yours brings your community into disrepute and reinforces prejudice. None of us like paying taxes, but society functions on the fact that people pay money to the revenue. 'These taxes are used to fund hospitals, schools, nurses and roads. You, however, choose not to pay tax and to falsely claim benefits of which you were not entitled. 'What is overwhelmingly clear in this case is that each one of you is dishonest. There can be no excuses for your behaviour.' Lavish: The Coffey family's property portfolio included Ton Y Pill farm, which has tall gates and CCTV cameras. Conning the public purse: John Coffey (pictured, left, outside Bristol Crown Court) and his son Michael Coffey (right) laundered money from their paving and resurfacing businesses to avoid paying £500,000 in taxes. The court heard Brigid Coffey claimed £39,789 in benefits, while Helen Coffey claimed £14,544.40 and Mary Coffey a sum of £53,893.44. Brigid Coffey was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work. Helen Coffey was handed a 12-month prison sentence also suspended for 18 months. She was told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Mary Coffey was given a suspended sentence of 12 months imprisonment and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Compensation. orders were made in the amounts claimed by Brigid and Helen Coffey. while Judge Ticehurst adjourned making an order against Mary Coffey for. further representations to be made. 'Dishonest': Michael Coffey, pictured carrying a large holdall, was given a suspended prison sentence. Opening the case, Don Tait, prosecuting, said: 'All of the defendants in this case are members of the travelling community, living predominantly in South Wales and Gloucestershire. 'It is the Crown’s case that the family as a whole operated for most of their life on the fringe of society.' The family, who owned two Mercedes, an. Audi and a Mitsubishi pick-up, were able to pass almost £2million. through their 35 bank accounts by using false names and documents. In. one fraudulent house transfer, John Coffey hired two sets of solicitors. and acted the roles of both seller and purchaser simultaneously in. order to transfer property around the family in different names - making. it unclear who owned what. A. number of properties, including two farms in Peterstone Wentlooge,. Cardiff, a £500,000 house in West Drayton, Middlesex, and two houses in. Rumney, Cardiff, were registered to the family. Spared jail: Wife Brigid Coffey, who tried to conceal her identity (right) was given an 12-month suspended prison sentence for falsely claiming nearly £40,000 in benefits. They lived in Ton Y Pill Farm - a walled property, which boasted high gates and CCTV cameras. But the court heard it was not clear where the funds to buy the properties came from. The family also owned and used two plots at the Mount View Caravan Site in Naas Lane, Brookthorpe, near Gloucester. The properties were mostly paid for by cash or banker’s draft with no mortgages. The family ran two companies, B&B Welsh Paving and Sunset Drives and Landscapes Ltd, which provided driveway resurfacing services. Walked free: Helen Coffey (left) and her sister Mary (right) were given 12-month suspended prison sentences after fraudulently claiming £14,544.40 and £53,893.44 respectively. The latter was set up in 2006 as a front to deliberately conceal the extent of their business revenues, Mr Tait said. But investigations into the family’s bank accounts showed a vast turnover of money. 'The. family appeared to be awash with cash, invested in real estate and. vehicles, yet the female family members were claiming benefits using. subterfuge and non-declaration, said Mr Tait. The. family looked to invest in Spanish properties in the Costa del Sol and. Riviera del Sol, although they never completed on any of their plans to. buy. John Coffey was described by the judge as the 'spider' at the centre of a web of deceit. The court was told his son was just 12 years old when the family fraud began and 17 when he was first arrested in 2007. Addressing. the judge, Raymond Tully, defending Michael Coffey, said: 'It goes. almost without saying you are sentencing a son for crimes committed. together with his father at a time when he was of very tender years.' While the men avoided paying tax, the family women fraudulently claimed £100,000 in benefits. Unwelcome publicity: Helen Coffey, 26, makes an offensive gesture as she hides her face from photographers. The three women told authorities they had no savings or assets and claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit and money from a Social Fund Budgeting Loan. They used a variety of names and stories, on occasion claiming to be single parents who needed the money to buy clothing and footwear. Prithvijit Hoon, defending Brigid Coffey, said: 'One of the ethos of the travel community is the status of the wife being deferential towards her husband.' Christopher Quinlan, mitigating for John Coffey, said: 'Mr Coffey was running a business in respect to which work was done and money was paid. He did not declare that income in terms of tax. 'Mr Coffey is an industrious, hard-working man and the Revenue have got their money through his hard work.' The court heard £500,000 has already been restrained from the family’s bank accounts and is now subject to confiscation proceedings. In 2010 John Coffey and Michael Coffey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently taking steps to divert money from HM Treasury or to deprive HM Treasury of money to which it was entitled. John Coffey also admitted two counts of knowingly using a false Irish driving licence. Facing justice: Mary Coffey (left) and Brigid Coffey (centre) outside Bristol Crown Court, where they were sentenced. Brigid Coffey pleaded guilty to five counts of making a false statement to obtain benefits, while mother-of-five Mary Coffey pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements. Helen Coffey, a mother of one, pleaded guilty in respect of an ongoing claim for income support, failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of her bank accounts with positive balances, and the fact that she was married. She also admitted making a false statement to obtain a Social Fund Budgeting Loan and two counts of providing the false name Helen Delaney to Cardiff Magistrates’ Court in October 2005 and April 2006. Officers from five police forces, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions worked together to bring the Coffeys to justice. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock, who led the investigation for Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The sentencing of the Coffey family marks the culmination of many years of work by literally hundreds of officers and officials. Covered up: Defendants John Coffey (left) and Helen Coffey (right) tried to hide their faces outside court. 'This family had been engaging in questionable financial and business activities for many years, until we collectively caught up with them.' Simon De Kayne, assistant director of criminal investigation, HM Revenue and Customs, said: 'The Coffeys blatantly evaded UK tax laws to selfishly steal around £500,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund their criminally gained lifestyles and expanding property portfolio. 'The sentencing shows HMRC, along with our partner agencies, will not only pursue and prosecute tax fraudsters but also seek to reclaim the proceeds of their crimes.' Andrew Biker, of CPS central fraud division, said: 'No income was ever declared by John Coffey to the Inland Revenue despite him working all his life in the tarmac and block paving industries. 'Even more money was made buying and selling cars and trading horses. 'The sheer number of bank accounts operated by the family and their ability to transfer significant funds between them fly in the face of their claims of illiteracy and ignorance of matters such as income tax. 'No matter how you earn money, paying tax matters. But denying the honest British public of their contribution to tax was not enough for the Coffeys who went further by setting out to take funds set aside for those who most need them. 'People can rest assured that the CPS will do all it can to deprive these criminals of their assets and put the money back where it belongs - into the public purse.'

Please add spaces between words: JeremiahwassetoverbothJudahandIsrael.","completion":"Jeremiah was set over both Judah and Israel. This sentence, when spaced correctly, reads as: \\"Jeremiah was set over both Judah and Israel.\\" The sentence refers to the prophet Jeremiah in the context of the ancient biblical kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Jeremiah, a major prophet in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, is known for his prophecies, warnings, and vision for the future of these two kingdoms. According to the Bible, his calling to be a prophet and his divine appointment was to communicate the will of God to both the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. The context in which this sentence is likely used discusses the biblical history of Judah and Israel. These two kingdoms have a rich history, deeply intertwined with the stories of other biblical figures. In the Bible, Israel was the larger and more prosperous of the two kingdoms. However, it was frequently affected by civil unrest and was eventually conquered by the Assyrians in circa 722 BCE. Judah, on the other hand, was smaller and less prosperous but had a more stable political history. It survived until the Babylonian invasion in circa 586 BCE, which led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of many of its inhabitants. During his time as a prophet, Jeremiah faced significant opposition and persecution for his bold messages and challenging outlook. He warned of the impending judgment from God and urged both Judah and Israel to repent and return to a covenantal relationship with their Creator. Often called the \\"weeping prophet,\\" Jeremiah was noted for his strong empathy and sorrow over the foreseeable consequences of his people's disobedience. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Jeremiah was set over both Judah and Israel\\" highlights the important role that the prophet Jeremiah played in the spiritual lives of these two kingdoms.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great!

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century? Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

Premise: \\"Today some nationalists still yearn for good old Borinquen, a name you'll see on many restaurants and bars.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Borinquen was the best period for the country.\\" true?","completion":"Well, sweetie, this is a little tricky. When we say \\"Borinquen\\", it's often referring to what is now called Puerto Rico, before it was discovered by Europeans. It's like the old name for that place. Just like your Grandma's house is still the same house, even if we start calling it \\"Grandma's palace\\", okay? Now, when we see \\"Borinquen\\" written on restaurants or bars, it's often because people who love Puerto Rico are remembering what it was like long, long ago. Think of it like if you've moved houses, and then put a picture of your old house on your bedroom wall because you still love and remember it. But, darling, it's very important to understand that just because some people remember Borinquen fondly doesn't mean it was the \\"best\\" time for everyone. People can have different ideas about what's 'best'. It's a bit like how you love playtime because you can play with your toys, but your sister might like lunchtime best because she loves her sandwiches.

Does that make sense, sweetie?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight? It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress. Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.","completion":"Based on the given information, the white coat would absorb less sunlight compared to the black coat. In the context of the provided paragraph, it is explained that light can transfer its energy to matter through absorption, which in turn increases the temperature of the matter. Dark colors, such as black, are known to absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. This absorption occurs because dark surfaces have less capability to reflect light and tend to absorb more wavelengths of the incident light. On the other hand, light colors, such as white, have a higher capacity to reflect sunlight, and therefore, they absorb less light energy. As a result, wearing a white coat will lead to absorbing less sunlight and staying relatively cooler compared to wearing a black coat. This concept is evidenced by Sarah's decision-making process on choosing a dress for a hot and sunny day for a family picnic in the park. She might prefer wearing a white dress, as it absorbs less sunlight and helps her stay cooler during the day. In conclusion, the white coat would absorb less sunlight due to its higher capacity to reflect light when compared to a black coat. This is important to consider in various situations, such as dressing for an outdoor event on a sunny day, as it can significantly impact one's comfort level in terms of temperature regulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity. In the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would the y-axis be higher or lower than Atlantic Ocean's acidity test Hint: To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The y-axis for the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would be lower than the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Rob, a climate scientist, is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. 2. Rob uses an acid-base titration to measure the acidity, where a strong base solution (NaOH or KOH) is added to neutralize the acid solution. The titration curve has two axes - base volume on the x-axis and the pH value on the y-axis. 3. The pH value is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a solution. A lower pH value indicates a higher acidity level, while a higher pH value indicates a lower acidity level. 4. According to Rob's conclusion, the Atlantic Ocean's acidity has reached a higher level than the Pacific Ocean's acidity. 5. Since the Atlantic Ocean has higher acidity, its pH value on the y-axis would be lower than the Pacific Ocean's pH value. 6. Therefore, the y-axis for the Pacific Ocean's acidity test would be higher (with a higher pH value, indicating lower acidity) than the Atlantic Ocean's acidity test (with a lower pH value, indicating higher acidity)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(CNN) -- They've been man's best friend since the beginning of time. And now, thanks to modern technology, two best friends are together again. When Giuseppe DiBella's beloved 6-month-old puppy Nika disappeared from his home in Newburgh, New York, he immediately plastered countless fliers around town showing pictures of Nika as well as the toy fox terrier's microchip number. But no luck ... time ticked on, and two years passed. While DiBella may have been devastated, he says he \\"never gave up.\\" In mid-September, the 3-pound pooch showed up at the front door of a home in Ocala, Florida, more than 1,000 miles away. When CNN asked how his little pup could've made her way from","completion":"New York to Florida, DiBella couldn't help but express his amazement and wonder. \\"It's truly a miracle. I always had a small glimmer of hope, but to see Nika show up all the way in Florida is beyond belief,\\" he said. Nika's journey from Newburgh to Ocala seems like something out of a movie. After the initial shock and heartbreak, DiBella started to piece together what might have happened to his missing companion. It's believed that Nika may have been accidentally picked up by travelers passing through New York, likely attracted to the friendly and playful puppy. Over the course of two years, the people who had taken Nika in somehow lost track of her, and she ended up alone in Florida. Meanwhile, back in Newburgh, DiBella maintained his diligence in searching for his lost friend. He regularly updated the fliers around town and continued to check local animal shelters and online databases for any sign of Nika. By doing so, he had unknowingly created a network of support that would eventually lead to their reunion. The key to this unbelievable story lies in Nika's microchip. When the family in Ocala found the lost dog at their doorstep, they took the little pup straight to their nearest vet clinic. The veterinarian scanned Nika's microchip and immediately found her identification number, which led them to connect with DiBella. Unable to contain his joy, DiBella booked a flight as soon as possible to reunite with his long-lost companion. Microchipping plays a vital role in the reunification of lost pets with their owners. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), lost pets with microchips are 2.5 times more likely to be reunited with their families. It's an unfortunate fact that only around 22% of lost dogs who enter animal shelters are reunited with their owners. However, this number rises to a remarkable 52% when the lost dog has been microchipped. In light of Nika's safe return, DiBella has become an advocate for microchipping and encourages other pet owners to do the same. \\"It's a small investment that can make a world of difference,\\" he says. \\"I could have lost Nika forever had it not been for the microchip. If sharing my story can help other pet owners understand the importance of microchipping and potentially prevent them from experiencing the heartache I went through, then it's worth it.\\" Nika's story of love, heartbreak, and eventual reunion is a testament to the profound bond between humans and their pets. It acts as a reminder never to give up on hope, no matter how much time passes or how far apart we are from our loved ones. This incredible tale of a dog's journey spanning over 1,000 miles only further cements the idea that the bond between a person and their pet can conquer even the most insurmountable odds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ratatouille Context: Remy is an idealistic and ambitious young rat, gifted with highly developed senses of taste and smell. Inspired by his idol, the recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau, Remy dreams of becoming a cook himself. When an old French woman discovers Remy's clan in her house, they are forced to flee, and Remy becomes separated from his family in the panic. He ends up in the sewers of Paris and eventually finds himself at a skylight overlooking the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant. As Remy watches, a young man named Alfredo Linguini is hired as a garbage boy by Skinner, the restaurant's devious current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy, but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. Colette Tatou, the staff's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence, and decides to keep him instead. Remy discovers that he can control Linguini's movements by pulling his hair. On Linguini's first day as a chef, he and Remy find a way to communicate: Remy guides Linguini like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hidden under Linguini's toque, while Skinner assigns Colette to train his new cook. Suspicious, Skinner learns that the boy is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and the lucrative packaged food enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death.

Does \\"President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.\\" correctly answer the question of When was this deciding battle fought?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794\\" correctly answers the question of when the deciding battle was fought. The Battle of Fallen Timbers took place in 1794 and was a decisive and crucial conflict between the United States and the Indian confederacy. To add context and detail to this answer, the Battle of Fallen Timbers was part of the Northwest Indian War, fought from 1785 to 1795, which happened in the region that would become the Northwestern United States. The Indian confederacy consisted of various Native American tribes, such as the Shawnee, Delaware, Ottawa, and Anishinaabeg, who were supported by the British Empire. Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War, tensions arose between Native Americans and the newly-formed United States. The Northwest Territory, which included present-day Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, was viewed as crucial for American expansion. Conflicts between Native American tribes and American settlers grew, resulting in the Northwest Indian War. U.S. forces experienced initial setbacks and defeats in this conflict, notably in 1791, with the most significant one being the defeat of Major General Arthur St. Clair's troops by Native American forces led by Little Turtle and Blue Jacket. As a result, President George Washington decided to reorganize and train a new American army under General Anthony Wayne. Washington's decision paid off in 1794 when, on August 20, General Wayne led his forces against the Indian confederacy in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The battle took place near present-day Maumee, Ohio, close to the site where fallen trees had been uprooted by a recent tornado. The skilled and disciplined American forces outmatched the confederated tribes, highlighting a stark contrast to the previous defeats. Wayne's victory in the Battle of Fallen Timbers significantly weakened the Indian confederacy and marked a turning point in the war. Ultimately, this decisive win paved the way for the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, which established peace between the United States and the Native American confederacy. It also opened up the Northwest Territory for further American expansion, enabling the country to grow and prosper. In conclusion, the statement provided answeres the question correctly, as the deciding battle, the Battle of Fallen Timbers, was fought in 1794. This battle marked a turning point in the Northwest Indian War, ultimately leading to the Treaty of Greenville and establishing peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Figure 1.3: Family Net Worth by Income Level in 1998 3. Figure 1.4: Share of Elderly Households' Income by Source of The premise provides three pieces of information that all pertain to wealth distribution within the country: 1. Wealth-Income Ratio (1960-2000) 28: This information conveys the relationship between wealth (net worth) and income over four decades (1960 to 2000), providing an understanding of how wealth and income have varied. This ratio can give us insights into inequality levels within the country - a higher ratio may indicate the concentration of wealth among the wealthy, while a more equal distribution may lead to a lower ratio. 2. Figure 1.3: Family Net Worth by Income Level in 1998: This figure will presumably show the distribution of family net worth across different income levels in 1998. Family net worth is an essential aspect of a country's wealth distribution, as it indicates families' financial statuses by considering their assets and liabilities. By observing how family net worth changes across income levels, one can gain insights into the inequality present within the country concerning households' financial situations. 3. Figure 1.4: Share of Elderly Households' Income by Source of: The final piece of information refers to the breakdown of income sources for elderly households. This information helps to determine wealth distribution for a specific demographic - the elderly. By understanding the sources of their income (e.g., pensions, investments, social security, etc.), it provides a more detailed view of wealth distribution within the country and highlights any potential gaps or inadequacies in the support systems for this particular population. So, considering the information presented in the premise, it aligns with the hypothesis that the figures show the wealth distribution of the country. The data points provided all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of wealth and income across different time periods, income levels, and for a specific demographic group (the elderly)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Relatives of a 17-year-old are angry the teenager was shot and killed by a homeowner who police say was protecting her property. The sister of the teen who died identified him as Trevon Johnson. She said he was a student at D. A. Dorsey Technical College. “I don’t care if she have her gun license or any of that. That is way beyond the law… way beyond,” said Johnson’s cousin Nautika Harris. “He was not supposed to die like this. He had a future ahead of him. Trevon had goals… he was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning.” On Thursday, police say Johnson burglarized a home south of 79th Street near I-95 — just blocks away from where he lives. The 54-year-old woman told police her surveillance system alerted her to the break-in of her home. She said she rushed home and found the teen climbing out of a window. “She observed a subject leaving the home through the rear,” said police Det. Dan Ferrin. Miami-Dade police said there was a confrontation and shots were fired. Police said they were on scene seconds after the shooting and gave CPR to the teen. Johnson was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. “What’s wrong with her,” asked Johnson’s sister Nisha Johnson. “She did not have to shoot him.” “It’s no reason she should have waited until I think he walked out the yard to try to shoot him,” said Harris. “If she called the police already why would she shoot him?” Relatives said they don’t believe Johnson stole anything from the home but detectives would not confirm that. “You have to look at it from every child’s point of view that was raised in the hood,” said Harris. “You have to understand… how he gonna get his money to have clothes to go to school? You have to look at it from his point-of-view.” Police said the homeowner is cooperating with detectives and was taken to a police station for questioning. “She’s a person that is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in,” Ferrin said. Investigators said they’re still trying to sort all of this out and want the public to remember that, if possible, it’s best not to take these types of situations into your own hands. “If there’s any type of situation that happens or they believe there’s a burglary at the home or any type of confrontation, dial 911. Have the police make that confrontation,” Ferrin said. “That’s what we’re here for.” The case has been handed over to state attorney’s office but, so far, no charges have been filed against her. ||||| NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE, Fla. (WSVN) -- A teenage boy who was allegedly caught burglarizing a Northwest Miami-Dade home died Thursday night after, police said, he was shot during a confrontation with the homeowner. Police have released 17-year-old Trevon Johnson's name and mug shot Friday afternoon. The mug shot provided was taken from a prior arrest earlier this year. According to Miami-Dade Police, at around 5:30 p.m., the 54-year-old homeowner was alerted of the attempted burglary from an alarm system at her residence, located near Northwest 72nd Street and 19th Avenue. \\"We received a call, possibly of her alarm going off,\\" said Miami-Dade Detective Dan Ferrin. \\"As she was en route to the home, the police was called out as well.\\" The homeowner said when she arrived at her home, she saw Johnson attempting to break in. Investigators said the homeowner pulled up to her home and went room to room. Police said the altercation ended with at least one gunshot and the suspect bleeding on the ground. \\"At that point, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue responded to the scene and transported the victim to [Ryder] Trauma, where he later was pronounced deceased,\\" said Ferrin. Back at the scene of the break-in, crime scene detectives and homicide investigators spent hours picking up every piece of evidence they could find. Police said the homeowner has been cooperative throughout the investigation. Officials worked through the night and into the morning on this case and checking out her story. As of Friday afternoon, officials have confirmed that her story checks out. Ferrin said the most significant details of the investigation may come from the woman who, police said, pulled the trigger. \\"She's very cooperative, she's been talking to our detectives, she's gathering all the information,\\" he said. \\"You have to remember, she's 54 years of age, OK? She's a person that obviously is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in.\\" Meanwhile, at Jackson Memorial Hospital, 7News cameras captured Miami-Dade Police officers speaking with a doctor who then comforted the family of the deceased teen. Detectives are attempting to determine whether there is surveillance video of the incident, as well as how many shots were fired during the confrontation. Ultimately, they said, it will be up to the State Attorney's Office to decide if charges will be filed against the homeowner.

She lives in Liberty City, a high-crime neighborhood in a high-crime town. Her low-slung duplex backs onto the railroad tracks and has been targeted in the past. She can also be forgiven for racing home when, on Thursday afternoon, her security system alerted her to another break-in at the property. But can she be forgiven for, according to police, fatally shooting a teenager as he fled her house, even as officers were on their way to help? That is the question now facing the state’s attorney’s office. Seventeen-year-old Trevon Johnson died Thursday night after Jenrette shot him once as he allegedly fled the scene of the home invasion, according to Miami-Dade police. There have been no indications that Johnson was armed. The slaying of the teenage burglary suspect was reported triumphantly by local television station WSVN, which said Jenrette had “turned the tables” on Johnson. “Police say this would-be robber chose the wrong home because this homeowner did more than just call the cops,” reported WSVN’s Brandon Beyer. “She had a gun.” But Johnson’s family said the young man didn’t deserve to die over mere property, which they said he hadn’t even taken. “I don’t care if she have her gun license, her rights or any of that. That is way beyond the law,” Johnson’s cousin Nautika Harris told CBS Miami. “Way beyond.” The law on home invasions and use of force, however, varies widely from one state to the next. Similar cases across the United States have produced starkly different outcomes, with some homeowners who shot intruders charged with manslaughter or even murder. The Miami shooting comes at a crucial moment in the debate over gun control in this country. In January, President Obama announced new executive orders to combat gun violence, angering gun rights advocates. And amid an incessant string of mass shootings, states continue to expand their open-carry regulations. As violent crime edged up last year for the first time in decades, America appears divided over whether increased gun ownership is part of the problem or the solution. [Concealed-weapon owner shoots hatchet-wielding attacker in Wash. 7-Eleven] Over the past two years, a handful of U.S. homeowners have been charged for fatally shooting intruders. In 2013, James George Stiffler fatally shot a man he found allegedly ransacking his Helena, Mont., home. The homeowner, then 66, said he feared his wife was in the house and that the intruder, 37-year-old Henry Thomas Johnson, was dangerous. At first, authorities sided with Stiffler. But then the medical examiner determined that Johnson had been shot in the back. “I believed Stiffler was not at fault,” Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton told the Billings Gazette. “But forensic evidence indicates a different event.” Prosecutors charged Stiffler with murder in 2015. His attorneys slammed the charges. “Mr. Stiffler has mourned the loss of life, even as he was left with no choice but to fire his weapon,” Stiffler’s attorneys said in a statement. “But it is a travesty of justice that Johnson’s conduct also now threatens to ruin Mr. Stiffler’s life as well.” Last month, a jury failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial, according to the Missoulian. In another recent case, an Akron, Ohio, man was indicted in October for fatally shooting a home invader. David Hillis, 21, was charged with voluntary manslaughter, a first-degree felony, according to Cleveland.com. He pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial for the Aug. 7, 2015, slaying of Marcus Glover. When Glover and another man tried to rob Hillis, he grabbed a gun and chased them outside, firing several shots after them, according to police. Glover was found dead two houses away. Akron prosecutors said that by chasing the intruders, Hillis was no longer protected by Ohio’s Castle Doctrine law, which allows homeowners to use lethal force, according to Cleveland.com. In many more cases, though, homeowners have not been charged with a crime after killing suspected burglars. Perhaps the most famous recent case occurred in July 2014, when 80-year-old Long Beach, Calif., homeowner Thomas Greer fatally shot a female intruder even after she begged for her life and claimed she was pregnant. According to prosecutors, the woman, 28-year-old Andrea Miller, and a male accomplice had robbed Greer at least once before. When they returned on July 22, 2014, Greer grabbed his gun, chased them outside and shot Miller in the back. “Don’t shoot me, I’m pregnant! I’m going to have a baby!” Miller claimed, falsely, before Greer shot her once more. “He meted out his own punishment,” wrote syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette. “Was that because Greer was angry and frustrated at being victimized and wanted retribution? If so, that’s not a good excuse for taking a life.” In January 2015, prosecutors announced they would not file charges against Greer, according to the Los Angeles Times. A missing child alert for Johnson from November. Charges are even less likely in Thursday’s shooting in Miami. Johnson’s family made an impassioned claim that the teenager deserved justice, despite the circumstances of his death. “He was not supposed to die like this,” Harris, his cousin, told CBS. “He had a future ahead of him. Trevon had goals. He was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning.” Johnson was a student at D.A. Dorsey Technical College, barely a block away from where he died. He also lived in the same neighborhood, and his cousin said Liberty City shared some blame in his death. “You have to look at it from every child’s point of view that was raised in the hood,” Harris said. “You have to understand … how he gonna get his money to have clothes to go to school? You have to look at it from his point-of-view.” She and other family members said that Jenrette did not need to shoot Johnson, especially since police were on their way. “If she called the police already, why would she shoot him?” Harris told CBS. There is little clarity in the reports of what happened that afternoon after Jenrette rushed home. It’s unclear whether Jenrette called the police or whether they were automatically called to the house by the alarm system. A police statement said she “arrived prior to the officers and began to inspect the exterior of the home, when a confrontation occurred with the burglar. The homeowner produced a firearm and shot the subject.” Other news reports quoting police said she “went room to room” searching the house before finding Johnson, according to WSVN. “She observed a subject exiting the home through the rear,” Miami-Dade police spokesman Daniel Ferrin told the television station. “At that point there was some type of a quick confrontation.” “The police told her don’t go in the house,” Vaughan Johnson, Trevon’s brother, told WPLG. “She’s still going in the house searching for something. Then she says this lady came out and shot one time and shot him in the chest.” “What’s wrong with her?” Johnson’s sister, Nisha Johnson, told CBS. “She did not have to shoot him.” Police arrived moments after the shooting and tried to revive Trevon, but it was too late. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Johnson had been arrested earlier this year, although the charge was not disclosed because he was a juvenile, WSVN reported. The state’s attorney’s office will decide whether charges will be filed against Jenrette. But Florida statutes provide some of the staunchest protections in the country for homeowners who confront intruders. “A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony,” according to state law. “A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.” But Florida law goes far beyond this “Stand Your Ground” law, which became the focal point in the 2012 shooting of another 17-year-old, Trayvon Martin, in Sanford, Fla. Instead, in Florida, anybody who “unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter a person’s dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle is presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.” That means that homeowners are presumed to have “reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another” whenever someone “unlawfully and forcefully” enters their house, essentially giving homeowners broad license to shoot at intruders. Florida law also provides homeowners who shoot intruders with sweeping protections against civil lawsuits, meaning Johnson’s family is unlikely to receive a wrongful death settlement. Police said Jenrette is cooperating with the investigation and accompanied officers to the station for questioning. “She’s a person that is a little distraught because this is her home that someone obviously was in,” Ferrin told CBS. He also asked citizens to let officers do their jobs, however. “If there’s any type of situation that happens or they believe there’s a burglary at the home or any type of confrontation, dial 911. Have the police make that confrontation,” he said. “That’s what we’re here for.” Read more: ‘Worst nightmare’: Woman with concealed gun permit shoots at fleeing shoplifter outside Home Depot Mich. woman who shot at shoplifters gets 18 months probation, vows to ‘never help anybody again’ Concealed gun permit holder fatally shoots suspected robber during Chicago stickup ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Relatives of an African-American teenager shot dead in Miami by a homeowner while allegedly burglarizing their house are angry the homeowner has not been charged with murder.

The Dodge Durango was traveling north on I-95 near Titusville around 6:30pm when it apparently suffered what Florida Highway Patrol officials say was a tire malfunction, leading the driver to lose control and the car to flip a few times, WESH reports. Four passengers were ejected, including a toddler in a car seat. The driver, identified by the FHP as 34-year Latorya Brown, was wearing a seatbelt and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, cops tell Florida Today. The three people who died were all said to be girls under the age of 18, per the FHP, while the toddler, who was lofted over what various sources say was a 25- to 30-foot-high barrier wall, was found in the nearby yard of an unoccupied home. \\"When they arrived on scene, officers, troopers, and deputies heard the crying and found the child on the other side of the wall,\\" FHP spokesman Steve Montiero says. The child was brought to a local hospital and is in stable condition. Meanwhile, officials are trying to figure out why so many people were in a car that didn't have enough seatbelts for everyone. \\"We're talking 11 people inside of an SUV,\\" Montiero says, per News 6. \\"I don't know any SUV that fits 11 people inside of it.\\" He adds, per Florida Today, \\"Obviously someone was not belted. We're going to begin to look into that and determine what kind of charges will go from there.\\" (A fiery Memorial Day crash in California in 2013 left five teens dead.)

While they were driving, something went wrong with one of the car's tires. This made it really hard for the person driving the car to control it. The car flipped over a few times and some passengers fell out of the car. Sadly, three young girls lost their lives in this accident. Other people in the car got hurt, but the driver, who was wearing a special thing called a seatbelt, was not badly injured. There was even a very small child in the car, who was thrown out of it. Thankfully, the little child didn't get badly hurt and was taken to a special place called a hospital. The people who make sure everyone follows the rules on the roads, called the Florida Highway Patrol, are now trying to find out why there were so many people in the car when there weren't enough seatbelts for everyone.

Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe then spent part of nearly every year working in New Mexico. She collected rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: \\"Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again.\\" Due to exhaustion and poor health, she did not work from late 1932 until about the mid-1930s. She was a popular and reputed artist. She received a number of commissions and her works were exhibited in New York and other places. In 1936, she completed what would become one of her most well-known paintings, Summer Days, in 1936. It depicted a desert scene with a deer skull with vibrant wildflowers. Resembling Ram's Head with Hollyhock, it depicted the skull floating above the horizon. In 1938, the advertising agency N. W. Ayer & Son approached O'Keeffe about creating two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company) to use in their advertising. Other artists who produced paintings of Hawaii for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company's advertising include Lloyd Sexton, Jr., Millard Sheets, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Isamu Noguchi, and Miguel Covarrubias. The offer came at a critical time in O'Keeffe's life: she was 51, and her career seemed to be stalling (critics were calling her focus on New Mexico limited, and branding her desert images \\"a kind of mass production\\"). She arrived in Honolulu February 8, 1939 aboard the SS Lurline, and spent nine weeks in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the island of Hawaii. By far the most productive and vivid period was on Maui, where she was given complete freedom to explore and paint. She painted flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks. Back in New York, O'Keeffe completed a series of 20 sensual, verdant paintings. However, she did not paint the requested pineapple until the Hawaiian Pineapple Company sent a plant to her New York studio. During the 1940s O'Keeffe had two one-woman retrospectives, the first at the Art Institute of Chicago (1943). Her second was in 1946, when she was the first woman artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan. Whitney Museum of American Art began an effort to create the first catalogue of her work in the mid-1940s. In the 1940s, O'Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the \\"Black Place\\", about 150 miles west of her Ghost Ranch house. O'Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled \\"a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet.\\" She made paintings of the \\"White Place\\", a white rock formation located near her Abiquiu house.","completion":"This text is about the renowned American painter Georgia O'Keeffe. Born on November 15, 1887, in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, O'Keeffe was the daughter of dairy farmers Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe. She was named after her maternal grandfather, George Victor Totto, a Hungarian count who immigrated to the United States in 1848. O'Keeffe is well-known for her close association with the landscape of New Mexico, where she spent significant amounts of time working and capturing the distinct natural beauty, architecture, and geological forms of the region. She had a deep connection with the places she painted, including Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, and drew inspiration from the rocks and bones she collected from the desert floor. Although O'Keeffe faced periods of exhaustion, poor health, and wavering career success, she persevered, earning recognition and commissions for her work. She created numerous iconic paintings, such as 1936's Summer Days, that featured deer skulls, vibrant wildflowers, and desert scenes. In 1938, she accepted a commission from advertising agency N.W. Ayer & Son to create two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, which led her to spend nine weeks in Hawaii producing a series of lush, tropical paintings. O'Keeffe broke barriers as a female artist, becoming the first woman to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan in 1946. Throughout the 1940s, she continued to explore various landscapes in her work, painting the \\"Black Place\\" and \\"White Place\\" near her New Mexico homes. O'Keeffe's legendary career serves as an inspiration to artists worldwide, and her art remains a testament to her talent and dedication to her craft."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To make a dustpan when you don't have one readily available, you can choose from a few methods using materials commonly found at home. I will discuss some methods and compare their effectiveness to help you decide which one makes the most sense. Method 1: Cardboard dustpan You can create a makeshift dustpan using a piece of cardboard. To craft a cardboard dustpan: 1. Find a piece of cardboard (a cereal box or any thin cardboard packaging would do). 2. Using a pair of scissors or a box cutter, cut a rectangle of approximately 10 inches by 12 inches. 3. Fold the cardboard in half lengthwise, creating a crease down the middle. 4. Then, fold the bottom third back towards the crease, making sure the edges align. This creates the surface that will scoop the dust. 5. Tape the folded edges tightly to make a durable dustpan. Cardboard dustpan pros: - Easy to make from readily available materials - Lightweight - Biodegradable Cardboard dustpan cons: - Not very durable and may not hold up against heavy-duty cleaning tasks - Can become ineffective when wet Method 2: Plastic bottle dustpan Another option is to create a dustpan by re-using an empty plastic bottle. Here's how to create a plastic bottle dustpan: 1. Take a plastic bottle with a flat bottom (a 2-liter bottle works best). 2. Remove the label and clean the bottle thoroughly. 3. Using a pair of scissors, cut off the top part of the bottle, leaving only the bottom half. 4. Cut a vertical line straight up from the bottle's bottom to its middle. 5. Start cutting along the edge of the bottle's bottom to create a flat surface on one side. 6. Trim the edges to ensure smoothness and stability for your dustpan. Plastic bottle dustpan pros: - More durable than a cardboard dustpan - Can be used for wet and dry cleaning tasks - Provides a practical way to upcycle plastic waste Plastic bottle dustpan cons: - May require a little more cutting and trimming compared to cardboard dustpan - Could be less environmentally friendly if not properly disposed of In comparing these two methods, the cardboard dustpan might be ideal if you have limited resources on hand, and you need a quick, temporary solution. However, the plastic bottle dustpan offers better durability, is suitable for both wet and dry cleaning tasks, and helps upcycle an otherwise discarded item. In conclusion, considering the durability and versatility, the plastic bottle dustpan makes more sense to accomplish the goal of creating a dustpan when you don't have one readily available. However, it is crucial to ensure that you properly dispose of the plastic dustpan later to minimize environmental impact. The cardboard dustpan can still be a preferable solution in cases where you need a quick and biodegradable option."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: An astronaut's work may sound exciting, but living in space isn't as fun as you think. The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Question: What's the hardest part of life for astronauts in space? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The hardest part of life for astronauts in space can vary depending on individual preferences and experiences. However, based on the information provided in the article, it appears that the feeling of loneliness might be considered the most challenging aspect of living in space. Astronauts often have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth, separated from their friends and families, which can lead to feelings of isolation and emotional distress. Additionally, there are various physical and practical challenges that astronauts have to face while living in space. These include wearing tight gloves during spacewalks that can hurt their fingernails and cause them to fall off, limited food choices with a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, the inability to eat bread due to the risk of crumbs flying around and damaging equipment, and difficulties in maintaining personal hygiene with no access to a proper shower. Moreover, astronauts also suffer from a reduction in bone strength during their stay in space, for which no solution has been found yet. They try to counteract this by exercising while in space to keep their bones strong as long as possible. In conclusion, the hardest part of life for astronauts in space could be the feeling of loneliness resulting from the long-duration stays away from Earth and their loved ones.

The answer to the question: Where was Moore when he took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool? is inside the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?","completion":"Moore took timed-sketching classes and saw a cast of the Chac Mool during his stay in London while studying at the Royal College of Art.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in a linguistic context refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (let's call it Sentence A) guarantees the truth of another sentence (Sentence B). If Sentence A is true, then Sentence B must also be true for it to be considered entailment. In the context of the two provided sentences, the relationship between them contradicts, not entailment. The first sentence, \\"But the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter disaster\\" suggests that the Cabinet was aware of how narrowly they avoided disaster. It proves that they had knowledge of how close they came to experiencing a disastrously adverse event. On the contrary, the second sentence, \\"The Cabinet had no idea how close they were to disaster\\", suggests that the Cabinet was unaware of their proximity to disaster. It suggests that they were oblivious to the potential calamity they narrowly avoided. Therefore, the two statements cannot both be true simultaneously. If the Cabinet knew how narrowly they escaped disaster, they could not simultaneously have no idea how close they were to disaster. Thus, the second sentence is not entailed by the first.

News article: Israel accused Iran of responsibility for twin bombing attempts aimed at Israeli embassy personnel in New Delhi and Tbilisi, Georgia, on Monday, fueling a growing confrontation over Iran’s nuclear program. The rare coordinated attempts on the lives of Israeli diplomatic representatives came a month after the latest assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist and were set against an escalating war of words between Israel and Iran over a possible Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. The attempted attacks also coincided with the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, a leader of Hezbollah, a militant Shiite Lebanese group backed by Iran. Tehran has vowed revenge for the killing of its scientists, which it has blamed on Israel, and Hezbollah has vowed to avenge the slaying of its leader, considered a mastermind of some of the group’s deadliest attacks. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the incidents, but Israeli officials said they appeared to have been directed by Iran, and they warned that if the Islamic republic becomes a nuclear power, it could provide greater protection for militant groups that would be emboldened by its support. Iran denied responsibility for the bombing attempts, calling them an Israeli provocation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited places where he said attacks on Israelis and Jews had recently been foiled, including Thailand and Azerbaijan, and he accused Tehran of orchestrating Monday’s plots, calling Iran “the greatest exporter of terrorism in the world.” “In all these cases, the elements behind the attacks were Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah,” Netanyahu said. “We will continue to act with a strong hand, systematically and patiently, against international terrorism, whose source is Iran.” In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney was more cautious, saying that the United States had “no information yet on who is responsible for these attacks” and adding, “We have not made a judgement yet.” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a condemnation of the bombing incidents, calling them acts of terrorism, but she avoided any accusation of responsibility. The United States is leading a global push for sanctions that it hopes will force Iran to suspend its uranium-enrichment program, while urging caution on Israel, which is weighing a preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. The United States, Israel and others suspect that Iran is trying to acquire the material and technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iran, however, says its nuclear program is aimed only at producing energy and medical isotopes. ‘Psychological warfare’ Iran’s ambassador to India, Mehdi Nebizadeh, said Iran played no role in Monday’s attack in New Delhi. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was behind the bombing incidents, which he said were intended to “tarnish Iran’s friendly ties with the host countries” and wage “psychological warfare against Iran,” according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. “Iran condemns terrorism,” the spokesman added. In New Delhi, the wife of a member of Israel’s defense mission to India and her driver, along with two people in a nearby car, were wounded when a magnetic bomb was slapped onto her car by a passing motorcyclist as she headed to pick up her children from the American Embassy School, according to accounts by Indian and Israeli officials. The woman, Tal Yehoshua-Koren, works at the Israeli Embassy and was hospitalized with moderate injuries, Israeli officials said. The attack, a few hundred yards from the prime minister’s residence, bore eerie similarities to the Jan. 11 killing of Iranian nuclear chemist Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, a 32-year-old deputy head of procurement at the Natanz enrichment facility. The scientist was killed in an explosion after an unknown assailant on a motorcycle slapped a magnetic bomb on his car as he commuted to work. Iran has openly threatened retaliation for the recent killings of its nuclear scientists and has blamed the assassinations on Israel and the United States. Clinton has categorically denied any U.S. involvement; Israeli officials have refused to comment. At about the same time as the attack in New Delhi, officials said, a grenade was found taped to the bottom of the car of a driver for the Israeli Embassy in Tbilisi, capital of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. It was safely defused. Already on high alert Netanyahu offered no specific evidence for his claim that Iran was responsible for Monday’s incidents. But Israel had put its foreign missions on high alert in recent days because of the anniversary of the death of Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah mastermind, who was killed in Damascus, Syria, on Feb. 12, 2008, when a bomb planted in a headrest in his car was detonated. Yuli Edelstein, the Israeli minister of public diplomacy, said Hezbollah and other militant groups sponsored by Iran would gain additional protection if Tehran were allowed to obtain a nuclear bomb. “If the umbrella is based on a strategic weapon — a nuclear weapon — then it will be very difficult to penetrate that umbrella,” he told Israel Radio. “As terrorist groups, it will be very comfortable for them to be under that umbrella.” But Shlomo Brom, an analyst at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, drew a distinction between Monday’s incidents and the standoff over Iran’s nuclear program. He said the bombing attempts were part of a shadow war that has been going on for years between Israel and Iran and the militant groups it supports. “This is part of the covert war between the two sides,” Brom said. “The secret war is a separate playing field and is not something new. As long as both sides want to keep it there, it won’t affect the general tension.” Denyer reported from New Delhi. Correspondents Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran and Kathy Lally in Moscow contributed to this report. ||||| Authorities in the former Soviet republic of Georgia say an explosive device was planted on the car of a driver for the Israeli Embassy but was defused. Shota Uitashvili, spokesman for the Georgian Interior Ministry, said the driver noticed a package attached to his car's undercarriage on Monday and called police. Police found a grenade in the package and it was defused, Utiashvili said. He did not specify where the car was parked when the device was discovered. The Israeli Embassy in Tbilisi declined comment. ||||| An explosion tore through an Israeli diplomat's car on the streets of New Delhi on Monday, Israeli officials said. The driver and a diplomat's wife were injured, according to Indian officials. The explosion took place in the late afternoon close to the embassy, said embassy spokesman David Goldfarb. Television footage showed a charred minivan with blue diplomatic plates, its rear door apparently blown out. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor would not discuss who was injured nor the extent of the injuries because it was a security matter. \\"We are looking into the incident and cooperation with local security forces is excellent,\\" Palmor said, from Israel. Indian foreign ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said two people were wounded, the driver and the wife of an Israeli diplomat. \\"They are in the hospital and being tended to,\\" he said.

It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock . - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies. - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity. - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\". - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air.

It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile. - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as: - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC).

Article:","completion":"Title: Tensions Rise between Obama and Putin at the G8 Summit over the Syrian Conflict The G8 Summit witnessed a tense two-hour meeting between the then US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin today. At the center of their discussion was the ongoing conflict in Syria, which exposed their differing stances on the issue as reported by the Washington Post. As global powers, both leaders expressed their desires to put an end to the violence in Syria; however, their approaches to achieve this goal seemed to diverge significantly. During the meeting, Putin candidly admitted the difference in opinions by stating, \\"Our opinions do not coincide, but all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria.\\" Obama, in his response, acknowledged this by saying, \\"We do have differing perspectives on the problem.\\" This open admission of opposing views by both leaders highlights the complicated nature of international diplomacy when it comes to resolving conflicts like the one in Syria. The tussle between both leaders could be attributed to their respective country's positions on the Syrian crisis. While the United States decided to side with the Syrian rebels, agreeing to supply them with weapons to fight against the ruling regime, Russia, on the other hand, remained a staunch supporter of President Bashar al-Assad's government by providing them with weapons supplies. This fundamental difference in their approach to address the Syrian conflict only added to the heated discussion between both leaders. Moreover, the White House announced on the same day that it would be sending an additional 300 million in aid to support the Syrian refugees, according to the BBC. It is evident that the Syrian crisis topped the G8 Summit's agenda, as the leaders attended a working dinner following the Obama-Putin meeting, with Syria continuing to be the primary topic of conversation. Anticipating further discussions on the issue, Obama was expected to persuade Britain and France to join the United States in arming the Syrian rebels. However, the real standoff between Obama and Putin manifested outside the meeting room, as reported by The Sun. A peculiar incident that could have developed into an international diplomatic dispute was averted when both leaders wanted to use the gym facilities at the same time. Obama's team was the first to request access to the gym, potentially sparking a tense battle between the leaders. In a surprising turn of events, the Russians backed down, enabling Obama to enjoy an air-conditioned workout while the \\"notoriously tough\\" Putin opted for a swim in a chilly nearby lake instead. Interestingly, Putin and Obama were neighbors during the G8 Summit, further highlighting their unavoidable proximity despite their markedly different views. In conclusion, the G8 Summit shed light on the uneasy relationship between former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin, as the Syrian conflict consistently revealed their contrasting viewpoints. The high-profile meeting between the two leaders demonstrated the inherent challenges and complexities of international diplomacy, with the future of peace and stability in Syria hanging in the balance at the time. Although the two leaders openly expressed their opposing opinions, their commitment to finding a resolution to the violence in Syria was a shared objective that could not be understated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I loved KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER since I saw it on the night it premiered on September 13, 1974. I loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by Gil Melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. When Darren McGavin's Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. It's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. He's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. Sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. In one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. He's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. He's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. He just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. If his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what I would do in the situation. That's why I was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. Kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. You were scared for him and for the other characters too. The producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. Darren McGavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a \\"monster of the week\\" show and he decided not to continue. I can tell you I mourned when this show was canceled when I was a kid but, as an adult, I can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. I still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred McGavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the INS, known as Carl Kolchak. I seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why I loved the show. It's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. The secret to it's success is right there in the title - \\"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\\". Without McGavin's lovable, bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a Night Stalker.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Eleanor Gower. UPDATED:. 19:15 EST, 30 August 2012. Ahead of tonight's premiere of the second season of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, questions have finally been answered about whether Russell Armstrong will feature in the show, following his suicide three weeks ago. The show's executive producer Douglas Ross confirmed on this morning's edition of The Today Show that the late, estranged husband of star Taylor Armstrong would not be appearing in the first few episodes. His comments came as three cast members Adrienne Maloof, Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump, spoke out for the first time since Russell's death. Re-edit: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Executive Producer Douglas Ross discussed Russell Armstrong's suicide with sstars Lisa Vanderpump, Kyle Richards and Adrienne Maloof on The Today Show this morning. 'In. the first few episodes that we've finished editing, Russell is not. included in these episodes,' Ross said during the appearance. 'But it is important to know. that Taylor's story is told throughout the season.' Media reports had suggested that the. initial cut of the series premiere featured some elements of the. couple's deteriorating relationship. Ross confirmed Bravo had made 'some adjustments' in order to be 'respectful and responsible.' Meanwhile, Adrienne, Lisa and Kyle revealed they had recently spoken to Taylor. Reaction: The reality show stars will also appear in an interview ahead of tonight's premiere episode of the show's second season. Sad reality: The demise of Taylor and Russell Armstrong's marriage is likely to be detailed in the second season of the hit show. 'She was very beside herself,' said Adrienne. 'I think her concern is her little girl now. It's heart breaking.' 'We spent a couple of evenings with her this week,' said Lisa. 'She's trying to. digest everything. 'We've tried to be as supportive as possible but her. priority is her little girl. It's been very very sad. Very difficult,' she added, referring to Taylor and Russell's five-year-old daughter Kennedy. And Kyle said news of Russell's death was a 'complete shock.' She said: 'I always saw him as being reserved and. quiet. I knew that they had their issues. But no-one could have. anticipated something like that.' But all three housewives were adamant when asked by Today show host Savannah Guthrie if appearing on the reality show had 'racked up the pressure' on Russell. 'We lead and they follow,' said Lisa. 'We create and they document. I've never felt any responsibility to bring drama. 'If you follow the lives of six people over a year, and we've all had some major issues in the last year and a half, they just tell the accurate story.' 'It's basically documenting our lives. It's reality TV and it's very real,' added Adrienne,. They also admitted there was some thought about whether the season would go ahead. 'I think we all had to reflect at some point,' admitted Adrienne. Their responses came just days after Russell's mother John Ann. Hotchkiss released a statement expressing her dissatisfaction that the season would not be delayed following her son's death by hanging at a friend's house in L.A. on August 15. Difficult: Lisa Vanderpump revealed she had spent a few evenings with cast mate Taylor Armstrong, who had been 'trying to digest' the events of the past few weeks. Speaking out: Kyle came to the defence of the reality show, saying that Russell Armstrong had signed up for season two, while Adrienne said they had to 'reflect' following the tragedy. 'When I was informed of this, I thought, \\"I hope Bravo will take the. high road and keep it tasteful. Let's not murder my son twice.\\" She. said: \\"I began to notice things starting to fray when the television. thing came into being, and I was very concerned. The programme itself. really brought him down.' However Kyle reiterated that Russell had 'signed up for season one and came back for season two.' She. added: 'When we started the show, they cast six women and they didn't. really know anything about our story. Not appearing: Russell Armstrong, seen here in a first season episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, will not be seen in the first few episodes of the new season. 'They didn't know in season one. that Kelsey was going to leave Camille or the issues between my sister. (Kim) and me. They certainly didn't know the troubles that he had.' 'This show is about. six strong, aggressive, successful beautiful women and their stories,' added Ross. 'And although Taylor and Russell's story is a part of it, it's not the. whole show. 'But we did want to address it appropriately and that's why. tonight's episode gets the entire cast together to sit down and. reflect and talk about their feelings of sadness and grief and try to. put the season we shot six months ago in perspective.' Controversial: Tonight's season premiere of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will go ahead as planned despite the Armstrong tragedy.

Tristan Tzara (French: [tRista dzaRa]; Romanian: [tris'tan 'tsara]; born Samuel or Samy Rosenstock, also known as S. Samyro; April 16 [O.S. April 4] 1896 - December 25, 1963) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. Also active as a journalist, playwright, literary and art critic, composer and film director, he was known best for being one of the founders and central figures of the anti-establishment Dada movement. Under the influence of Adrian Maniu, the adolescent Tzara became interested in Symbolism and co-founded the magazine Simbolul with Ion Vinea (with whom he also wrote experimental poetry) and painter Marcel Janco. During World War I, after briefly collaborating on Vinea's Chemarea, he joined Janco in Switzerland. S. Samyro, a partial anagram of Samy Rosenstock, was used by Tzara from his debut and throughout the early 1910s. A number of undated writings, which he probably authored as early as 1913, bear the signature Tristan Ruia, and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name Tristan. In the 1960s, Rosenstock's collaborator and later rival Ion Vinea claimed that he was responsible for coining the Tzara part of his pseudonym in 1915. Vinea also stated that Tzara wanted to keep Tristan as his adopted first name, and that this choice had later attracted him the \\"infamous pun\\" Triste Ane Tzara (French for \\"Sad Donkey Tzara\\"). This version of events is uncertain, as manuscripts show that the writer may have already been using the full name, as well as the variations Tristan Tara and Tr. Tzara, in 1913-1914 (although there is a possibility that he was signing his texts long after committing them to paper). In 1972, art historian Serge Fauchereau, based on information received from Colomba, the wife of avant-garde poet Ilarie Voronca, recounted that Tzara himself had explained his chosen name was a pun in Romanian, trist in tara, meaning \\"sad in the country\\"; Colomba Voronca was also dismissing rumors that Tzara had selected Tristan as a tribute to poet Tristan Corbiere or to Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde opera. Samy Rosenstock legally adopted his new name in 1925, after filing a request with Romania's Ministry of the Interior. The French pronunciation of his name has become commonplace in Romania, where it replaces its more natural reading as tara (\\"the land\\", Romanian pronunciation: ['tsara]).

Summarize this article: An examination of digital equipment recovered from the home of the couple who killed 14 people in San Bernardino last week has led FBI investigators to believe the shooters were planning an even larger assault, according to federal government sources. Investigators on Thursday continued to search for digital footprints left by Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, scouring a downtown San Bernardino lake for electronic items, including a hard drive that the couple was hoping to destroy, sources told The Times. FBI agents will probably spend days searching Seccombe Lake and canvassing the neighborhood for clues after receiving a tip that the couple may have visited the area on the day of the attack, according to David Bowdich, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. Farook and Malik were in the final planning stages of an assault on a location or building that housed a lot more people than the Inland Regional Center, possibly a nearby school or college, according to federal sources familiar with the widening investigation. Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. A memorial to victims of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino continues to grow near the Inland Regional Center. (Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times) Investigators have based that conclusion on evidence left behind on Farook and Malik's computers and digital devices, not all of which the couple were able to destroy before they were killed in a firefight with police, the sources said. Images of San Bernardino-area schools were found on a cellphone belonging to Farook, according to a law enforcement source. But the source cautioned that Farook may have had a legitimate reason to have the images because his work as a county health inspector involved checking on school dining facilities. On Thursday, one of the federal government sources told The Times that Farook asked his friend and neighbor, Enrique Marquez, to buy two military-style rifles used in the attacks because he feared he \\"wouldn't pass a background check\\" if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own. The rifles were bought at a local gun store, the source said. The timing of the rifle purchases is significant to FBI investigators. Another federal government source previously told The Times that Farook may have been considering a separate terror plot in 2011 or 2012. Farook was self-radicalizing around that time, FBI Director James Comey said, and met Malik soon after, eventually escorting her to the United States. Farook was a practicing Muslim. Marquez converted to Islam around the time he purchased the weapons, sources have told The Times. FBI agents believe Farook abandoned his plans to launch the earlier attack after a law enforcement task force arrested three men in Chino in November 2012. The men were later convicted of charges related to providing material support to terrorists and plotting to kill Americans in Afghanistan. A fourth man arrested in Afghanistan also was convicted in the scheme. Bowdich said federal agents are investigating whether the men had ties to Farook. Marquez has emerged as a central figure in the investigation. The FBI had been conducting interviews with 24-year-old, who checked himself into a mental health facility after the attacks. The former Wal-Mart security guard has waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with the inquiry, and it was Marquez who told FBI agents about Farook's earlier plans, according to one of the government sources, who also requested anonymity. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) \\"They were talking generally about something, but I don't think it made it to anything specific,\\" one of the sources said of the earlier plot. \\"I don't think it got to a time or a place.\\" The source said it remains unclear whether Marquez had any involvement in the planning of the shooting or had any prior knowledge that an attack was pending. Marquez, a cycling enthusiast who wanted to join the U.S. Navy, was a longtime friend and neighbor of Farook. He also married the sister of Farook's sister-in-law last year, although the circumstances of the union are now under investigation, a government official previously told The Times. There was no paperwork transferring ownership of the assault rifles from Marquez to Farook, as required by California law, government officials told The Times. Hours after the shooting, Marquez posted a cryptic message on his Facebook page. \\"I'm. Very sorry sguys,\\" the message read. \\"It was a pleasure.\\" Bowdich on Thursday declined to answer questions about Marquez, who has not been charged with a crime. Marquez told FBI agents that the Facebook post has been \\"misunderstood,\\" according to one of the government sources. Agents are concerned that Marquez's mental and emotional state may affect what he has been telling interrogators, the source said. While Marquez has spoken to agents about his ties to Farook, federal officials are still working to verify the information he has provided, the source said. Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, addressed reporters on Thursday from her Tomlinson Avenue home in Riverside, sobbing as she said she hadn't been in contact with her son since the day of the massacre. \\"I don't know how this happened.... My world is upside-down,\\" she said. \\"My life changed Wednesday.\\" Chacon was outside with one of her sons, cleaning up the broken glass and twisted panels of their garage door. The damage occurred when federal agents raided the stucco home over the weekend. As she combed through the wreckage of the garage door, Chacon eventually turned to the reporters camped out on the street and agreed to an off-camera interview. Marquez was his mother's \\"right hand at home,\\" helping take care of his brothers, she said. She said her son loved to hang out with friends and go to parties. \\"My son is a good person,\\" she said. When asked about Farook, Chacon said her son was friends with him and \\"nothing more.\\" ||||| SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (Reuters) - A week-old investigation into the shooting rampage that left 14 people dead at a holiday party in Southern California turned on Thursday to a small lake near the scene of the massacre, where divers searched for evidence. FBI agents pack up diving gear after searching in the water at Seccombe Lake Park, after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon The FBI also revealed investigators were looking into any connections there may have been between one of the two killers in San Bernardino last week and four men arrested in 2012 in a separate federal terrorism case brought in nearby Riverside, California. Thursday’s underwater search stemmed from unspecified leads indicating the married couple who carried out the shooting spree had been in the vicinity of Seccombe Lake in San Bernardino on the day of the killings, said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI field office in Los Angeles. Bowdich said he would not discuss the “specific evidence we’re looking for.” CNN reported investigators were seeking a computer hard drive that belonged to the couple, who the FBI has said were inspired by Islamic extremists. Bowdich said investigators already have combed the surrounding park, and that the search of the lake by FBI and Sheriff’s Department divers could take days. Seccombe Lake Park lies about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the Inland Regional Center, the social services agency where 14 people were killed and 22 others injured when Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, stormed a holiday gathering of his co-workers there on Dec. 2 and opened fire with assault rifles. Farook, 28, a U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were slain hours after their attack in a shootout with police. The FBI said it is treating the mass shooting as an act of terrorism, citing the couple’s declaration that they were acting on behalf of the militant group Islamic State, as well as a large cache of weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials seized in the investigation. The couple’s motives remain unclear. But if the crime proves to have been the work of killers driven by militant Islamic ideology, as the FBI suspects, it would mark the deadliest such attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2011. The latest slayings and disclosures about the killers’ backgrounds have put law U.S. law enforcement on heightened alert and reverberated into the U.S. presidential campaign, intensifying debates over gun control, immigration and national security. POSSIBLE LINKS TO 2012 PLOT EXAMINED Speaking to reporters at Seccombe Lake on Thursday, Bowdich disclosed the FBI was examining whether Farook had any links with the four conspirators in the Riverside case, as CNN and other media outlets have reported. A jury last year convicted two of those men, including Afghan-born ringleader Sohiel Omar Kabir, of conspiring to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda and plotting to attack U.S. military forces in Afghanistan. Their two co-defendants pleaded guilty in the case. CNN, citing unnamed officials, reported Farook had been a member of Kabir’s social circle. Asked whether the FBI knew of any ties between Farook and the four convicted Riverside conspirators, Bowdich said: “It would be irresponsible not to investigate.” He stressed the four Riverside defendants were never accused of planning attacks within the United States. FBI Director James Comey told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that the couple were discovered to have been discussing jihad and martyrdom online with each other as far back as 2013, a year before they met in person. Flowers and candles are displayed at a makeshift memorial after last week's shooting in San Bernardino, California December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon Comey said the precise origins of the couple’s radicalization were as yet unknown but appeared to predate the rise of Islamic State, the militant group that has seized vast swaths of Iraq and Syria and last month claimed responsibility for the assaults on Paris that left 130 dead. U.S. government sources told Reuters on Thursday that Malik tried in vain to contact multiple Islamic militant groups in the months before she and Farook staged their attack, but her overtures were ignored. The organizations Malik sought out likely shied away out of extreme caution in communicating with individuals unknown to them and a fear of being caught up in a law-enforcement “sting” operation, sources said. The number of organizations that Malik attempted to approach and how she sought to reach them were unclear, though the groups almost certainly included al Qaeda’s Syria-based official affiliate, the Nusrah Front, the government sources said. One source said investigators have little, if any, evidence that Malik or her husband had any direct contact with Islamic State. Slideshow (22 Images) LAWMAKERS BRIEFED While the militant group has since embraced the couple as among its followers, U.S. government sources have said there was no evidence Islamic State even knew of the couple before the San Bernardino killings. Comey, along with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and John Mulligan, deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed members of both houses of Congress on Thursday about the investigation in closed, classified sessions. “The current impression is that these two people were acting alone,” U.S. Senator Angus King of Maine told CNN after the briefing. But he added that he was troubled by the fact that the couple had tried to cover their tracks by destroying their cell phones and other electronic equipment. Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters afterward that there were people in the community who saw suspicious activity at the shooters’ house but decided not to tell authorities “for a variety of reasons.” New York Representative Peter King, a senior Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, emerged from the session calling for “more surveillance in the Muslim community here in the United States.” He drew comparisons to heightened scrutiny law enforcement placed on Italian-American and Irish-American communities during past investigations of organized crime. “You look where the terror is going to come from, and right now, it is going to come from the Muslim community,” he said. “It’s a small percentage, but to me, the only way you find out about it in advance is having sources and informers on the ground, having constant surveillance.” Investigators also have been looking into the couple’s ties with Enrique Marquez, a boyhood friend of Farook and Muslim convert who bought the two rifles used in the attack. A federal law enforcement source said Marquez and Farook appear to have contemplated some sort of attack around 2012 but abandoned the idea. Marquez, who is related to Farook’s family by marriage - his wife and the wife of Farook’s older brother are sisters - has not been charged with any crime. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government appears not to have picked up on extremist messages exchanged during the online courtship two years ago between the American-born man accused in the California shootings and his then-fiancée in Pakistan, according to lawmakers detailing closed-door briefings by federal officials on Capitol Hill.

But the couple never surfaced on law enforcement's radar and Malik was able to enter the U.S. on a fiancée visa last year despite having professed radical views online. Meanwhile, the investigation into the shootings that left 14 dead last week continued in San Bernardino, where an FBI dive team searched a small, urban lake about 3 miles north of the shooting site. Authorities said the shooters, who killed 14 people at a holiday gathering on Dec. 2, had been in the area. The couple died in a shootout with law enforcement hours after the attack and left behind a 6-month-old daughter. FBI Director James Comey and other senior American officials briefed members of Congress Thursday. Lawmakers repeatedly questioned officials on whether any red flags may have been missed in the last two years. One official said information that the FBI has been able to glean came from an examination of the pair's electronic devices after the attack, rather than intercepts. \\"Everyone's asking the same questions about how it is that law enforcement didn't know, or intelligence officials didn't know — that they could have flown under the radar and nothing gave an indication that they were a threat,\\" said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode island Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Malik was subjected to an in-person interview during the application process for a visa. He noted that while there were some indications that might have alerted law enforcement to Farook, he declined to detail what those might have been. \\"I don't think we know yet enough to say these were apparent without the advantage of hindsight,\\" Schiff said. Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said there's currently no evidence Malik's radicalization would have been readily apparent when she was evaluated for a fiancée visa. \\"I don't think there was missed information,\\" he said. \\"It appears that there was not any evidence that would have been discoverable during an interview for a visa.\\" He declined to discuss what specifically led investigators to conclude that the couple had radicalized independently as early as 2013, but suggested the information did not come from intercepts. Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar. \\"It's safe to say that the information about what happened prior to their marriage and to the attacks in San Bernardino was acquired through forensic investigations of these individual lives,\\" Hurd said, adding: \\"These people weren't on the radar.\\" Multiple lawmakers raised the fact that neighbors saw suspicious activities but failed to mention them to investigators until after the attack. \\"There were people who were aware of things, thought they were suspicious, but did not want to be accused of being discriminatory for reporting something,\\" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He said these people saw activity around the garage that they thought was suspicious. Asked repeatedly whether any hints could have led law enforcement to prevent the attack, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. replied, \\"Explain to me how you do that without any bread crumbs that are obvious, without somebody that's inside a mosque, that's inside a person's family that tips you off. In this particular case there was nothing like that that gave them a reason to look at this couple sooner than after the attack.\\" More than three years ago, Farook's longtime friend and relative-through-marriage Enrique Marquez bought the assault rifles used in the shooting. Marquez, who checked himself into a mental hospital after the attack, told investigators that he and Farook were plotting an attack in 2012. Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said they had an actual plan, including buying weapons, but became apprehensive and shelved it because of law enforcement activity and arrests in the area. Marquez hasn't been charged with a crime. Lawmakers said the FBI wouldn't provide details about his ties to the case, citing an \\"ongoing criminal investigation.\\" Marquez's mother Armida Chacon told reporters Thursday that her 24-year-old son is a good person. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Melley, Michael R.

It appears that the couple behind the shootings may have been planning an even larger assault on a location with more people, such as a college or school, and other clues found by the FBI suggest that they were planning to target a location in the next few days at the time of the shootings. Images of nearby schools were found on a cellphone that belonged to one of the attackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, but these may be legitimate images as his work involved checking on school dining facilities."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Always cut and then stamp, so you can ensure that the stamp fits onto the cookie. Steps: Step 1: Roll out the cookie dough to the desired thickness using a rolling pin. Step 2: Use a cookie cutter to cut out the desired shapes from the dough. Step 3: Press the cookie stamp gently onto the cut cookies, ensuring the stamp fits perfectly on each cookie. Justification: By cutting the cookies first, you will have the desired shape ready before applying the stamp pattern.

Step 2: Identify the two criteria According to the given information, case studies should meet the criteria of accuracy and lack of bias. These two criteria are essential for maintaining the quality of case studies. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the two criteria It is stated that evaluators should make sure that their personal opinions do not distort case studies, and they must be evenhanded in examining all aspects of a situation.

Its name resonates through the culinary world for its select culinary artistry reflecting the traditional yet innovative Chinese food it offers to its mature clientele. The restaurant's ethos is embedded in delivering the rich tapestry of Chinese gastronomy, providing its customers an array of dishes that are not only palatable but also aesthetically pleasing. From succulent Peking duck to spicy Szechuan delicacies, Loch Fyne curates each dish with immense attention to detail, ensuring a sublime feast for the senses. Despite its lack of family-friendly activities and services, it stands as a beacon for lovers of Chinese cuisine seeking an exclusive and high-end dining environment. The ambiance of Loch Fyne leans toward an elevated, mature atmosphere, more akin to a quiet, intimate dinner rather than a boisterous family gathering. While the name Loch Fyne might imply a Scottish origin, the restaurant diverges from the traditional local food of the highlands, instead, it ventures into the enigmatic and diverse world of Chinese food. This mesmerising blend of different food cultures under one roof has managed to catch the attention of food connoisseurs and critics, who often laud Loch Fyne for its bold and experimental approach to Chinese cuisine. Its matured and polished audiences often engage in insightful conversations, leaving an eloquent baritone murmur hovering above the clinking of fine china and silver cutlery. Often it's the hub for business meetings and romantic dinners, which require a sophisticated environment that the restaurant maintains meticulously. Loch Fyne reinforces the idea that dining out is not just about feeding your hunger, but it's an immersive experience involving all of your senses. The restaurant offers an escape from the mundane, a chance to delve into an exotic culinary adventure. With Loch Fyne, the journey to experience authentic and elegant Chinese cuisine is just as appealing as the destination itself. However, given its grown-up allure and its unique food experiences that it offers, it does little to attract families, especially those with younger children. In conclusion, Loch Fyne is a restaurant that is uniquely positioned within the market. It provides a mature, upscale ambiance and a focused culinary experience that centers around Chinese cuisine. It's not a destination for family outings, but instead an ideal location for those seeking out an exclusive, adult-oriented culinary adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There’s nothing else like that.” The shares have climbed 13 percent this year, fueled by sales of the iPad and iPhone, and a burgeoning business in China. Apple fell 2.3 percent to 363.69 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon declined 4.4 percent to 68.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. Oil Futures Exxon has tumbled since trading in July at more than 85 a share, as oil futures in New York have dropped. Exxon bought XTO Energy Inc. last year to tap natural-gas shale deposits in North America and is seeking to buy more gas reserves, even as futures remain about 4 per million British thermal units. “Two things that I would definitely say have hurt Exxon are lower oil prices and its increasing reliance on natural gas,” said Philip Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. Weiss, whose family owns some Exxon shares, has a “buy” rating on the company. Apple, meanwhile, is poised to increase computer sales as much as twofold over the next few years, and the iPhone business may triple in size, Wu said. If successful, the company’s new iCloud music and information-storage service, which only works with Apple products, could further lock its customers into buying the company’s devices. Profit Surge Apple’s profit more than doubled last quarter to 7.31 billion on revenue of 28.6 billion. The company had record sales of iPhones and iPads -- products that didn’t exist five years ago -- and they now account for about two-thirds of revenue. Apple also has accumulated 76.2 billion in cash and other holdings. Even so, the company’s profits are eclipsed by Exxon’s. Analysts estimate that Apple’s net income will reach almost 26 billion in the fiscal year ending in September, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with about 42 billion for Exxon in calendar 2011. The gulf between the companies’ revenue is even larger. Apple’s sales will be 108.1 billion this fiscal year, analysts estimate. For Exxon, the projection is 481.6 billion. Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs, who co-founded the company at the age of 21, was ousted by the board in 1985. When he returned 12 years later, Apple had run up 1.86 billion in losses over two years. It was 90 days away from bankruptcy, Jobs would later say. New Markets He engineered the company’s comeback by honing Apple’s industrial design, tightly integrating software with hardware, and pushing into new markets, such as phones, music and tablets. The iPhone, introduced in 2007, has become Apple’s best- selling product and turned the company into the world’s biggest smartphone maker. After winning customers away from Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) and Nokia Oyj, Apple is now sparring with Google Inc. for leadership in the market for mobile-phone software. The company stoked recent growth with a new version of its Mac computer operating system called OS X Lion, along with updated computers. ICloud, meanwhile, will let users store, synchronize and access files from different Apple devices. Apple’s shares are up from an adjusted 5.48 on Sept. 16, 1997, the day Jobs retook the reins as head of the company. To contact the reporter on this story: Adam Satariano in San Francisco at asatariano1@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net ||||| The iPhone and iPad maker had the lead for much of the afternoon before its stock closed just behind Exxon's. The two companies are so close that Apple is likely to keep the top spot soon. Apple Inc.'s stock gained 5.9 percent to 374.01 on Tuesday, bringing its market capitalization to about 347 billion. Exxon Mobil Corp.'s stock, meanwhile, closed up 2.1 percent at 71.64. That gives the oil company a market cap of 348 billion. Its stock was down earlier in the day, allowing Apple to take the lead. Other big-name corporations, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and General Electric Co., don't even come close. Apple overtook Microsoft Corp., the previous No. 2, just last year. Does this mean people need iPads more than oil? \\"Exxon obviously sells a product that people need. Apple sells a product that people want,\\" said Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher & Co. who follows Apple. Exxon, which set a record in 2008 for the highest quarterly earnings by any company, has limited growth prospects, which are driven by oil prices and discovering new oil. It's growing, but not as quickly as Apple, which is charging ahead at the pace of a startup, Marshall says, even though the company is 35 years old. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, California, has been on a roll with the soaring popularity of its iPad tablet computer and strong sales of the iPhone. Its growth is limited only by innovation. Investors expect it to grow as long as it keeps making products that people want. So investors are betting on Apple's stock even though it currently makes less money than Exxon. In its latest quarterly report, Apple said stronger iPhone and iPad sales helped more than double its net income to 7.31 billion and grow revenue by 82 percent to 28.6 billion. Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, posted a 41 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings to 10.68 billion, the largest since it set a record of 14.8 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Its revenue grew 36 percent to 125.5 billion. International companies that vie for the most valuable spot in the world include PetroChina Co., the publicly traded unit of China's biggest oil and gas company, and Petrobras, Brazil's state-controlled energy company. In the U.S., Exxon and General Electric had been trading off the No. 1 and No. 2 spots until Microsoft surpassed them both in early 1999, at the height of the dot-com boom. By 2000, though, GE was No. 1 once again. According to data from FactSet, the three were close over the next five years, though Apple was ascending quickly. Exxon Mobil, which is based in Irving, Texas, took the top spot in 2005 and, for now, remained there on Tuesday. Marshall believes Apple may pass yet another milestone next year, when it's likely to surpass Hewlett-Packard Co. as the world's largest technology company by revenue. In the quarter that ended in April, HP reported 31.6 billion in revenue, compared with Apple's 28.6 billion in the just-ended period. HP reports results for the May-July period next week. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Apple Inc. surpassed Exxon Mobil Corp. to become the world's most valuable company, reflecting investor confidence in high-tech growth prospects over the oil industry. Although both companies experienced a decline, Exxon fell more, resulting in a market value of 330.8 billion compared to Apple's 337.2 billion at the close of U.S. markets. The milestone followed Apple's transformation from a struggling personal computer company into a leading seller of smartphones and digital music, and came after Apple had already overtaken major technology companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Intel in market value. With a focus on innovation, Apple's growth continues to rapidly accelerate, driven by sales of its popular iPad, iPhone, and increasing business in China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes.

Time appears to have a direction—the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modeled by a parameter in the system being analyzed, where there is no \\"proper time\\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the Second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy); the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only traveling forwards in time (see light cone). In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above. The standard description of measurement in quantum mechanics is also time asymmetric (see Measurement in quantum mechanics). What laws specify as an arrow of time? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Some laws that specify an arrow of time include: 1. The Second Law of Thermodynamics: This law states that entropy, or the degree of disorder in a system, tends to increase over time. This provides a natural direction for the arrow of time, as processes tend to move from a state of lower entropy to higher entropy. 2. The Cosmological Arrow of Time: This arrow of time points away from the Big Bang, the event that started our universe. The expansion of the universe from the initial singularity to the present and continuing into the future provides a direction for the arrow of time. 3. The Radiative Arrow of Time: This arrow of time is caused by light only traveling forwards in time, as represented by the concept of the light cone. Electromagnetic waves, such as light, always propagate forward in time, providing a clear indication of the direction of time. 4. Time Asymmetry in Particle Physics: The violation of CP symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation and parity symmetry) in some particle interactions implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve the overall CPT symmetry (the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal symmetry). While most of these laws and phenomena don't directly specify the arrow of time, they do offer a means to effectively distinguish between the past and the future, providing an implied direction for time's arrow in various situations and contexts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Lycaenidae is the second-largest family of butterflies (behind Nymphalidae, brush-footed butterflies), with over 6,000 species worldwide, whose members are also called gossamer-winged butterflies. They constitute about 30% of the known butterfly species. - Polyommatinae, the blues, are a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae). It was long used to assign taxa of unclear relationships, and its contents are in need of revision. Several genera might not even belong here. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Nabokovia is a Neotropical genus of butterflies , named by Arthur Francis Hemming in honour of Vladimir Nabokov , who extensively studied the Polyommatinae subfamily .

Answer: In some micro climates or shaded areas these rather 'basic' tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them, however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable. Question: how long is a flat membrane roof good for? Answer:","completion":"A flat membrane roof's longevity depends on various factors such as the type of material used, installation quality, climate, and maintenance. Among the commonly used materials for flat membrane roofs are Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO), Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). These modern membranes have become more affordable in recent years, making them an attractive option for many building owners and contractors. TPO is a popular choice for flat membrane roofs due to its energy efficiency and durability. TPO roofs typically have a lifespan of 22 to 30 years when properly maintained. They are resistant to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, chemicals, and punctures, making them a suitable option for various climates and environments. EPDM roofs, also known as rubber roofs, are known for their flexibility and resistance to various weather conditions. With proper installation and maintenance, EPDM roofs have a lifespan of around 25 to 30 years. They can withstand extreme temperatures, UV radiation, and exposure to chemicals. PVC roofs are another popular choice for flat membrane roofs due to their durability and resistance to chemicals, fire, and punctures. With proper care, a PVC roof can last between 25 to 35 years. This type of roof offers excellent protection against harsh weather conditions, making it an ideal option for regions with heavy rain, snow, or wind. The quality of installation plays a significant role in determining a flat membrane roof's lifespan. Expert installation by qualified professionals ensures that the roof is appropriately sealed and protected against water infiltration and other potential issues that could affect its durability. Regular maintenance, including inspections, cleaning, and timely repairs, is essential in maintaining the roof's condition and maximizing its lifespan. Considering these factors, a flat membrane roof can generally last between 22 to 35 years, with variations depending on the type of material used, installation quality, and maintenance practices. Ultimately, the longevity of a flat membrane roof is influenced by the specific materials and environmental conditions, so it is crucial to choose the right materials and maintain them properly for optimal performance and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jordan first earned the nickname \\"Air Jordan\\" during his initial years in the NBA due to his ability to seemingly defy gravity with his amazing vertical leap and acrobatic dunks. As for the specific time when Michael Jordan truly displayed the \\"Air Jordan\\" persona, it is often regarded as the NBA Slam Dunk Contest that took place on February 6, 1988. Held in Chicago, during the NBA All-Star Weekend, Jordan executed a series of breathtaking dunks that left audiences in awe. During the contest, Jordan faced stiff competition from Dominique Wilkins, another high-flying dunker and a two-time winner of the contest. Both players managed to impress the judges in the first rounds with their powerful and athletic dunks. The climax of the competition came in the final round when Michael Jordan unveiled his now-iconic dunk, which is still considered one of the most famous dunks in basketball history. The dunk, dubbed the \\"Kiss the Rim\\" or \\"Free-Throw Line Dunk,\\" saw Jordan take off from just inside the free-throw line with the ball in his right hand, soaring toward the hoop while switching the ball to his left hand and finally slamming it in. His display of athleticism, hang time, and incredible leaping ability during this contest helped solidify his image as \\"Air Jordan.\\" Jordan won the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, marking his second consecutive win, having also won the contest in 1987.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The two sentences express different points of view on a matter, which means that they each convey a different sentiment or tone. Their truthfulness depends on the context in which they are being used. Sentence 1—Well, that's a nice way of putting it—implies that the speaker approves of how a thought, idea, or situation has been described. It suggests that the speaker feels the description is polite, respectful, or even diplomatic. Sentence 2—That is a mean way to phrase it—conveys that the speaker takes issue with how an idea or situation has been expressed. They find the phrasing negative, harsh, or judgmental. Looking at both sentences, one must consider the context in which each statement is made. If they are applied to the same situation, it means that two individuals have differing opinions on the language used to describe a situation or idea. In this case, their truthfulness would not be in direct opposition, but rather display subjective opinions on how to best communicate a certain matter. Instead of focusing on whether one sentence is true and the other false, it is important to consider the range of opinions and emotions involved. People might interpret the phrasing of a statement differently, and the truthfulness of each sentence would depend on the perspective of the person making the judgment. In short, if the first sentence is true according to the speaker's perspective, it doesn't necessarily mean the second sentence must be false. Both sentences can be true from different points of view, or they could both be false, depending on how the description is received and interpreted by the listener.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. – In traditional, opposite-sex relationships, most women still do the vast majority of chores—regardless of how many hours they work or how much money they make. But for same-sex couples, where there isn't the traditional gender-based division of labor to fall back on, the chores are more often shared and divvied up according to personal preference. So finds a survey of 103 same-sex couples and 122 straight couples put out this week by the Families and Work Institute; all were dual-earner couples. Though NBC News reports same-sex couples didn't share an \\"overabundance\\" of chores, they did out-share their straight counterparts in a number of areas: In same-sex couples, 74% share child care, 62% share sick child care, 44% share laundry, and 33% share household repair. The corresponding figures for straight couples are 38%, 32%, 31%, and 15%. So does that increased sharing lead to increased happiness regarding chores? Perhaps surprisingly, not hugely. \\"I probably went in with the bias that sharing is going to be better,\\" acknowledges the diversity strategy leader for study-sponsor PwC. But on a scale where 5 is most satisfied, when it comes to the division of household responsibilities, gay men scored 4.18 and lesbians scored 3.99; straight men scored 4.02 and straight women 3.82. There was a happiness trigger, though: communication. Per the study, \\"When couples discussed what each one wants in terms of labor division, their overall happiness went up markedly, and when they did not, they were much more likely to be dissatisfied with their domestic workload.\\" Study author Ken Matos highlights the finding. \\"That's probably the biggest takeaway of the survey,\\" he tells the Washington Post. \\"How important it is to talk and say what you want. ... The people who said they bit their tongue had a lower satisfaction with division of household responsibilities.\\" (Should women simply let things get dirty?) Expand this summary.","completion":"A recent survey by the Families and Work Institute has found that same-sex couples tend to share household chores more equally than their straight counterparts. The survey included 103 same-sex couples and 122 straight couples, all of whom were dual-earner couples. Results showed that in same-sex couples, 74% shared childcare, 62% shared sick childcare, 44% shared laundry duties, and 33% shared household repairs. In comparison, the figures for straight couples were 38%, 32%, 31%, and 15% respectively. However, this increased sharing of chores did not necessarily lead to increased satisfaction regarding household responsibilities. On a satisfaction scale where 5 is the most satisfied, gay men scored 4.18, lesbians 3.99, straight men 4.02, and straight women 3.82. The study found that communication was the key factor in improving satisfaction levels. When couples discussed their preferences for the division of labor, their overall happiness increased significantly. In contrast, those who did not engage in such conversations tended to be more dissatisfied with their domestic workload. According to study author Ken Matos, the main takeaway from the survey is the importance of open communication about individual preferences and needs within couples. Clear communication leads to better satisfaction regarding the division of household responsibilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They might collaborate by sharing tasks, like writing entries or interacting with readers. This would make sense given that they mention \\"all the blogging while Eric sleeps.\\" 2. Friend or roommate: It's possible that the person is a close friend or lives with Eric, and thus knows his daily routines and habits.

The fact that they know when he gets up, has breakfast, and other specifics imply that they have a close connection. 3.

If they live together and share responsibilities, it's likely that they are aware of each other's daily activities and help each other out when necessary. 4. Caregiver or personal assistant: There is also a chance that the person is a hired caregiver or personal assistant to Eric. This would explain their knowledge of his daily habits and their role in taking care of important tasks, such as blogging, while he rests.

He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store. Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from ZDNet, considered the interface to be \\"clumsy and impractical\\" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it \\"two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together\\"), and concluded that \\"Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad.\\" Answer:","completion":"Both Bright and Warren say that the interface design of Windows 8 has some issues.
