Answer the following question: Article: From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold _ of losing their jobs as a global recession starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad.

Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the straight man protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, as well as in other television series, films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. Henson originally performed Kermit until his death in 1990; Steve Whitmire performed Kermit from that time up until his dismissal from the role in 2016. Jim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, Sam and Friends. Brian Henson described his father's performance as Kermit as \\"coming out of his own personality--was a wry intelligence, a little bit of a naughtiness, but Kermit always loved everyone around and also loved a good prank.\\" He continued to perform the character until his death in 1990. Henson's last known performance as Kermit was for an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show to promote The Muppets at Walt Disney World. Henson died twelve days after that appearance. Following Henson's death, veteran Muppet performer Steve Whitmire was named Kermit's new performer. In 2017, Whitmire seemed to imply in a blog post that Jim Henson had asked him to assume the role before he died, though Jim's daughter Cheryl Henson claimed Brian had selected him after Jim's death. Whitmire's first public performance as Kermit was at the end of the television special The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson in 1990. He remained Kermit's principal performer until 2016. Disney announced that Matt Vogel would be taking over as the performer and voice for Kermit on July 10, 2017. Whitmire later revealed that he had not chosen to voluntarily leave the role, but rather, had been recast by Muppet Studios in October 2016. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter later in July 2017, Whitmire elaborated he was fired for two reasons: long-term creative disagreements over Kermit's characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations that delayed his involvement in Muppet-related productions. For a brief demonstration at MuppetFest (a 2001 Muppet fan convention), Muppet performer John Kennedy performed Kermit opposite Whitmire's performance of young Kermit (from Kermit's Swamp Years). Kennedy also performed Kermit for Muppets Ahoy!, a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show (though Whitmire performed Kermit for the first few shows). Muppet performer Artie Esposito briefly performed Kermit in 2009 for a few personal appearances (an appearance on America's Got Talent, an appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards, and at the 2009 D23 Expo with Rowlf the Dog as part of a tribute to Jim Henson). Voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of Baby Kermit on the animated Saturday morning cartoon, Muppet Babies. He also provided the voice of an adult Kermit for a short-lived spin-off, Little Muppet Monsters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many years had he been the performer?","completion":"Steve Whitmire had been the performer of Kermit the Frog from 1990 until his dismissal from the role in 2016, which is a total of 26 years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B? Answer:","completion":"In the situation you described with Greg, an electrical engineer, inspecting two houses, we can analyze each case based on the information provided and determine in which case the incoming and outgoing current wires touch each other. Case A: The house with a short circuit. In this scenario, as mentioned, there is a short circuit present. A short circuit occurs when the wire carrying current into the circuit comes into direct contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire. This connection bypasses the designed resistors and/or appliances present in the circuit, eliminating any resistance and allowing a larger current to flow through the wiring. Such a situation can be dangerous, causing electrical fires or damaging electronics connected to the affected circuit. In this case, the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other because it is the root cause of a short circuit. Case B: The house without a short circuit. In this scenario, the electrical wiring is as expected, and the house is not experiencing any short circuits. Therefore, the proper resistances exist throughout the circuits, ensuring that the incoming and outgoing current wires never touch directly. Appliances connected to the circuit receive the appropriate amount of current to operate safely, and the wiring remains safe from overheating or other potential dangers. In this case, the incoming and outgoing current wires would not touch each other as the circuit is working accurately and safely. In conclusion, the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other in Case A, the house with a short circuit, while they would not touch each other in Case B, the house with proper electrical wiring and no short circuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province? is inside the article: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians., can you guess it ?

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Top Eight Energy Risks For 2013 What’s hot and what’s not for the energy world in 2013? With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage. Summary:","completion":"The top energy risks for 2013 include the following: 1) The Middle East and North Africa unrest and secession struggles, which revolve around political secession and may lead to a rise in oil prices. 2) Producer states might overreact to falling oil prices, with many countries such as Russia, Central Asian nations, and Latin America facing increased pressure on budgets. 3) The Iranian nuclear situation could come to a head, though it is expected to remain a stalemate with sanctions in place. 4) Russia's internal energy war between Rosneft and Gazprom, with Rosneft becoming the new national champion of choice. 5) The United States shale gas gains and potential LNG exports, though limited amounts are expected to be signed off next year. 6) The perceived shift in U.S. and Chinese roles in global energy supplies, with 2/3 of global oil supplies sitting on politically shaky ground. These risks underpin the uncertainties in the energy world going into 2013."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they haven't eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance. Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled.

The jury has decided, and he's walking. Whatever we may think of the Edwards trial, one thing is certain: the prosecution was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime. Who cares if a billionaire wants to give a multimillionaire some money to hide his mistress (who pays taxes on the gift)? The prosecution of Edwards was never so much about Edwards as it was about George Holding. Wait -- who is George Holding? And why should we care? After winning a recent primary, Holding is likely the next congressman in the 13th District of North Carolina. He initiated the prosecution against Edwards while he was a U.S. Attorney. But he didn't argue the case in court. Instead, after receiving a year's worth of headlines (and Republican praise) for charging Edwards, Holding resigned from the case to run for Congress. Of course, prosecuting OPTIONS: - Andrew Young wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - CNN wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Congress wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - George Holding wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Holding wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Jeff Smith wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - John Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - North Carolina wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Republican wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - Smith wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. - U.S. wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress.","completion":"Of course, prosecuting John Edwards wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. It seems that the pursuit of this case was more about enhancing Holding's political career than it was about achieving justice. With the media attention the case garnered, Holding was able to capitalize on his role as the prosecutor, even though he stepped down from the case before it went to court. The fact that the jury ultimately decided against sending Edwards to prison suggests that the case may not have been as strong as it initially seemed. Yet, Holding's decision to focus on such a high-profile target has allowed him to ride the wave of publicity all the way to a likely seat in Congress. This situation raises questions about the motivations behind certain legal actions by ambitious politicians seeking to make a name for themselves. Moreover, the Edwards trial serves as a cautionary example of the potential dangers of allowing political ambitions to influence legal processes. When prosecutors focus on cases that will generate attention, rather than on those that are truly deserving of their time and resources, it can lead to the unjust treatment of individuals involved. Additionally, it diverts attention from other more serious matters that require the time and expertise of skilled prosecutors with the best interests of the public in mind. In the end, the question of whether or not John Edwards deserves to go to prison remains a matter of personal opinion and debate. What is clear, however, is that the prosecution of Edwards served the interests of George Holding far more than it did the interests of justice. As Holding moves on to his new role in Congress, one can only hope that he will strive to bring about change in a way that truly serves the needs of his constituents, rather than focusing on furthering his own career through the manipulation of public opinion and political maneuvering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was warmly welcomed by the staff, and the ambience immediately enveloped me in an aura of sheer sophistication and elegance. Right from the start, our server, Ricky, was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. He recommended the chef's special five-course tasting menu, and after hearing the mouthwatering descriptions of each dish, we couldn't resist. Ricky also suggested a perfect wine pairing for our meal, showing an impressive understanding of not only the cuisine but also the accompanying beverages. The first course, Seared Scallops with Cauliflower Puree, set the tone for the evening. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the puree was velvety and rich. The dish was artfully plated, featuring an impressive balance of colors, textures, and flavors. Next came the second course, an exquisite Heirloom Tomato Salad with fresh burrata and a basil-lemon vinaigrette. The tomatoes were plump, juicy, and full of flavor, complemented by the creaminess of the burrata and the zesty vinaigrette. Needless to say, I savored every bite. The third course showcased a perfectly cooked Chilean Sea Bass with asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes. The sea bass was succulent and melted in my mouth, while the asparagus was crunchy and fresh, accompanied by the robustly flavored sun-dried tomatoes. It was visually stunning and absolutely delicious. Our fourth course, which happened to be my favorite, was the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with rosemary-garlic potatoes and mint chimichurri. The lamb was exceptionally tender, and the herbs and mint chimichurri added layers of complexity that tantalized my taste buds. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making it a match made in heaven. Finally, we concluded our meal with a delightful Chocolate Lava Cake with raspberry coulis and fresh berries. The lava cake was oozing with warm, gooey chocolate that tantalized my senses, while the tartness of the raspberry coulis and berries perfectly cut through the richness of the chocolate. Throughout the evening, Ricky checked up on us frequently, ensuring that our glasses were always full and our questions about each dish were answered in detail. His attentiveness and charm added a personal touch to the already exceptional dining experience. Cocina De Luna has redefined fine dining for me.

There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way.

Please answer this question: Which island, a former Dutch colony with its capital at Orangestad, continues to move slowly towards complete independence?","completion":"The island you're referring to is Aruba, which is a small island located in the southern Caribbean Sea, just north of the coast of Venezuela. It covers an area of about 179 square kilometers (69 square miles) and has a population of around 106,000 people. The capital of Aruba is Oranjestad, a vibrant city that serves as the island's hub for commerce, tourism, and culture. Aruba has a rich history that includes colonization by the Dutch in the early 17th century. The Dutch established their presence on the island in 1636 when they claimed possession of it from the indigenous Caquetio Indians. They ruled Aruba for over two centuries under the jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company until it became a colony of the Netherlands in 1815. During the 20th century, Aruba began to seek greater autonomy from the Netherlands. In 1954, it achieved a certain degree of self-government as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which also included the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba decided to separate from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate and autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. There were initial plans for Aruba to gain complete independence by 1996, but the process was halted in 1990 due to concerns about the island's economic stability and sustainability. Since then, Aruba has maintained its status as a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands but continues to steadily move towards greater autonomy and potentially full independence. In recent years, there has been an increased push for self-determination, with various political parties and movements advocating for more control over the island's natural resources, environment, and economic policies. The issue of independence remains a topic of debate among the Aruban population, balancing the potential benefits of complete self-governance against the costs and uncertainties of disconnecting from the Dutch support system. While Aruba has not yet achieved complete independence, it continues to cultivate its unique identity, culture, and political system, which could shape the island's future relationship with the Netherlands. In conclusion, the island of Aruba is a former Dutch colony with its capital at Oranjestad that continues to move slowly towards independence. As a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has been gradually asserting more of its autonomy and self-governance over the past decades. With an evolving political landscape and an ongoing debate on the benefits and challenges of full independence, Aruba's future remains a subject of discussion and interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Consider the given premise: \\"You will now watch an instructional film to see just what kind of stress the people in medieval ages had to deal with.\\" - This suggests that people in the medieval ages indeed experienced stress, and the film will provide a portrayal of some of the stressors they faced. 2. Evaluate the hypothesis: \\"People in the medieval ages had little stress.\\" - Based on the premise, which confirms that people in the medieval ages faced stress, this hypothesis is implying the opposite. Conclusion: Given the information from the premise, which suggests that people in medieval ages experienced stress and the instructional film will be providing examples of the stress they had to deal with, the hypothesis, \\"People in the medieval ages had little stress\\" is not true.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: It's hard to say which comes out on top, James Cagney's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of Busby Berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close. I give it a tie, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals. Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line. And what's the story line? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals, and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. He starts doing Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them, moving them around the country. He's a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise-cracking secretary, loves him but he's too busy too notice; an office girl in black-rimmed, round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him; his partners are cheating him...my gosh, what's next? This may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done. Instead of \\"Let's put on a show, gang\\" we have \\"We need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing.\\" These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty. And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save Chester's skin or not. First up is \\"Honeymoon Hotel\\" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some might even be married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with \\"Do not disturb\\" signs. Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of \\"By a Waterfall\\" that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a Depression on. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. The girls are sure game. They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious. And finally, the smash finale...11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to \\"Shanghai Lil,\\" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, unusual in that the races are mixed up. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, Cagney fighting. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught. Then...this is true...a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt, a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes. That's entertainment, folks. It's great! Of course, Chester's Prologues get the big contract and Nan gets Chester. The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along. Joan Blondell makes us forget about a lot of Hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality. The movie, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs and shakes it, and to Berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into key aspects and evaluate the tone and emotions conveyed. 1. Praise for James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Busby Berkeley's work: The review speaks highly of their performances and contributions, showing admiration. 2.

Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What is the problem in Sandy and Susan's marriage? Title: Carnal Knowledge Movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy. Susan therefore has a purely intellectual relationship with Sandy, while at the same having a purely physical relationship with Jonathan. Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \\"perfect woman.\\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of Jonathan's requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Sandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better.

Answer:","completion":"Remy moved to the city after being tired of all the work on the farm due to various reasons, which can be broadly categorized into personal, social, and economic factors. These factors collectively played a significant role in shaping Remy's decision, making them leave their rural life behind to embrace the urban lifestyle. 1. Personal Factors: a. Exhaustion: One of the primary reasons Remy was tired of farm work could be the physical strain involved in it. The effort required to tend to crops, look after the livestock, and maintain the property can be taxing on an individual's physical and mental health. Bidding farewell to the farm life was an attempt by Remy to seek respite from the constant hard work and seek a more comfortable and relaxed lifestyle in the city. b. Adventure: Possibly, Remy wanted to experience more in life, explore new ventures, and step out of their comfort zone. Moving to the city might have been a way to venture into the unknown, meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy new experiences that farm life couldn't offer. 2. Social Factors: a. Limited social circle: The rural lifestyle often comes with limited opportunities to meet and interact with new people. Remy might have desired to expand their social circle, network with diverse individuals, and create new relationships, both personal and professional. The city offers a more vibrant social scene, and its diverse population is appealing to those seeking a more dynamic network. b. Education and exposure: Remy might have been keen to gain more knowledge and exposure by pursuing higher education or attending workshops, seminars, and other events. The city often offers better opportunities for personal and professional development than a rural setting. The availability of resources such as experienced professionals, technological advancements, and varied cultural experiences could have been significant factors that attracted Remy to the city. 3. Economic Factors: a. Job opportunities: Farm work, while providing a livelihood, might not be financially rewarding or provide job security. Remy might have been motivated to move to the city in search of stable and well-paying employment with potential advancement opportunities. Urban settings typically offer a broader range of job prospects that cater to different skill sets and expertise. b. Infrastructure and facilities: The city provides better infrastructure and facilities such as healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. Remy might have decided to move to the city to benefit from a more organized and faster-paced life that provides easier access to necessary amenities. c. Diversified income sources: Relying solely on agriculture-related income can be a risky proposition, mainly due to unpredictability caused by weather conditions and market factors. Remy may have moved to the city to secure and diversify their income sources, ensuring a more stable financial future. In conclusion, Remy's decision to move to the city after being tired of farm work was shaped by personal factors such as exhaustion and the drive for adventure, social factors such as the need for an expanded social network and personal development, and economic factors like job opportunities, better infrastructure, and diversified income sources. The city promised an opportunity for Remy to enjoy new experiences, connect with a broader range of people, and secure a more stable financial future while benefiting from the resources and facilities that urban life offers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The appointment of crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep Richard Scudamore in a job demonstrates how seriously the Premier League are taking the chief executive’s sexist emails scandal. Milltown Partners, who specialise in discreet reputational work for high-end clients, was founded by Paddy Harverson, former Royal spin doctor, and ex-Google executive DJ Collins. And BBC sports editor David Bond is set to join. The choice of Milltown also highlights the cosy governance set-up at the Premier League, which has to be reformed even if Scudamore stays in office. All-powerful Scudamore’s effective line managers are the PL’s audit and remuneration committee, who decide his bonus and salary. Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore. Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman. And that group is chaired by Scudamore’s close friend and shooting partner Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea. And Chelsea happen to be another client of Milltown. As a result, there are growing concerns as to whether Buck should remain chairman of the A and R group. The PL strongly defend their ridiculous two-strong board of Scudamore and interim chairman Peter McCormick, whose Harrogate firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the PL. The PL claim the 20 clubs, who meet at least six times a year, are the directors of the company. But their one-eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes. Sofa time: Steven Gerrard will pause his World Cup preparations to work with ITV for the Champions League final. England captain Steven Gerrard will be a guest pundit with ITV for the Champions League final. Gerrard will now be spending a fortnight in Portugal. He is on holiday this week, followed by training with England at Vale do Lobo before the final in Lisbon. PREMIER LEAGUE sponsors Barclays, who have reportedly voiced upset over Scudamore’s sexist emails, are to change PR agencies. It is widely expected that Barclays will not renew their current three-year deal with the top flight, but they will hire Havas and instruct them to do a root-and-branch look into how much value the £40m-a-year PL backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost-cutting exercise. THE highly prestigious Footballer of the Year function was relegated to a cramped basement room at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel because of a switch of dates. The main reception suite, instead of being adorned with evocative pictures of every winner of the Football Writers Association award, was booked by the British Sandwich Industry. And rather than Luis Suarez being honoured in the big room, it was a BBQ chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt. Ian’s priorities wrong. It will not please followers of rugby league giants Wigan Warriors that their chairman Ian Lenagan has chosen to go to the FA Cup final rather than his club’s Super League Magic Weekend clash with Leeds at the Etihad Stadium. Lenagan is also chairman of League Two football team Oxford United and an FA councillor. He was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of Hull City owner Assem Allam being allowed to change the name of the club to Hull Tigers which the FA voted to reject. Meanwhile, it’s understood the astonishing decision for the Hull KR v Hull Super League fixture to be staged in Manchester at the same time as Hull City take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley wasn’t opposed by Hull rugby league club owner Adam Pearson. He used to be head of operations at the football club, but had an acrimonious exit following Allam’s takeover.

Matthew Syed might have been discarded by Joey Barton as ghost writer for his upcoming autobiography but the Times sports columnist has emerged as front runner to be the next BBC Sports Editor.

Verify the language: First, I will recognize that 'Kosher' is a term from the Hebrew language, which is commonly used in the context of Jewish culture and religion. 2.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

A Muhammad cartoon a day When Salman Rushdie mocked Islamic sanctities in his magical 1989 realist novel “The Satanic Verses,” Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini did something shockingly original: He issued a death edict on Rushdie and all those connected to the production of his book. By doing this, Khomeini sought to impose Islamic mores and laws on the West. We don’t insult the prophet, he effectively said, and neither can you. That started a trend of condemning those in the West deemed anti-Islamic that persists to this day. Again and again, when Westerners are perceived as denigrating Muhammad, the Koran, or Islam, Islamists demonstrate, riot or kill. Khomeini’s edict also had the unexpected side effect of empowering individuals – Western and Islamist alike – to drive their countries’ policies. Fleming Rose, a newspaper editor, created the greatest crisis for Denmark since World War II by publishing 12 cartoons depicting Muhammad. Florida pastor Terry Jones sowed panic among American commanders in Afghanistan by threatening to burn a Koran. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and friends prompted a crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations with his amateurish \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video. And the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo caused the French government to temporarily shut down diplomatic missions in 20 countries. Plans by the German satirical magazine Titanic to publish attacks on Muhammad likewise led German missions to be closed. On the Islamist side, an individual or group took one of these perceived offenses and turned it into a reason to riot. Khomeini did this with “The Satanic Verses.” Ahmad Abu Laban did likewise with the Danish cartoons. Afghan President Hamid Karzai goaded his people to riot over burned Korans by American soldiers, and Egyptian preacher Khaled Abdullah turned “Innocence of Muslims” into an international event. Any Westerner can now buy a Koran for a dollar and burn it, while any Muslim with a platform can transform that act into a fighting offense. As passions rise on both sides of the divide, Western provocateurs and Islamist hotheads have found each other, as confrontations occur with increasing frequency. Which prompts this question: What would happen if publishers and managers of major media outlets reached a consensus -- “Enough of this intimidation, we will publish the most famous Danish Muhammad cartoon every day, until the Islamists tire out and no longer riot”? What would happen if Korans were recurrently burned? Would repetition inspire institutionalization, generate ever-more outraged responses, and offer a vehicle for Islamists to ride to greater power? Or would it lead to routinization, to a wearing out of Islamists, and a realization that violence is counter-productive to their cause? I predict the latter. A Muhammad cartoon published each day, or Koranic desecrations on a quasi-regular basis, would make it harder for Islamists to mobilize Muslim mobs. Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions – freely, to criticize without fear. That would demonstrate to Islamists that Westerners will not capitulate, that they reject Islamic law, that they are ready to stand up for their values. So, this is my plea to all Western editors and producers: Display the Muhammad cartoon daily, until the Islamists become accustomed to the fact that we turn sacred cows into hamburger. Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how publishing cartoons of Muhammad and other actions that might be considered offensive to Islam have caused tensions and protests in the past.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base. I am facing a new situation today: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them.

As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.

The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them.

With nearly 400 people being identified, along with their email addresses, Facebook pages, and additional information, it has garnered much attention. Although this list from Anonymous doesn't include the previously promised 1,000 names or those of politicians, it does reveal a few retired law enforcement officers. The following article aims to delve deeper into this shadowy world and explore the context, implications, and potential fallout of this event. Anonymous and Operation KKK: Operation KKK is an initiative by Anonymous to combat and expose the KKK in response to a local Klan chapter threatening violence during protests in Ferguson. The list released on Thursday is the result of 11 months of intensive research and \\"digital espionage\\" using various tactics to unearth the alleged members of the hate group. According to Engadget, Anonymous managed to trick some people into admitting their KKK affiliation while chatting online. In the words of Operation KKK, \\"You never know who you are talking to on the internet.\\" This highlights the strategy and tactics used by Anonymous in revealing these individuals. The List: The list, although shorter than expected, is primarily composed of various alleged KKK members' personal information, minus any politicians mentioned in an earlier, widely discredited list. However, some retired law enforcement officers find themselves among those featured on Anonymous's exposé. These aspects of the list prompt further questions and investigations. One significant aspect of the list is the inclusion of popular online hangouts for KKK members, where they likely coordinate efforts and discuss their objectives. This serves as an additional insight into the world of the KKK, offering opportunities for further research and counteraction. Consequences and Reactions: Anonymous stands firm in its belief that releasing this list is a critical form of resistance against the hate group. The statement from Operation KKK reads, \\"We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.\\" While some names initially mentioned in the non-Anonymous list were found to be misleading, Operation KKK tweeted that several other names had been removed \\"for further investigation,\\" according to Raw Story. As a result, there might be potential updates to the list in the future. Initial reactions to the list have been mixed – some appreciate the efforts of Anonymous in unmasking the KKK members, while others criticize the public exposure of individuals, especially given the still unconfirmed status of some of the identities. The potential backlash against the named individuals, if found incorrect, could also have legal and social implications for Anonymous. Conclusion: Overall, the release of the alleged KKK members' list by Anonymous highlights the ongoing power struggle between hate groups and online activists. As Anonymous continues their efforts in combating the KKK through digital means, the evolving nature of online activism becomes all the more significant, with potentially far-reaching consequences in this digital age. It remains to be seen if this action will bring about positive change or further entrench the divisions and animosity between groups."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy.

Dan Thomas is still incredulous that Vanyo allegedly stole the 70-year old wedding ring right off his hand while he slept one night last month. “While I was asleep in bed,” Thomas said, incredulously. CLICK HERE to watch Carey Codd’s report Detectives say Vanyo lived in Thomas’ neighborhood and broke in through Thomas’ laundry room door. Thomas said he knew something was wrong when he woke up and looked around his home. “The two medicine cabinets in the bathroom were open,” Thomas said. “I never leave them open. That door to the washroom was open. I never leave that open.” BSO says Vanyo burglarized Thomas a few weeks before the August incident and also burglarized another sleeping neighbor. Thomas’ son, James, is glad his father, a decorated World War II veteran, was not hurt. He wants Vanyo to face a serious punishment. “I’m just happy they caught the guy,” James Thomas said. “I’d rather have him buried than in jail but as long as he’s in jail permanently, I’ll be happy. As long as he quits bothering other people.” Thomas got his ring back. He said it’s an ongoing reminder of his late wife. BSO says the pawn shop where Vanyo sold it made Thomas pay to recover it. For now, Thomas feels safe in his longtime home with a security system in place but he says he doesn’t have the freedom he once did. “Now I’m home in my house and I’m not free,” Thomas said. “I’m locked in.

Sent 2: On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. Sent 3: It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. Sent 4: The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. Sent 5: The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. Sent 6: At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. Sent 7: The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. Sent 8: With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Sent 9: Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. Sent 10: By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. Sent 11: The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Sent 12: Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. Sent 13: On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. Sent 14: The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Sent 15: Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Sent 16: Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. Sent 17: The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Sent 18: Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

(A) His brother wanted the throne (B) Discontent with Absolutist Rule (C) National bankruptcy and absolutist government (D) Because he betrayed the nation (E) Due to discontent with absolutist rule.","completion":"B, E"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will Jesse want to do next?\\", is \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" a valid answer? pick from the following. (a). Yes (b). No Answer:","completion":"(b). No Based on the context given in the scenario, Jesse and Jordan share a love for Harry Potter, and thus they decided to watch every showing of the \\"Half Blood Prince\\" when it was released. Their interest seems to be centred around Harry Potter and the endeavors associated with it, some of which could include discussing theories about the story, reading Harry Potter books, purchasing Harry Potter merchandise, visiting Harry Potter themed parks or exhibits, or even watching other movies from the Harry Potter franchise. Given this, it would be reasonable to presume that Jesse and Jordan's next activity would, in some way, include their mutual passion for Harry Potter. The question \\"What will Jesse want to do next?\\" naturally brings to mind something related to this common interest. On the other hand, \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" doesn’t appear to be a valid response to the question since there is no context suggesting that Jesse or Jordan have an interest in the musical Hamilton or, more broadly, in musical theater. Hamilton is a famous Broadway musical based on the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, and while it is immensely popular, it has no direct tie-in with Harry Potter. In short, provided no additional context or information about Jesse's interest in musicals or Hamilton specifically, the response \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" is less plausible.

Summarize this article: If you use a petite lace headband, you probably will not need to make any adjustments. If you use a standard-size lace headband, you might need to take it in. You can use a white headband, but you can also try to find one in a color that matches your dress or your school colors. A petite lace headband is the sort of headband worn by babies and toddlers. To take the headband in, clip apart and remove the ribbon holding it together. Turn the headband inside-out and fold one end of the lace down until the entire length matches the length the garter needs to be. Line up the fold with the other end and stitch them together using a triple stitch or narrow zigzag stitch. Turn the garter right-side-out again. Cut 10 inches (25 cm) of narrow tulle. Fold it together and attach your embellishment with glue. You should have about eight layers of folded tulle. Even at this thickness, the tulle will be light enough to prevent it from being seen at a distance. Put a small amount of hot glue in the middle of the tulle before firmly fixing your embellishment on the dot. Let dry. You could use fake pearls or gems for an embellishment, but for something more themed to homecoming, use a charm of your school mascot or school emblem. You could also attach a football jewelry charm or a small bow made with ribbon in your school colors. Hand stitch the tulle onto the center seam of the lace headband to complete your garter. Trim your tulle down before attaching it. Cut it near the embellishment, leaving just enough to sew into.","completion":"The article provides instructions for adjusting a lace headband to create a homecoming garter.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony? Passage 1:German Namibians () are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia. In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of Lüderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English. Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 – January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing. Passage 3:The Anita Kerr Singers or The Jordanaires sang background on just about every Nashville hit in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After she and Al Kerr divorced, she disbanded the Nashville version of her Anita Kerr Singers and relocated to Los Angeles in August 1965 with her second husband, Swiss businessman Alex Grob, and her daughters Suzie & Kelly. She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs – she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \\"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA’s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound. The Anita Kerr Singers won another Grammy Award for their recording of A Man And A Woman, released as a single on Warner Bros. Records.","completion":"To find the answer to the question \\"Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony?\\", we can use information from Passage 1.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where was the long sea voyage? The film tells a fictionalized version of the Pilgrims' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to North America aboard the Mayflower. During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones falls in love with Dorothy Bradford, the wife of William Bradford. The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion. Ship's carpenter John Alden -- said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620—catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins, one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford. Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish. Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \\"I'm going to be the first to see land.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

In New York City, a middle-aged black insurance salesman named Doyle Gipson is a recovering alcoholic who is attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to stay sober. On the same morning that Gipson drives to a hearing to try to regain custody of his children, a successful, white, young Wall Street attorney, Gavin Banek, is distracted while driving and collides his new Mercedes CLK320 with Gipson's older Toyota Corolla. Banek was in a rush to get to court to file a power of appointment document, which will prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. Gipson was also in a rush to get to a hearing to argue for joint custody of his sons with his estranged wife. Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a blank check, rather than exchanging insurance information, thereby disobeying the law. Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \\"do this right\\", but Banek, whose car is still drivable, insists upon leaving immediately. He leaves Gipson stranded, telling him, \\"better luck next time\\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that the judge ruled against him in his absence, giving sole custody of the boys to Gipson's wife and allowing her to proceed with a plan to move to Oregon, never knowing that Gipson was about to buy a house locally and give it to his wife and children as part of his effort to make joint custody workable for everyone.

Driven by greed, this conglomerate has polluted the environment through relentless industrialization, turning rivers and lakes into highly acidic pools. The citizens of New Haven, oppressed and desperate for change, are on the brink of rebellion. Reiss, a skilled mechanic and scientist in his late 20s, understands all too well the ever-present danger of life in New Haven. Orphaned at young age due to an \\"industrial accident\\" that claimed his parents, he vows to expose the truth behind Genesis Corp's atrocities and bring them down. With the help of a small group of rebels known as 'The Resistance,' Reiss uncovers a clandestine experiment being carried out by Genesis Corp: a dangerous new technology capable of transforming ordinary citizens into genetically enhanced, superhuman warriors called 'Super Soldiers.' Determined to stop Genesis Corp's sinister plan, Reiss infiltrates one of their research facilities to gather evidence. However, he is discovered and apprehended by Dr. Mirenzia, the mastermind behind the Super Soldier project. Intent on using Reiss as her next test subject, she subjects him to her latest experimental serum, hoping to create an even more powerful Super Soldier under her control. But something goes wrong during the procedure. Reiss' body rejects the serum, causing him to convulse and momentarily break free from his restraints. Amidst the chaos and confusion, Reiss lunges at Dr. Mirenzia, but she knocks him back into a large vat of the same acid responsible for his parents' demise. Witnessing his fall, the Resistance members fear the worst and are forced to retreat. Genesis Corp. remains in power, and hope seemingly dies with Reiss. However, Reiss' fate isn't quite sealed. During the time his body was marinating in the acidic pool, a new compound forms as a result of the harmonized reaction between the serum injected in him and the highly acidic environment, transforming him into something beyond human. He becomes an indestructible being, unaffected by the acid's harm and endowed with superhuman strength, agility, and a healing factor that resembles immortality. Emboldened by his newfound abilities and driven by rage, Reiss escapes the facility and joins the Resistance once again. However, this turn of events comes at a great cost: his once-human appearance is now replaced with a scarred, disfigured visage, a constant reminder of the sacrifices he has made. Together with the Resistance, he leads a full-scale revolt against Genesis Corp, determined to avenge his parents and protect the innocent citizens of New Haven. As the storyline unfolds, Reiss uncovers a shocking truth behind Genesis Corp., revealing connections to his own past that shakes him to the core. Conflicted and filled with doubt, he must now learn to accept and control his newfound abilities. Will his thirst for vengeance consume him, or will he evolve into the savior New Haven needs?

Spot often assists Hong Kong Phooey in solving cases and fighting criminals but prefers to let Hong Kong Phooey take all the credit. Throughout the show, the viewers can see that Hong Kong Phooey is quite clumsy and often gets into accidents and misadventures. In many instances, it is Spot's quick thinking and actions that save the day. To sum it up, the name of the cat in Hong Kong Phooey is Spot, and he plays a significant role in the adventures of the titular character. Despite his low-profile appearance, Spot is a crucial element in the show's crime-fighting dynamic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step-by-step justification: 1. The sentence talks about the rat taking fabric from the quilt to put it in the nest. This action directly affects the quilt and nest. 2. Since the rat is getting fabric from the quilt, the quilt will have less material as the fabric is being taken away from it. Therefore, option 1 is consistent with the action mentioned in the sentence. 3. Option 2 states that the nest has less material, which contradicts the sentence's information that fabric is being added to the nest. Hence, option 2 is incorrect.

What is the title of this article: The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen were not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government. Today the Bitumount plant is a Provincial Historic Site.","completion":"Title: \\"The Evolution of Bitumen Extraction and Uses: From Early Beginnings to the Bitumount Plant\\""},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo. - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion. - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring . - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987. - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle. - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource. - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers. - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971. - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981. - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was inaugurated in 1975 when Robert Heinlein was made the first SFWA Grand Master and it was renamed in 2002 after the Association's founder, Damon Knight, who had died that year.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. Before bringing your new pet home you need to decide if you intend the bunny to be a house rabbit or live outdoors in a run in the yard. House rabbits are popular pets but there are a few factors to consider. While you will have to do more cleaning and training for a rabbit that lives indoors with you, you will not have as much social contact with a rabbit that lives outside. If you decide to keep your rabbit inside, you will need to rabbit-proof your house. Rabbits chew anything and everything, including electrical cables and the legs of your antique furniture. Make sure you are able to 'rabbit proof' your home so that cables are all tidied away out of reach of the rabbit, and there is no item that you would be upset if it got damaged by gnawing. If you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will also need to litter box train it. It is not hygienic to have the rabbit ranging around the house, pooping and peeing wherever they please. The solution is to litter train the rabbit to use a litter box. However, most rabbits poop mostly in one particular spot, so you can use this to your advantage by placing a litter tray in whichever spot they usually poop. If you have a male rabbit who is spraying urine everywhere, you may need to get him desexed. If you decide to keep your rabbit outside you will need to commit to spending time socializing it every day. Make it a part of your schedule, otherwise the rabbit may become anxious and fearful in your company. The hutch (or rabbit house) should be at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wide and 4 feet long, and tall enough to let the rabbit stand up to its full height. The bottom of the cage should not be made of wire, but the sides can be. Outdoor hutches are most commonly made of wood with a door fitted at the front made of chicken wire. This allows for good ventilation and for the rabbit to see out. The wood offers a degree of thermal protection to insulate the rabbit from the elements, and is sturdy, protecting the rabbit from predators. An outdoor hutch will need to have a run attached to it, so that your rabbit can exercise. The run should be a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 ft by 2ft tall, for a rabbit under 2kg. Many indoor hutches are made of plastic with a wire roof. This has the advantage of being lightweight, so you can move it around the house easily. If you can't find a hutch you like, make your own! It isn't as simple as buying one, but it can be much better for your rabbit. You must provide bedding that is soft, warm and absorbent. Cover the entire base to a minimum depth of 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm). This cushions the backs of the rabbit's hind legs, which are prone to pressure sores if not enough padding is provided. Commonly used substrates for bedding include wood chips, hay, or straw. Of these, straw is the warmest and softest and makes the best bedding material, hay is second best (and is more expensive than straw), and sawdust it third best. You will need to litter train your rabbit if you are keeping it inside. The litter tray will need to fit inside the hutch and not take up more than a third of the floor space.

When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water.\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water\\" is not true according to the passage. As mentioned in the article, wave energy actually comes from the wind.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"These two questions are not the same, but they examine the actions and impacts of two different U.S. Presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, with a focus on the African American community. I will address each question separately for a comprehensive understanding. 1. What has Barack Obama done that gets so many people angry? It is important to bear in mind that Presidents often draw both admiration and criticism for their policies and actions. While Barack Obama achieved numerous accomplishments while in office, there were several areas where people have expressed discontent or anger: a) Healthcare - The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare,\\" was one of Obama's most significant and controversial legislative achievements. While it aimed to expand health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, critics argue that it led to increased premiums, limited choices, and infringed on individual liberties due to the individual mandate. b) Economic Policies - The Obama administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis included a 787 billion stimulus package that sparked criticism from those who believed it was wasteful, ineffective, or excessive government intervention. Additionally, some people argue that his administration’s regulation-heavy approach stifled economic growth and job creation. c) Immigration - Some critics took issue with Obama's executive orders on immigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA). These policies were seen by some as either too lenient or an overreach of executive authority. d) Foreign Policy - Critics of Obama’s foreign policy argue that his approach to global issues, including the Iran Nuclear Deal, the handling of the Syrian Civil War, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, left the United States and its allies more vulnerable. The administration's use of drone strikes in the Middle East, which caused civilian casualties, also generated anger. e) Partisanship - Obama's presidency exacerbated political polarization in the country, exacerbated by factors such as increasing racial tensions and the rise of the Tea Party movement. This polarization contributed to an atmosphere of anger and frustration for many Americans during his tenure. 2. Did Bill Clinton do more for black people than Barack Obama? This question is subjective and depends on the specific policies and actions one chooses to examine when comparing the two presidents. Here are some key points for consideration: a) Bill Clinton: - Introduced empowerment zones and enterprise communities, which aimed to improve economic opportunities in distressed urban and rural areas, including many African-American communities. - Increased funding for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) during his tenure. - Welfare reform, which some argue reduced the dependency on government assistance, but has also faced criticism for disproportionately impacting disadvantaged black Americans by tightening eligibility rules and reducing benefits. - Enacted the 1994 Crime Bill, which has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration and disproportionately affecting African Americans. Later in his life, Clinton acknowledged some of the negative consequences of the bill. b) Barack Obama: - Implemented the Affordable Care Act, which increased healthcare coverage for many African Americans. - Launched My Brother's Keeper, an initiative dedicated to addressing the opportunity gaps faced by young men of color, including African Americans. - Supported criminal justice reforms, including reducing sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses, a policy that had disproportionate consequences for the black community. - Strengthened anti-discrimination laws in areas such as housing, employment, and voting rights, which often disproportionately affected African Americans. Ultimately, the assessment of who did more for the African American community depends on one's perspective on these policy actions and their impact. However, both Clinton and Obama spearheaded numerous initiatives that attempted to improve opportunities for black Americans in different ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? I. no; II. yes;","completion":"I. no First, let's discuss each question and topic separately. 1. Is Swathi's murder taking a casteist turn? Swathi's murder is a tragic and unfortunate event that gained significant attention in the media and among the public. Speculation over whether or not the motives behind her murder were casteist, mainly fueled by the aggressive nature of the crime, the suspects involved, and the subsequent investigations. However, it would be important to base any conclusion regarding caste-based involvement on credible evidence and not hearsay or unverified claims. Discussing a sensitive issue like caste requires objectivity and an understanding of the socio-cultural factors influencing discrimination in society. Taking any stand without substantial evidence may not only create a bias but may also trivialize the victim's plight. 2. Why would J.K. Rowling allow fanfiction (Cursed Child) as canon? J.K. Rowling's decision to consider the Cursed Child as canon can be attributed to multiple reasons. Firstly, the Cursed Child was written in collaboration with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, both well-respected playwrights and writers. Rowling's endorsement and involvement in the project lend credibility and, to a certain extent, the acceptance of the story as part of the Harry Potter series. Secondly, accepting fanfiction as canon helps keep the story universe alive and growing. A dystopian tale like Harry Potter has generated a massive following, with numerous fans wanting to explore new storylines, characters, and situations, which amplifies their interest in the series. By allowing fanfiction as canon, Rowling embraces the creativity and engagement of the fan community. Lastly, the Cursed Child provides a sense of closure to many fans eager to know what happens in the life of the beloved characters after the conclusion of the original book series. It allows fans to continue their journey in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Now to address the multi-choice problem: These two questions are distinctly different in subject matter and context. Swathi's murder and the investigation into its possible casteist aspects is a real-life crime issue that raises concerns about social and cultural prejudices that persist within society. On the other hand, the discussion about J.K. Rowling allowing fanfiction to be considered canon pertains to literary works and the Harry Potter series, delving into the author's rationale and the impact on the fan base. Therefore, I would choose option I. (No) as these two questions tackle separate issues and concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

For the premise to entail this hypothesis, there must be evidence or context that directly links the two statements. However, we are not provided with any such context or information in the given scenario. Given this lack of context and specificity, it is not possible to determine if the premise directly leads to or entails the hypothesis.

The hearing will likely take place in July, according to David Smith, spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners. Depending on the outcome, the “Juice” could be loose as soon as Oct. 1. Previous ratings of Simpson have scored him in the low-risk category for release. Simpson — who was famously acquitted in 1995 in the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman — has been serving out a nine-to-33-year sentence for his role in a 2007 incident that unfolded in a Las Vegas hotel room. He and armed associates allegedly confronted memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley and took pieces of Simpson’s memorabilia from them. Simpson was convicted on charges including kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. The former college and pro football star said at his sentencing that he was trying to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been stolen from him, and claimed that he was unaware his associates were carrying guns. Simpson’s lawyers in the Nevada case argued that the crime did not justify the time. They said that Simpson, 69, was getting a dose of payback from the Nevada justice system after his acquittal in the Brown and Goldman murders. Simpson has always denied that he was their killer, though the Brown and Goldman families won a wrongful death civil judgment against him in 1997. Since 2008, Simpson has been at Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in a remote desert town of the same name. This summer, Nevada prison inmate #1027820 will have his first chance at freedom. It comes at a time when Simpson has vaulted back into the limelight with the documentary “O.J.: Made in America,” which captured the Academy Award for best documentary. Ron Goldman’s father, Fred, told CNN he is not surprised Simpson may be released from prison in October. “Simpson has proven over and over again, throughout his life, he has absolutely no concern for the law or authority,” Goldman said. Simpson’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. At least four of seven commissioners will have to vote in Simpson’s favor in order for him to be released. Here’s how they will make their decision. How Simpson could get parole With a minimum sentence of nine years, this is the first year Simpson could be released. But he was granted parole on some of the counts against him at a 2013 hearing. This summer, he will only have to make parole on seven of the original 12 counts. Prosecutors declined to comment on the likelihood of Simpson being paroled. Simpson’s prosecution in the deaths and civil suit loss will have no impact on his bid for parole, said Smith, the parole board spokesman. The parole board scores an inmate on several factors — the higher the total score, the greater the risk involved in releasing them. A person with a score of zero to five points is deemed low risk; six to 11 points, medium risk; and 12 or more, high risk. In 2013, Simpson scored three points overall. Little has changed for him since then, and he is likely to score similarly when he goes before the board again this summer. In his favor: He will turn 70 years old in July, and people above the age of 41 are considered less likely to commit a crime (-1 point). Simpson was above the age of 24 at the time of his first arrest; he has never had parole or probation revoked; he is retired and is believed to have no gang ties; he is a medium custody inmate (all 0 points). In 2013, he had no record of disciplinary action over the year before the hearing, earning him -1 point. Simpson has maintained a pattern of good behavior and is likely to have the same score again this summer. Completing an educational, vocational or treatment program would also help him. Simpson scored zero in this category in 2013, but testified then that he was on the waiting list to get into a “commitment to change” program. If he got in, he will likely score -1 point this year. Another factor in Simpson’s favor — one that no doubt enrages the Brown and Goldman families — is the fact that his risk assessment states “no prior conviction history.” Working against him: He has a property crime conviction in the 2007 incident (2 points). In the “drug/alcohol use/abuse” category, Simpson’s 2013 parole documents cite a history of “frequent abuse, serious disruption of functioning.” (2 points) As men are statistically more likely than women to commit crimes, he also scores one point for his gender. The severity of the crime is another factor for the commissioners to consider, outside of the risk assessment score sheet. Simpson received the highest level of offense severity for his kidnapping conviction in the hotel raid, during which the memorabilia dealers said they feared leaving the hotel room under threat from Simpson’s gun-wielding associates. The “substantial financial loss” one of the memorabilia dealers incurred was also cited in 2013 as a factor that made Simpson’s crime more serious. ‘A model prisoner’ If Simpson does score as low risk in 2017, the board still has the latitude to deny him parole. Should that happen, Simpson would go before the parole board again before 2020, Smith said. But Simpson fits the profile of a state prison inmate who receives parole at the first opportunity, Nevada defense attorney Dan Hill said. “Simpson’s age, the fact that he was given parole on the first sentencing batch, weigh in his favor,” Hill said. “So does the fact that he was by all accounts a model prisoner, as does any acceptance of responsibility for his actions.” In a video of the 2013 hearing, Simpson pleads with the parole commissioners. “My crime was trying to retrieve for my family my own property that was stolen from me,” Simpson tells the panel. “I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said keep it and not worry about it.” Simpson tells the board that he helps supervise in the prison gym, disinfects equipment, mops floors, coaches and umpires games. “Because of I guess my age, guys come to me,” Simpson says. “I’m sure the powers here know that I advise a lot of guys. I’d like to feel I kept a lot of trouble from happening. Since I’ve been here by getting involved in some of the conflicts that some of the individuals here have had.” The old-fashioned principle of remorse Members of the parole board “work with the old-fashioned principal of wanting to hear the inmate is remorseful for their crime,” said Gabe Grasso, a veteran Nevada defense attorney who was part of the team representing Simpson in the Las Vegas kidnapping case. Grasso, who stopped representing the former star running back eight years ago, has seen dozens of former clients go before the parole board. “What O.J. has going for him is I don’t think Fromong will want to show up screaming and testifying against him,” the lawyer added. “He was upset, insulted, but I don’t think that he thought the price should be what it was.” Fromong told CNN that he would testify in favor of Simpson’s release. “I told the district attorney at the time (of his conviction) that I only thought that O.J. Simpson deserved one to three years in state prison,” Fromong said. “O.J.’s done his time, he’s been a model inmate,” he said. The other victim, Alfred Beardsley, died in 2015. “Something else that could help O.J., he did not set up the meeting in the hotel room,” Grasso added. Tom Riccio, a Los Angeles man who had been convicted on stolen property charges before the 2007 incident, arranged the meeting between Simpson and the memorabilia dealers. “I hope he does get his life together,” Riccio told CNN. “I hope he doesn’t take matters into his own hands anymore. I hope he has learned his lesson.” “He was just trying to get his stuff back,” Riccio said. “A lot of memorabilia but also a lot of personal items, mementos. I don’t think a regular person would get nine to 33 years for these crimes. They were getting him for other things.” ||||| (CNN) O.J. Simpson could get out of prison later this year, if a pivotal parole hearing goes his way. The hearing will likely take place in July, according to David Smith, spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners. Depending on the outcome, the \\"Juice\\" could be loose as soon as October 1. Previous ratings of Simpson have scored him in the low-risk category for release. Simpson -- who was famously acquitted in 1995 in the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman -- has been serving out a nine-to-33-year sentence for his role in a 2007 incident that unfolded in a Las Vegas hotel room. He and armed associates allegedly confronted memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley and took pieces of Simpson's memorabilia from them. Simpson was convicted on charges including kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. The former college and pro football star said at his sentencing that he was trying to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been stolen from him, and claimed that he was unaware his associates were carrying guns. O.J. Simpson, 68, in a corrections photo released in 2016. Simpson's lawyers in the Nevada case argued that the crime did not justify the time. They said that Simpson, 69, was getting a dose of payback from the Nevada justice system after his acquittal in the Brown and Goldman murders. Simpson has always denied that he was their killer, though the Brown and Goldman families won a wrongful death civil judgment against him in 1997. Since 2008, Simpson has been at Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in a remote desert town of the same name. This summer, Nevada prison inmate #1027820 will have his first chance at freedom. It comes at a time when Simpson has vaulted back into the limelight with the documentary \\"O.J.: Made in America,\\" which captured the Academy Award for best documentary. Ron Goldman's father, Fred, told CNN he is not surprised Simpson may be released from prison in October. \\"Simpson has proven over and over again, throughout his life, he has absolutely no concern for the law or authority,\\" Goldman said. A hallway inside Lovelock Correctional Center. Simpson's attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. At least four of seven commissioners will have to vote in Simpson's favor in order for him to be released. Here's how they will make their decision. How Simpson could get parole With a minimum sentence of nine years, this is the first year Simpson could be released. But he was granted parole on some of the counts against him at a 2013 hearing. This summer, he will only have to make parole on seven of the original 12 counts. Prosecutors declined to comment on the likelihood of Simpson being paroled. Simpson's prosecution in the deaths and civil suit loss will have no impact on his bid for parole, said Smith, the parole board spokesman. The parole board scores an inmate on several factors -- the higher the total score, the greater the risk involved in releasing them. A person with a score of zero to five points is deemed low risk; six to 11 points, medium risk; and 12 or more, high risk. In 2013, Simpson scored three points overall. Little has changed for him since then, and he is likely to score similarly when he goes before the board again this summer. Photos: O.J. Simpson trial: Where are they now?

Simpson was above the age of 24 at the time of his first arrest; he has never had parole or probation revoked; he is retired and is believed to have no gang ties; he is a medium custody inmate (all 0 points). In 2013, he had no record of disciplinary action over the year before the hearing, earning him -1 point. Simpson has maintained a pattern of good behavior and is likely to have the same score again this summer. Completing an educational, vocational or treatment program would also help him. Simpson scored zero in this category in 2013, but testified then that he was on the waiting list to get into a \\"commitment to change\\" program. If he got in, he will likely score -1 point this year. Another factor in Simpson's favor -- one that no doubt enrages the Brown and Goldman families -- is the fact that his risk assessment states \\"no prior conviction history.\\" Working against him: He has a property crime conviction in the 2007 incident (2 points). In the \\"drug/alcohol use/abuse\\" category, Simpson's 2013 parole documents cite a history of \\"frequent abuse, serious disruption of functioning.\\" (2 points) As men are statistically more likely than women to commit crimes, he also scores one point for his gender. The severity of the crime is another factor for the commissioners to consider, outside of the risk assessment score sheet. Simpson received the highest level of offense severity for his kidnapping conviction in the hotel raid, during which the memorabilia dealers said they feared leaving the hotel room under threat from Simpson's gun-wielding associates. The \\"substantial financial loss\\" one of the memorabilia dealers incurred was also cited in 2013 as a factor that made Simpson's crime more serious. 'A model prisoner' If Simpson does score as low risk in 2017, the board still has the latitude to deny him parole. Should that happen, Simpson would go before the parole board again before 2020, Smith said. But Simpson fits the profile of a state prison inmate who receives parole at the first opportunity, Nevada defense attorney Dan Hill said. \\"Simpson's age, the fact that he was given parole on the first sentencing batch, weigh in his favor,\\" Hill said. \\"So does the fact that he was by all accounts a model prisoner, as does any acceptance of responsibility for his actions.\\" In a video of the 2013 hearing, Simpson pleads with the parole commissioners. \\"My crime was trying to retrieve for my family my own property that was stolen from me,\\" Simpson tells the panel. \\"I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said keep it and not worry about it.\\" Simpson tells the board that he helps supervise in the prison gym, disinfects equipment, mops floors, coaches and umpires games. \\"Because of I guess my age, guys come to me,\\" Simpson says. \\"I'm sure the powers here know that I advise a lot of guys. I'd like to feel I kept a lot of trouble from happening. Since I've been here by getting involved in some of the conflicts that some of the individuals here have had.\\" JUST WATCHED O.J.

Grasso, who stopped representing the former star running back eight years ago, has seen dozens of former clients go before the parole board. \\"What O.J. has going for him is I don't think Fromong will want to show up screaming and testifying against him,\\" the lawyer added. \\"He was upset, insulted, but I don't think that he thought the price should be what it was.\\" Fromong told CNN that he would testify in favor of Simpson's release. \\"I told the district attorney at the time (of his conviction) that I only thought that O.J. Simpson deserved one to three years in state prison,\\" Fromong said. \\"O.J.'s done his time, he's been a model inmate,\\" he said.

Plot title: The North Avenue Irregulars Movie plot: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Five women from his congregation (and Delany, whose wife does not drive) attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness.

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _ \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Steve used to be bad at his lessons because _ . A) the teacher blamed him from time to time B) he was not a smart boy in his class C) the test for the seventh grade challenged his confidence D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies Answer:","completion":"D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies In the given context, it becomes clear that Steve's struggle with his lessons wasn't due to a lack of intelligence or his teacher's blame. In fact, Miss White declares Steve as the smartest boy in the seventh grade despite his poor performance. The real issue lies in Steve's lack of interest and dedication to his studies. Instead of focusing on school, he daydreams about the woods and doesn't engage with his coursework. This disinterest is demonstrated by his refusal to do homework, even as the punishments become more severe. Steve's turning point comes when Miss White shows genuine concern and care for his future. This unexpected expression of compassion makes him realize that he is not alone, and that there is value in putting effort into his schoolwork. After this, Steve makes a conscious decision to dedicate time and effort to his studies by taking his schoolbooks with him when he spends time in the woods. Upon his return to school, he arrives on time and eagerly completes a quiz on the weekend homework. Miss White is both shocked and proud to see that Steve has passed his first test, indicating that he has finally put his heart into his studies. As a result, Steve's academic performance rapidly improves, and he discovers that he enjoys learning and excelling at school. In conclusion, the primary reason Steve used to be bad at his lessons was that he hadn't put his heart into his studies. It wasn't until he received genuine support and encouragement from Miss White that he became motivated to dedicate himself to school, which clearly demonstrated his true potential as the smartest boy in the seventh grade."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Feed your frog insects every two or three days. Provide a water dish. Spray the terrarium to increase humidity.","completion":"Title: Effective Techniques for Maintaining Frog Health through Optimal Terrarium Conditions and Feeding Step One: Understanding the Topic The summary provided indicates that the article will gravitate around how to maintain a frog's health through appropriate insect-feeding schedules, water provision, and terrarium humidity conditions. To begin with, I will provide some background information on the importance of each element before delving into the specifics of practical application. Final Introduction: Frogs are intriguing animals boasting of unique features and behavior; understanding and catering to their needs results in a thriving and healthy pet. Proper caring involves various factors spanning their diet, hydration, and habitat. This article provides pointers on how to gut-load crickets for feeding, how often to feed your frog insects, the significance of a water dish, and the importance of optimum terrarium humidity. Step Two: Writing About the Importance of Gut-loading Crickets As a first step in the discussion, I will explain what gut-loading is and the benefits it brings to a frog's health. Gut-loading refers to the process of feeding nutritious food to crickets before offering them to frogs. It is important because frogs gain their nutrients mainly from what the insects have consumed. Final Paragraph: Gut-Loading Your Crickets: Enhancing Frog Nutrition Gut-loading is a strategic method of ensuring your frog gets the necessary vitamins and minerals. This process involves feeding crickets with nutrient-rich food before serving them as meals to frogs. Since frogs mainly acquire nutrients from what their prey consumes, gut-loading essentially enhances the nutritional value of their diet. Step Three: Discussing the Frequency of Insect Feeding to Frogs The summary provides a frequency of every two or three days, but it's important to give more context. The feeding frequency varies depending on the frog's size, age, and species. Final Paragraph: The Regularity of Feeding Insects to Frogs: Striking a Healthy Balance Feeding your pet frog insects every two or three days is a general guideline but might change depending on the frog's characteristics. The size, age, and species of a frog can dictate the frequency. For example, younger frogs usually require daily feeding, while some larger species may only need feeding every few days. However, a balance of nutrients is crucial to enhancing a frog's longevity and health. Step Four: Discussing the Importance of Providing a Water Dish Frogs require water both for drinking and maintaining their skin moisture. I will elaborate on the kind of water dish and water type suitable for frogs. Final Paragraph: Considerations in Providing a Water Dish: Essential Hydration for Frogs Having a water dish in the terrarium is essential. Frogs depend on water not only for drinking but also for keeping their skin moist. It is important to choose a shallow dish that is easily accessible, and remember to fill it with dechlorinated water, as frogs are particularly sensitive to chlorine and other chemicals. Step Five: Writing About the Need for Spraying the Terrarium Frogs need a certain level of moisture in the air to stay healthy, and this varies by species. Spraying replicates this humidity. Final Paragraph: Spraying the Terrarium: Ensuring Optimum Humidity Humidity plays a crucial role in a frog's wellbeing. Frogs require a specific humidity level in their atmosphere depending on their species. Spraying the terrarium with water regularly can mimic their natural habitat's wet conditions and help maintain a lush, humid environment that frogs enjoy. In conclusion, caring for frogs is a meticulous process that involves attention to their diet, hydration, and habitat conditions. By adhering to these guidelines, frog owners can take great strides in enhancing their pet's health and happiness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer to the question: Who did Santa Anna demand the executions of? is inside the article: The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., can you guess it ?

Their next full-length album was Good Mourning, released in 2003, with the album's launch single \\"We've Had Enough\\" seeing much the same success as the previous single \\"Stupid Kid\\". The album was something of a departure from earlier works, featuring greater production values. The band appeared on various compilation albums, notably Plea for Peace Vol. 1, Vagrant Records: Another Year on the Streets Vol. 1, 2, and 3, and Rock Against Bush Vol. 1. Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have both independently recorded split records, Skiba with Kevin Seconds on Asian Man Records and Andriano with Mike Felumlee on Double Zero Records, as well as jointly performing backing vocal duties on the album This is Unity Music by Common Rider. They recorded two split EPs: one with Hot Water Music in 2002 and the other with One Man Army in 2004. In 2004, Andriano became a member of The Falcon, a group consisting of The Lawrence Arms' bassist Brendan Kelly, previously of Slapstick (alongside Andriano) and The Broadways, and drummer Neil Hennessy. The Falcon also saw contributions from Todd Mohney of The Killing Tree and formerly Rise Against. The band released an EP, God Don't Make No Trash / Up Your Ass With Broken Glass in 2005 and its first full length, Unicornography in September 2006. Question: Did any more singles make it to the chart from that album? Answer:","completion":"From the album Good Mourning released in 2003, in addition to the launch single \\"We've Had Enough\\" which garnered significant success, the other single that gained some traction was \\"All on Black.\\" However, it did not achieve the same level of chart success as \\"We've Had Enough\\" or \\"Stupid Kid\\" from their previous album, From Here To Infirmary. Nonetheless, Good Mourning as an album contributed to further establishing Alkaline Trio's presence in the punk rock scene and helped expand their fan base."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact. 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry with the 7th Infantry Division participated in Exercise Reforger in 1984, 1986 and 1993. 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry was activated in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, in 1977. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army has had a long and storied history dating back to its formation in 1866. One notable period in the unit's history occurred during the Cold War, specifically as a part of the 4th Infantry Division. During this time, the 1st Squadron participated in several iterations of Exercise Reforger from 1977 to 1991 (Reforger stands for REturn of FORces to GERmany). Exercise Reforger was an annually held military exercise conducted by NATO to ensure its ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact, which was the main rival of NATO during the Cold War period. Throughout the various Exercise Reforger events, the 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry acted in numerous capacities as dictated by the objectives of each exercise. These tasks could range from engaging in reconnaissance and security operations to practicing defensive tactics in hypothetical conflict scenarios. By participating in these exercises, the squadron demonstrated its readiness and ability to rapidly deploy to West Germany and collaborate with other NATO forces. The 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, which belonged to the 7th Infantry Division, also held various participation in Exercise Reforger. They took part in the exercises in 1984, 1986, and 1993, which further attests to the importance of maintaining strong and agile forces during the Cold War. Similarly, the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry was activated within the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, in 1977. The 3rd Battalion contributed to this preparedness as well, although it did not participate in the Reforger exercises mentioned. Exercise Reforger ultimately served to showcase the strong and cohesive nature of NATO forces as they rehearsed various operational scenarios in the European theatre. The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, as well as other army units such as the 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry, and the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry, all played a significant role in exemplifying the dedication and readiness of U.S. military forces during the Cold War era, ultimately working to maintain peace and stability throughout the NATO alliance.

Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \\"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \\"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\\" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University.

The company said it will donate 30,000 to assist with the girl's medical bills. \\"The entire KFC family is behind Victoria,\\" company spokesman Rick Maynard said. 'Her face is disrupting our customers' Victoria Wilcher was mauled by three pit bulls a few months ago, causing her to need regular medical treatment.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: \\"Congratulations, Mr. Jones, it's a girl.\\" Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different answer from every man who hears these words. Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household.

Follow the Prediction Markets How would commentary on the midterm election look if economists, rather than Beltway pundits, were calling the race? You would read a lot less about personalities, gaffes and gossip, and a lot more about fundamentals like the state of the economy. And you would certainly get a more sophisticated reading of polls and political prediction markets. Let’s start with the fundamentals, which shape what is possible. Given the near certainty that control of the House of Representatives won’t change, I’ll focus on the Senate, where Republicans need to pick up six extra seats to take control. There’s a lot of upside for Republicans in this election cycle, and very little downside, as eight Democrats are defending winning margins from the last election of 10 points or less. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is the only Republican in this perilous position. In addition, midterm elections typically spell bad news for the party in control of the White House. Ever since World War II, the president’s party has, on average, lost a net four Senate seats in midterm races. Incumbency also matters, and careful studies suggest that senators running for re-election effectively begin with a head start of 8 to 10 percentage points. As a result, around 90 percent of incumbent senators are re-elected. Turnover is much more likely in open seats, and the Democrats find themselves defending five seats previously occupied by retiring Democrats, three of which are in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. And while three Republican senators are retiring, they are all in Republican-leaning states. These fundamentals add up to a powerful structural advantage for Senate Republicans. They also yield the sort of predictive power that economists often only dream about. But to a pundit, they may present a quandary: The broad contours of the election were largely set in stone nearly two years ago, yet column inches still need to be filled for a narrative-hungry readership. No surprise, then, that the supply of dramatic political narrative rises to meet the demand, and the commentariat largely ignores the underlying predictability of most elections. The one fundamental force that has changed over the past two years — sharply — is the state of the economy. This should be a major positive for Democrats, as improving economic conditions generally lead to better results for the president’s party. Even as the unemployment rate remains somewhat elevated, it has fallen by more during this two-year congressional term than in any previous midterm election cycle in the postwar era. Indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen exactly 4.1 percentage points since its double-digit recessionary peak, which exactly matches the peak-to-trough decline that Ronald Reagan presided over at a similar point in his presidency. In many respects, the economy remains in bad shape. Yet this is beside the point, as voters tend to respond to changes in economic conditions — the extent to which the economy has improved — rather than its current level. This distinction helps explain how President Obama won re-election in 2012, in the face of a very weak (though rapidly improving) economy. To be sure, there’s debate about how much the economy has improved. Even as unemployment has fallen, the proportion of the population with a job has barely risen, gross domestic product is merely puttering along, and wages are barely rising for most workers. Of course, these economic fundamentals matter only to the extent that they affect voters, which raises the question of how best to make sense of polls. The basic rules for interpreting economic statistics also apply to polling data: Big samples beat small samples, and a dashboard of indicators is more convincing than any single survey, which is why it’s important to aggregate information from many pollsters. Importantly, campaign events often drive sharp shifts in sentiment, although these effects are typically short-lived. A result is that polls often fluctuate wildly even as electoral fortunes evolve slowly. But as Election Day approaches, polls tend to shift toward the fundamentals, as economic and political realities come into sharper focus. There’s no point being steered in the wrong direction by polls that will later reverse themselves, which is why careful poll analysis — like that used by The Upshot’s model, which we’ve nicknamed Leo — filters polling data through a lens that takes account of the underlying fundamentals. By now, Leo suggests that the Republicans have a 66 percent chance of taking control of the Senate. While Leo and other poll-aggregation models are built to reflect the results of surveys asking people whom they intend to vote for, my research with David Rothschild of Microsoft Research suggests that asking people who they think will win typically yields even more accurate forecasts. A recent survey by Gallup (where, full disclosure, I do consulting as a senior scientist) found that 52 percent of people expect Republicans to win control of the Senate, compared with 42 percent who expect the Democrats to win. While a majority expect a Republican victory, the differential is smaller than that seen in the Obama-versus-Romney race, suggesting only a modest Republican edge. How should you combine insights from the basic political factors — the state of the economy, opinion polls and voter expectations? Economics doesn’t provide a formula, but rather a suggestion: Turn to political prediction markets where people trade securities linked to election outcomes. When many people make trades based on their individual perspectives, the price comes to reflect each of the most relevant factors, effectively weighting each by the confidence that traders have in them. While the Intrade market, once popular, is no longer with us, the idea lives on at Betfair, a prediction market run in Britain. As I’m writing, you can buy a security, which pays 100 if the Republicans take control of the Senate, at a discount: The security is going for around 69, which suggests a 69 percent chance that this will happen. Offshore bookmakers are offering similar odds. Even though markets are prone to their own failures, they have amassed a better record of accuracy than even the most sophisticated models that are based on fundamentals and polling. The point is that while markets aren’t perfect, in practice they’re less imperfect than the other election forecasters. This economist’s bottom line, then, is that there’s a 69 percent chance that Republicans will win the Senate. This forecast is clear, it’s precise, it’s quantitative (in that it acknowledges and specifies uncertainty), and it’s easily evaluated. In other words, it’s terrible punditry, but good economics. And, if you think it’s wrong, you can bet against it.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision? Sam Roffe, President of Roffe & Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company. Lead investigator Max Hornung informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams, but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe & Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's by-laws prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision. After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on snuff films using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat). Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, \\"Now try to make it look like an accident!\\" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols, both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film.","completion":"The first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision is Elizabeth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage.","completion":"The article entitled \\"The Top Eight Energy Risks For 2013\\" outlines eight major challenges, risks and uncertainties that the global energy sector faced in 2013. 1. MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles: The article stated that political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) posed a substantial risk to energy prices and supplies. The instability due to secession struggles in the Arab Nationalist Republics and Gulf Monarchies could lead to supply disruptions and sharp price increases. 2. Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices: This pointed to the potential for oil producer states to react poorly to falling oil prices, possibly employing repression to maintain control. Unstable global economic factors were likely to push oil prices down, shaking the economic stability of these states and potentially causing them to make difficult trade-offs. 3. Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head: The article discussed how Iran's unresolved nuclear issue could affect energy markets, facing significant sanctions and pressure during its presidential elections. However, any drastic change regarding this matter was unlikely to happen in 2013. 4. Russia Goes To Internal Energy War: There was a risk in 2013 that internal battles between Russian energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom could affect energy production. 5. American Schizophrenia Sets In: The article discussed the potential for mixed consequences due to America's success with shale gas. While it created a buyer's market for gas and held potential for higher export numbers, the risk of an oversaturated market and falling prices lingered. Additionally, the quest for energy independence could affect international oil prices and dynamics. 6. Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind: The sixth risk referred to geopolitical power vacuums, especially in the Middle East, that could pose substantial challenges to the global energy market. It pointed out a potential for conflict between the US and China, both of which were dependent on OPEC's oil. The article did not explicitly enumerate the 7th and 8th risks, but it can be inferred that these risks involved intricacies of international politics, market fluctuations, price indexes and the challenging dynamics between supplier states, consumer states and geopolitical power-blocs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Local theatres, cinemas, schools and function rooms are open to be rented. However, once you find it talk to the manager to make sure it's within their rules to hold a live event. Your best bet is to use a theatre, as many theatres have the option of holding a seated or standing gig and already have a PA system and stage installed; this cuts costs. There are also an increasing number of pubs dedicated to live music, these are generally around 100-300 capacity and should also have sound engineers on their books and an in-house PA. This last point is vital, if this is your first time putting on a gig, having an in-house PA not only cuts costs but means that A) this is a venue where people come often enough to warrant an in-house PA, B) the system should be set up to work with the room making your sound engineers job easier, and C) this will greatly reduce the amount of time and hassle before/after the gig as there is one less thing for you to sort out and there will only be a minimal amount of gear going in/ coming out of the venue. (sometimes venues want a cut of the ticket sales instead, don't let them have more than 40% as that's already far too much if you have extra costs) When it's a standing gig, you can usually have a larger capacity and the public often prefer standing gigs as you can dance and mosh if it's a metal gig. People usually prefer general admission because everyone has a shot at front row for the same price. However, a seated, assigned seat gig requires less security and less hassle for you. Theatres and venues often have door staff employed, but you may need to pay extra for their services. If this is a very localized gig with few people you may be able to get some of your larger, more confident friends to do security at it. However, laws often require that you get professional security staff. Add this cost to your budget If the venue has a bar, decide whether it will be distributing alcohol or not. If it is, it must be an over-age event. Alcohol being sold may increase your insurance costs. Public Liability Insurance (PLI) may be included with the venue, but always check. 200 bucks for insurance for the night is better than a million-dollar lawsuit. All insurance companies have an option for PLI, but shop around for the best price. Also, with each gig you organize, as long as there are no accidents, the cost of your insurance will go down because you have proved you're responsible and there is less risk. Add the cost of insurance to your budget.

Problem: a sum of money at simple interest amounts to rs . 815 in 3 years and to rs . 878 in 4 years . the sum is : Options: a ) 500 , b ) 698 , c ) 626 , d ) 910 , e ) none A:","completion":"To answer the given multiple-choice question, let's first understand the relationship between the sum, interest, and the amount. We are given that a sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 815 in 3 years and Rs. 878 in 4 years. Let's denote the principal amount (the sum) as P, the interest rate as R, and the time period t in years. The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * t) / 100 We can modify this formula to calculate the amount (A) at the end of the time period: A = P + SI = P + (P * R * t) / 100 We have two cases here: when t = 3 and t = 4. Case 1: t = 3, Amount (A) is Rs. 815 815 = P + (P * R * 3) / 100 Case 2: t = 4, Amount (A) is Rs. 878 878 = P + (P * R * 4) / 100 Let's subtract Case 1 from Case 2: 878 - 815 = [P + (P * R * 4) / 100] - [P + (P * R * 3) / 100] Which simplifies to: 63 = (P * R) / 100 Now, we know that the difference in years between the two cases is 1 year. This means that Rs. 63 is the simple interest earned for one year, which also specifies that the annual interest earning from the principal amount (P * R) / 100 remains constant. Therefore, we can calculate the simple interest for 3 years (the first case) by multiplying the annual interest (Rs. 63) by 3: Simple Interest for 3 years = Rs. 63 * 3 = Rs. 189 Now, we can calculate the principal amount (P) using the first case equation, where the Amount after 3 years (A) is Rs. 815: Amount (A) = P + Simple Interest P = Amount (A) - Simple Interest = Rs. (815 - 189) = Rs. 626 So, the sum of money (principal amount) is Rs. 626, which corresponds to option 'c'. The correct answer is: A: c ) 626"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

However, Saudi Arabia then accused Qatar of distorting facts about the call, and said it was ending talks. The four countries say Qatar supports terrorism - something Doha denies. The row led to all four Arab nations cutting ties with Qatar on 5 June - Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, while all four countries cut air and sea links with the country. Friday's phone call, which came after US President Donald Trump spoke separately with both sides, had initially been seen as a possible breakthrough in the crisis. The call was the first formal contact between Riyadh and Doha since the crisis began. State media on both sides reported that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had discussed the need for dialogue to resolve the crisis. Who said what? The Saudi Press Agency said Qatar's leader had \\"expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries\\", and that further details would be announced after Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. Meanwhile, the Qatar News Agency said the Saudi crown prince had proposed assigning \\"two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of states\\". Shortly afterwards, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of not being \\"serious\\" about dialogue, and said communications between the two sides would be suspended. The row appears to be over protocol - observers say Saudi Arabia is angered that Qatari state media did not make clear that the call was initiated by Doha. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, who are blockading Qatar, have presented a list of conditions for the lifting of sanctions. They include the closure of news broadcaster Al-Jazeera and reducing ties with Iran. The group accuses the Qatari-funded channel of fostering extremism, a charge the network denies. Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait and backed by Western powers have so far failed to end the dispute. On Friday, Mr Trump spoke with both sides, and the UAE, in an attempt to broker talks. \\"The president underscored that unity among the United States' Arab partners is essential to promoting regional stability and countering the threat of Iran,\\" the White House said in a statement.

Q:What is the answer for the question: Who asks the person that's smitten with Hattie to burn down the store? from the following article ? Sergio is a Toronto pastry shop assistant who is smitten with Hattie, a mousy girl who works in her father Perry's diner and refuses to consider a relationship with him until he begins to earn a decent living. An opportunity presents itself when Linzer, Sergio's employer, offers him 20,000 to torch the store so he can collect the insurance money and use it to give his wife the lifestyle he feels she deserves. Sergio declines the offer, but one night the bakery is burnt to the ground anyway. Sergio is offered 25,000 to take the blame by the millionaire father of the real culprit, the mentally unstable Garet, who set the bakery on fire as a public declaration of his love for his society girlfriend Stephanie, whose attraction to Sergio, unbeknownst to her vengeance-seeking beau, is unrequited. Despite his innocence, Sergio claims responsibility for the fire so he can use the money to claim Hattie as his own. Linzer, however, has second thoughts about allowing Sergio to pay for the crime, so he confesses he did it, while his wife insists she set the blaze to prevent her husband from being imprisoned. Sgt. Zikowski is left to determine who of the four claiming guilt is the real perpetrator.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, we first need to understand the definition of a paraphrase. A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words, often aiming to simplify or clarify the original text. Now, let's analyze the two sentences: 1. \\"Joe was born in Quincy , Massachusetts on March 27 , 1929 and grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts.\\" 2. \\"Joe was born on March 27 , 1929 in Quincy , Massachusetts , where he grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts.\\" Both sentences clearly give the same information about the person named Joe: - He was born on March 27, 1929. - He was born in Quincy, Massachusetts. - He grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts. However, there is a minor ambiguity in the second sentence. It states, \\"where he grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts.\\" The term \\"where\\" often refers to the location mentioned just before it in the sentence, which would be Quincy, not Somerville. This discrepancy might cause some confusion. Despite this ambiguity, it's evident the sentences are trying to convey the same information. So, in essence, we could consider them as paraphrases with the exception of the minor ambiguity present in the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Where was Manny driving?

Directed by Terence Young, the film is based on the 1957 novel of the same name by British author Ian Fleming. In the movie, Sean Connery reprises his role as the iconic British Secret Service agent, James Bond, following his debut in the series with \\"Dr. No\\" released in 1962. In this adaptation, the story revolves around Bond's assignment to assist in the defection of Soviet consulate clerk Tatiana Romanova, played by Italian actress Daniela Bianchi. Romanova claims to have fallen in love with Bond solely based on a photograph of him, and offers to bring a highly sought-after Lektor cryptographic device to the British side if Bond personally helps her escape to the West. However, unbeknownst to M16 and Bond, this is all a trap conceived by the criminal organization SPECTRE, led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld as part of a plan to avenge the death of their operative, Dr. No. Throughout the film, Bond comes face to face with several key SPECTRE villains, such as Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenya), a former Russian agent who defected to SPECTRE and serves as Blofeld's enforcer, and the sadistic assassin Red Grant (played by Robert Shaw). The movie showcases Bond's journey through Istanbul, Turkey, and the subsequent train ride aboard the Orient Express, as he evades traps and assassination attempts in a desperate attempt to bring Romanova and the Lektor device safely to the United Kingdom. \\"From Russia with Love\\" is often considered to be one of the best films in the entire Bond franchise due to its well-crafted script, standout performances, and memorable action scenes. The movie also incorporates key elements of the spy genre like intrigue, deception, and high-stakes situations, effectively capturing the Cold War atmosphere of the 1960s. The film's success bolstered the James Bond franchise, helping to solidify its status in popular culture and pave the way for the creation of numerous sequels and adaptations in the following years."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

No;","completion":"(1). Yes, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the plaintiffs and defendants aren't in agreement. To provide a more detailed analysis, it is essential first to understand the situation and the context provided. You have mentioned that you have provided an affidavit confirming the authenticity of specific written articles. An affidavit, by definition, is a sworn statement of facts that you attest to being true. It is utilized in legal proceedings as a written testimony. In this scenario, we can ascertain that these written articles are relevant to a dispute or a disagreement between two parties going through legal proceedings – the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs are the ones who bring forth a lawsuit against another party in a legal dispute, while the defendants are the party accused or sued in a lawsuit. Moving on, you mentioned that the affidavit was provided to both parties – plaintiffs and defendants – to avoid the necessity of testifying in person.

Article:","completion":"Title: Mysterious Disappearance of Dana Bonanno: A Concerning Delay in Police Investigation Introduction: The case of Dana Bonanno's disappearance has captured the attention of many in the Brooklyn community as well as beyond. As the details continue to unravel, the case remains shrouded in uncertainty and confusion. One of the most concerning aspects of the case is the substantial delay in police declaration for Dana as a missing person, despite the repeated calls and concern from her worried mother. Disappearance of Dana Bonanno: On July 22, Dana Bonanno, a 22-year-old woman, was last seen in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. In the days that followed, her mother grew increasingly concerned about her daughter's whereabouts and wellbeing, as she was unable to reach her directly. Despite her repeated calls and requests to the authorities, Dana Bonanno was not officially declared missing by the police until July 27, five days after her last known sighting. Dana Bonanno's mother became suspicious and concerned about the delay in the actions taken by the authorities. She voiced her worries to the media, citing that despite her numerous calls since the disappearance, no real investigation effort was made by the law enforcement officials. This has led many to question the response time and the willingness of the police to earnestly investigate missing person cases as soon as possible. Life and Involvement in Brooklyn Music Scene: Dana Bonanno was well-known and actively involved in the vibrant Brooklyn music scene. Her passion for music and the arts made her a widely recognized figure in the local community, and this brought an extensive group of friends and colleagues who were equally invested and concerned about her disappearance. The news of her missing status rapidly spread through the Brooklyn music scene and beyond, with many expressing concern and sympathy towards Dana and her family, eventually turning into a city-wide search to find her. Despite her love for music and active social life, Dana's friends and family expressed that she was a responsible and cautious person by nature—making her sudden disappearance all the more perplexing. They emphasized that it was highly out of character for her to be out of contact for such an extended period, further fueling their concerns and suspicions about what may have transpired leading to her sudden absence. Community Response and Continued Search: As the press picked up on the mysterious disappearance and the subsequent lack of timely investigation by the police, there was a widespread outpour of concern for Dana Bonanno's safety within the Brooklyn community. Community groups, friends, and family began organizing search groups and leaflet campaigns to raise awareness and gather any information about her disappearance. Social media platforms were ablaze with the hashtag #FindDana, aiming to spread the news of her missing status and support search efforts with every share and retweet. The delay in the police investigation and in declaring Dana a missing person has raised questions regarding the efficiency and attitude of the authorities towards such cases. Concerned residents and community leaders demand answers as to why there was such a significant delay in the official investigation. They emphasize the critical importance of time and rapid action in these situations, as any delay could lead to dire consequences for the missing person. Conclusion: The disappearance of Dana Bonanno has not only shed light on the inefficiencies of the police and their responsiveness but has also demonstrated the immense power of community mobilization and support. The authorities' delay in declaring Dana a missing person is both concerning and unacceptable. As the search for Dana continues, the case should serve as a wakeup call for both law enforcement and the wider community to prioritize the investigation of missing persons cases with speed, diligence, and care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Investigating the Allegations: 1. Step one: Gathering information Melanie Onn, the Labour MP, suggests that an extensive investigation is needed in order to uncover the validity and extent of the bullying allegations. This involves gathering and examining any available documentation related to the claims, including staff complaints, incident reports, and internal communications. 2. Step two: Speaking to the whistleblower and affected staff members It is essential to have direct communication with the individual who brought forward the allegations and any staff members that have been affected by the bullying. This will help provide a more accurate understanding of the situation and gather insights into the internal dynamics and work culture at the hospital trust. Addressing the Fear of Speaking Out: 3. Step three: Ensuring a safe and supportive environment It is important to create an environment in which staff feels safe and comfortable coming forward with concerns. This can be achieved by establishing an anonymous reporting system and offering reassurance that all complaints will be treated confidentially. 4. Step four: Implementing proactive measures to prevent future incidents To prevent any future instances of bullying or harassment, hospital trust executives should closely monitor the work environment and implement training programs to teach staff members about identifying, reporting, and responding to incidents of this nature. Taking Action: 5. Step five: Holding those responsible accountable If the investigation proves that bullying exists within the hospital trust, it will be crucial to hold the responsible individuals accountable for their actions. This may include disciplinary action, reassignment or termination, depending on the severity of the incident. 6. Step six: Offering support and resources to affected staff Hospital trust executives should offer support and resources to those affected by the bullying, including counselling services and opportunities to discuss the situation with independent parties for advice. Conclusion: Melanie Onn's call for a thorough investigation into the alleged bullying incidents at the hospital trust highlights the importance of creating and maintaining a safe and supportive work environment for all employees.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What can large amounts of water do to wood?\\" is in \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Large amounts of water can have a significant impact on wood, affecting both its physical properties and overall integrity. When wood is exposed to high levels of water content, it becomes softer and more pliable. This can be compared to the softening effects of water on materials such as rawhide, paper, or cloth. As the water content increases, so does the extent of its softening impact on wood. Water exposure can lead to numerous changes in wood's structure and properties. Some of these effects include: 1. Swelling: When wood absorbs water, it swells and expands. This swelling can cause distortions in the wood's shape, leading to warping, bowing, or cupping. As wood dries, it may also shrink unevenly and lead to further deformations. 2. Rot and Decay: Prolonged exposure to moisture creates an environment conducive to the growth of fungi and bacteria, which can cause wood to rot and decay. This process weakens the wood's structural integrity, leading to damage or even collapse of the wooden structure. 3. Discoloration: Water exposure can cause discoloration and staining of wood. Tannins, natural compounds present in wood, can leach out when in contact with water, resulting in dark, unsightly stains. Watermarks can also form on the wood's surface due to water absorption and evaporation. 4. Mold and Mildew growth: High levels of moisture promote the growth of mold and mildew on the surface of wood. Mold can cause discoloration and an unpleasant odor, and it may also pose potential health risks. 5. Weakening of joints and fasteners: When wood absorbs water, it can lead to the weakening and loosening of joints and fasteners holding wooden structures together. This can compromise the structural strength and stability of wooden structures, such as furniture and buildings. 6. Delamination: Water exposure can also cause wood veneers and laminates to separate from their substrate, resulting in delamination or peeling. 7. Finish degradation: Prolonged exposure to water can also cause damage to wood finishes, like paint, varnish, or stain. This may result in peeling, cracking, or fading of the finish, which not only affects the wood's appearance but also diminishes its protection against further water damage. To mitigate these potential problems, it's essential to prevent excessive moisture exposure to wood and maintain proper water content levels within acceptable ranges. One can achieve this through protective treatments, adequate ventilation, and moisture management in the surrounding environment. Regular maintenance and inspection of wooden structures can also help to detect water-related issues at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention and repairs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In sponges, how do blastula develop into a new sponge? Is \\"In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task The user is asking for the process by which blastula develop into a new sponge in sponges and whether the provided answer is correct or not. We need to verify and provide a comprehensive explanation. Step 2: Research the development process in sponges Sponges have a unique development process for their larvae. Specifically, they undergo metamorphosis from blastula stage to mature sponge. Step 3: Verify the provided answer The provided answer states that \\"In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.\\" This statement is partially correct but lacks a detailed explanation of the developmental process. Step 4: Provide a complete answer In sponges, the development process starts with fertilization which leads to the formation of a zygote. The zygote undergoes multiple rounds of cell division to form a blastula. The blastula is a hollow, spherical structure containing flagellated cells called choanocytes on the surface, which help the blastula to swim in the water in search of a suitable location to settle down. Once a suitable location is found, the blastula larva undergoes a process called gastrulation, during which the hollow structure inverts and the cells rearrange to form three distinct layers: the outermost layer called the ectoderm, the middle layer called the mesohyl, and the innermost layer called the endoderm. Throughout the process, cells continue to differentiate and specialize. As the developing larva further matures, it starts developing structures like canal systems for filtering water, osculum for expelling water, and choanocytes for capturing food particles. These processes eventually lead to the formation of a new, fully-functional sponge. Step 5: Finalize the response In sponges, the blastula develop into a new sponge through a series of developmental stages. Starting as a zygote, the embryo transforms into a blastula which swims to a new location using its flagellated choanocytes. Upon finding a suitable location, the blastula undergoes gastrulation to form three distinct layers and then continues to develop specialized structures and tissue layers. Ultimately, this process results in the formation of a fully-functional, mature sponge.

Leaving the cheese in the cellar for a few years allows it to age well, which enhances its flavor and texture. The cellar provides the perfect environment for the cheese to mature, as it typically has a consistent temperature, high humidity, and minimal light exposure. As the cheese ages, its flavor profile develops and becomes deeper, richer, and more complex. This process also tends to create a firmer and more crumbly texture in many types of cheese. Therefore, John was told to leave the cheese in the cellar to achieve a better and more flavorful cheese through the aging process.

Background: Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma (Zulu: [gelZhejile'kisa 'zhuma]; born 12 April 1942) is a South African politician who served as the fourth President of South Africa from the 2009 general election until his resignation on 14 February 2018. Zuma is also referred to by his initials JZ and his clan name Msholozi. Zuma served as Deputy President of South Africa from 1999 to 2005, but was dismissed by President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 after Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of soliciting a bribe for Zuma. Zuma was nonetheless elected President of the African National Congress (ANC) on 18 December 2007 after defeating Mbeki at the ANC conference in Polokwane. Context: Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit and applied to the Constitutional Court to appeal Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson's ruling: It was improper for the court to make such far-reaching \\"vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial\\" findings concerning me, to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter. The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified. These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC - a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years. I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice. Tlali Tlali, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman, stated by phone from Pretoria, on 23 September, \\"We have received the papers. It's under consideration.\\" The judgement for the appeal was handed down on 12 January 2009 at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to rule on two aspects of the appeal. The first aspect was whether or not Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before they decided to reinstate charges of bribery and corruption against him. The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in implying political meddling by the then President Thabo Mbeki with regards to the NPA's decision to charge Zuma. On the question of the NPA's obligation to invite representations when reviewing decisions, Harms DP found that Nicholson's interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution was incorrect in that the NPA did not have such an obligation and thus was free to have charged Zuma as it did. On the question of Nicholson's inferences of political meddling by Mbeki, Harms DP found that the lower court \\"overstepped the limits of its authority\\". Question: Did these findings cause any further problems? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the findings of the Supreme Court of Appeal did lead to further problems and consequences for both Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki, as well as for the political landscape of South Africa. Following the ruling, a series of events unfolded that impacted various aspects of South African politics, primarily the African National Congress (ANC) party, and created tensions within the administration. 1. Impact on Jacob Zuma: Although Deputy Judge President Louis Harms ruled that the NPA did not have the obligation to invite representations when reviewing decisions, this did not stop the charges of bribery and corruption against Zuma from continuing. In addition to his legal struggles, Zuma's reputation was further tarnished, affecting public confidence in his ability to lead the country. 2. Impact on Thabo Mbeki: The Supreme Court of Appeal's ruling, which stated that Judge Nicholson had \\"overstepped the limits of his authority\\" in implying political meddling by Mbeki, did not help in repairing Mbeki's image. The damage had been done, and the negative perception of political interference by Mbeki persisted. As a result, his political career was severely impacted when he was recalled by the ANC, leading to his resignation as President of South Africa before the end of his term. 3. Impact on the ANC: The legal proceedings and political infighting between Zuma and Mbeki supporters within the ANC caused a significant split in the party, affecting its unity and stability. Many members were forced to choose sides in this political battle, which weakened the party as a whole and impacted its ability to effectively govern the country. 4. Impact on South African politics: The rivalry between Zuma and Mbeki, as well as the legal troubles involving the highest office of the land, led to increased political uncertainty in South Africa. This not only impacted investor confidence in the country but also diverted attention away from crucial issues such as economic development, poverty, and inequality. In summary, the findings of the Supreme Court of Appeal further complicated the already tense political situation in South Africa. The ruling had a domino effect on Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki's political careers and reputations, disrupted the unity and stability of the ANC, and contributed to the deterioration of South Africa's political climate. This, in turn, had far-reaching consequences on the overall governance and development of the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

According to Buzzfeed people around Petraeus say he's been thinking hard about how to manage his comeback, his image, and his new role outside national security. Petraeus has always been famous both for his intelligence and for his ability to manage the press, and he has signaled that he has thought hard about his predicament.

Last month he made a speech at the University of Southern California where he apologized to those he'd hurt with his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said. 'I know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and on a number of others,' Petraeus said, according to news reports. 'I can, however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings and, as best as possible, to make amends to those I have hurt and let down' He has signaled he’s ready to move on: 'One learns after all that life doesn't stop with such a mistake. It can and must go on.' He is also dealing with a lingering investigation as to whether he inappropriately shared secret documents with Broadwell.

Josie started planning her new garden in the winter. She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area. She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt. But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow. Question: \\"How did Josie get her vegetables to grow so quickly?\\" Response: \\"Pesticides\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct? Choose your answer from: [+] no. [+] yes.","completion":"[+] no. The response is not factually correct. The paragraph does not mention the use of pesticides at all. Instead, it talks about Josie planting seeds indoors six weeks before the last frost, then slowly introducing the seedlings to outdoor temperatures, and adding a special growing mix to the soil to improve the conditions for growth.

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

Are there any supplements out there that actually burn belly fat and lower body fat? Are there any herbal supplements that burn fat? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"To complete this task, I will first research and find information about supplements that may help burn belly fat and lower body fat. Then, I will look into herbal supplements that may help burn fat. Finally, I will analyze the questions and determine if they are paraphrases of each other. Step 1: Research supplements that burn belly fat and lower body fat After doing some research, there are a few supplements that have been suggested to potentially help with burning belly fat and lowering body fat. They include: 1. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA): Studies show mixed results, but CLA may help to reduce body fat in some individuals. 2. Green Tea Extract: Contains EGCG, which has been shown to increase the metabolic rate and support fat oxidation. 3. Caffeine: Can boost metabolism and help the body break down fat, but its effectiveness may decrease over time as the body builds a tolerance. 4. Garcinia Cambogia: Studies have suggested it may help with fat loss, but more research is needed. 5. Glucomannan: A natural fiber supplement that can help promote feelings of fullness, which may lead to reduced calorie intake and weight loss. However, it's important to note that the efficacy of these supplements is not universally agreed upon, and the best way to lose belly fat and lower body fat is through regular exercise and a healthy diet. Step 2: Research herbal supplements that burn fat Certain herbal supplements may help with fat burning. Some of these include: 1. Green Tea Extract 2. Cayenne Pepper 3. Taraxacum (Dandelion) 4. Yohimbine (from Yohimbe tree bark) 5. Ginger 6. Forskolin (from Coleus forskohlii) 7. Fucoxanthin (from brown seaweed) Again, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these herbal supplements may vary between individuals, and a healthy diet and exercise routine are crucial components of any fat loss program. Step 3: Analyze the questions and determine if they are paraphrases of each other The first question asks about supplements that help burn belly fat and lower body fat, while the second question asks about herbal supplements that burn fat. Although both questions are related to fat-burning supplements, they are not direct paraphrases of each other. The first question is specifically asking about supplements to address belly fat and lower body fat, while the second question is focused on herbal supplements and does not mention belly fat or lower body fat specifically."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Putin quietly signed a new law requiring popular online voices to register with the government, a measure that lawyers, Internet pioneers and political activists said Tuesday would give the government a much wider ability to track who said what online. Mr. Putin’s action on Monday, just weeks after he disparaged the Internet as “a special C.I.A. project,” borrowed a page from the restrictive Internet playbooks of many governments around the world that have been steadily smothering online freedoms they once tolerated. The idea that the Internet was at best controlled anarchy and beyond any one nation’s control is fading globally amid determined attempts by more and more governments to tame the web. If innovations like Twitter were hailed as recently as the Arab uprisings as the new public square, governments like those in China, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and now Russia are making it clear that they can deploy their tanks on virtual squares, too. China, long a pioneer in using sophisticated technology to filter the Internet, has continually tightened censorship. It has banned all major Western online social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google, though it seems not to be bothered by Alibaba, its homegrown e-commerce site, which has filed the paperwork for what could be the biggest public stock offering ever. ||||| Story highlights Putin signs off on new law banning swearing in music, film and books Under the law, individuals and businesses can be fined for using foul language It covers live arts and entertainment performances, including plays and concerts New films containing swear words won't get a distribution certificate Thinking about making a film? Better leave out the foul language if you want it to be seen in Russia. The same goes for plays. Even rock stars will need to leave their potty mouths at home. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a new law Monday that bans swearing at arts, cultural and entertainment events in the country. Any new film containing obscene language won't be granted a distribution certificate, so there's no chance of seeing it at the movie theater. And copies of books, CDs or films containing swearing can only be distributed in a sealed package labeled \\"Contains obscene language,\\" a Kremlin statement said. According to state news agency ITAR-Tass, individuals caught using foul language face a fine of up to 70, while officials can be fined up to 40 and businesses nearly 1,400. They face a higher fine and a three-month suspension of business for repeated offenses. JUST WATCHED Russia's president annexes ... words Replay More Videos ...

According to the Kremlin, the legislation \\"bans the use of obscene language when ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the use of the state language, and protecting and developing language culture.\\" The law could come into effect as soon as July 1, ITAR-Tass said, but it doesn't apply to cultural and artistic works that have already been issued. While some may hail attempts to clean up the nation's language, it will likely be seen by critics as the latest step under Putin's leadership to limit freedom of expression and promote a conservative, nationalist viewpoint. A report by rights group Amnesty International in January highlighted a denial of \\"basic freedoms\\" in Russia, which last year introduced a law barring anyone from talking positively about homosexuality in earshot of minors. ||||| Putin's Internet Plan Requires 'Sharing' With Security Services i itoggle caption Alexey Nikolsky/RIO Novosti/Kremlin pool/EPA/Landov Alexey Nikolsky/RIO Novosti/Kremlin pool/EPA/Landov Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new measure that will give the government much greater control over the Internet. Critics say the law is aimed at silencing opposition bloggers and restricting what people can say on social media. It would also force international email providers and social networks to make their users' information available to the Russian security services. Putin sent a chill through many Internet users late last month with this comment at a media forum: \\"You do know that it all began initially, when the Internet first appeared, as a special CIA project. And this is the way it is developing.\\" I think anything that's published in a blog, that's not to the authorities' liking, can be used against the person who writes the blog. Putin said Americans set the system up so that everything would go through servers in the United States, where intelligence agencies could monitor it. The president's statement came as Russia's parliament was working on a package of bills that would place restrictions on bloggers and websites. Bloggers Must Register \\"The objective of those laws is to block the Russian Internet from the rest of the world,\\" says Anton Nosik, a popular blogger, \\"and to shut down the biggest foreign social networks, to block access to foreign social networks for Russian users, and to establish control over networks that are physically based in Russia.\\" One key provision of the law, which is scheduled to take effect in August, would require bloggers to register with the government if their blogs receive more than 3,000 hits a day. Registered bloggers would then be treated like mass media and required to certify the factual accuracy of the information in their blogs, but they wouldn't have the same protections and privileges as other journalists. One of the leading sponsors of the law, Irina Yarovaya, made it clear what lawmakers are aiming for — an end to anonymity on the Internet in Russia. \\"In principle, anonymity is always deception,\\" she said in an interview earlier this year. \\"It's a wish to mislead someone. I can't see any reason to raise lying to [the status of] a human virtue or an understanding of what freedom is.\\" The law also gives the government new grounds to press charges against bloggers, including \\"defamation\\" and \\"inciting hatred.\\" New Restrictions For Social Networks Journalist Kirill Martynov says these rather vaguely defined offenses could make it impossible to express meaningful opinions. \\"I can't incite hatred toward fascists, for example, or I can't criticize police officers,\\" Martynov says. \\"I think anything that's published in a blog, that's not to the authorities' liking, can be used against the person who writes the blog.\\" Another provision of the law prohibits revealing information about citizens' homes and their personal or family lives. Critics say that provision could be used against anti-corruption bloggers who have revealed embarrassing details about undeclared bank accounts and luxurious homes owned by public officials. Finally, Nosik notes that the law says that all email providers and social networks must store information about users, their posts and their email on servers in Russia. \\"This is what Russian authorities traditionally request from local platforms, and they are always given that information,\\" he says. \\"I doubt it strongly that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, or other Google services will ever comply. And if they don't comply, they have to be blocked. That's what the law says.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new law that requires popular online voices to register with the government. This will help the government track who says what online. They are trying to control what people say on the internet, especially on social media.

Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. The premise states that Derry and the speaker (\\"I\\") stayed up all night. This indicates that they dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to the task, showing their commitment to working hard. 2. The premise also mentions they cross-checked autobiographies, which is a diligent method of verifying the information being documented.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: If you want to make your fabric a particular size, place the vinyl over an object that’s as large as you want it to be. If you’re stretching vinyl out for a specific reason, such as to reupholster a piece of furniture, place the fabric on top of the object in question. If you’d like, you can place your vinyl over the object in question before heating it up. To stretch out your vinyl, grab 1 end of the fabric with your fingers and slowly pull it toward yourself. If you’re working with firm 2-way vinyl, feel free to use a lot of force while pulling. If you’re stretching thin 4-way vinyl, pull carefully to avoid tearing the fabric. If necessary, hold the other side of the vinyl down with a bar clamp or ask a friend to keep it in place. As your vinyl stretches, it may develop small, unappealing wrinkles. To remove these, simply press down on the fabric with your fingers and smooth them out. If you’re stretching the vinyl over a specific object, make sure to press out any creases or air bubbles that form. Over time, your vinyl will cool down and become harder to manipulate. If this happens while you’re stretching it out, grab your heat gun and run it over the material again. Do not press your heat gun to the vinyl fabric. If you do, you may damage the vinyl itself as well as the material underneath. If your vinyl starts to overstretch, make small incisions along the edges of the fabric with a pair of scissors or a precision knife. This will give you the ability to pull on 1 portion of the fabric without affecting the other parts. Only use this technique on pieces of fabric where the edges won’t be visible, such as vinyl upholstery. If you’re pulling the vinyl around an object with curves, you may need to cut the fabric to help it better fit the object’s shape. If you’re using your vinyl to reupholster an object, you’ll need to secure the material to keep it from peeling off. To do so, pull the fabric as tight as you can and hold it down to the object. Then, use a staple gun to shoot staples into the vinyl fabric. Place staples between 1 and 2 in (2.5 and 5.1 cm) apart around the entire perimeter of the object. When finished, you should have a long line of evenly spaced staples. If necessary, ask a friend to hold the fabric down or use a bar clamp to keep it in place while you staple it.","completion":"To resize and stretch vinyl fabric for a specific item or purpose, like reupholstering furniture, follow these steps: 1. Place the vinyl over the object that you want to cover, ensuring it's the desired size. You can heat the vinyl before placing it over the object if preferred. 2. Gently pull the vinyl towards yourself, using more force for firm 2-way vinyl and careful pulling for thin 4-way vinyl. This helps prevent tearing. 3. Use a bar clamp or a friend's assistance to hold the other side of the vinyl in place while stretching. This ensures even stretching. 4. Smooth out any wrinkles, creases, or air bubbles with your fingers to give the fabric a polished appearance. 5. If the vinyl cools down and becomes harder to manipulate, use a heat gun to warm up the material, being careful not to press the heat gun against the vinyl to avoid damage. 6. In case of overstretching, make small incisions along the edges of the fabric with scissors or a precision knife, allowing you to stretch one part without affecting the others. This technique should be used only when the edges won't be visible, such as in upholstery. 7. For objects with curves, you may need to cut the fabric to help it fit the shape better. 8. To secure the vinyl fabric to the object, pull it tight and hold it down. Use a staple gun to attach the fabric by placing staples 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart around the object's entire perimeter, achieving an even line of staples. 9. Enlist the help of a friend or use a bar clamp to hold the fabric in place while stapling, ensuring a secure and tight fit.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Critical thinking is an important skill that can increase students' ability to learn in any situation. This can be applied to traditional education, or directly in a career related role. Many teachers find it such a valuable skill that they give their students a critical thinking question every day. Developing this ability can mean the difference between \\"just passing a course\\" and \\"understanding the material well enough\\" so that what students learn from _ will follow them throughout their life. Some characteristics of a critical thinker that teachers should encourage are; -asking questions as a reaction to something read or discussed; -determining the \\"deeper meaning\\" of a particular passage or topic; -providing input and opinions to topics as a direct result of analysis and research; -reasoning in an effort to develop an argument of your own opinion. It is important for a student to understand more than definition . One way to truly understand an idea is to have hands-on practice, and to apply concepts learned in a textbook. Such \\"mini-examples\\" will interest a student and improve their understanding of a topic. This is how life-long skills can be developed. Teachers that use critical thinking practices in the classroom can \\"go above and beyond\\" by asking questions that promote a greater comprehension of the material. Instructors should be able to challenge students and create an environment where they are analyzing material and gaining a better understanding. This will make the classroom move in a direction for learning. It can also help students to stay interested in the course material, as they always have a new concept to consider. At the same time, students benefit greatly from developing critical thinking skills. When learned early on, these skills can be used throughout their college education. Students can understand how to consider a topic, analyze it, and discuss it from different points of view. These are skills that will benefit them when they are part of the workforce as well.

Choices: - pollinating seeds - fertilizing them - protecting them - spreading seeds A: Answer:","completion":"Fruit-eating bats receive food from plants and, in return, help these plants primarily by spreading seeds. They do so by consuming the fruits and later dispersing the seeds through their droppings (guano). This process of seed dispersal is essential for maintaining the reproductive cycle and overall health of various plant species, especially those found in tropical and subtropical regions. In addition to seed dispersal, fruit-eating bats can also contribute to the pollination of plants. While they are not as effective as nectar-feeding bats in this process, their fur and bodies can become covered in pollen as they forage from plant to plant, facilitating some degree of pollination. However, their primary role in helping plants remains focused on seed dispersal. To provide a more comprehensive answer, let's explore each of the choices in detail: 1. Pollinating seeds: Although fruit-eating bats are not primarily responsible for pollinating plants, they can still contribute indirectly to the process. As already mentioned, when they feed on fruits, some pollen may get stuck to their fur or bodies, and as they move between plants, pollen can get transferred, resulting in cross-pollination. 2. Fertilizing them: Fertilization is not a direct result of fruit-eating bats' interaction with plants. However, their droppings can serve as a natural fertilizer by adding essential nutrients to the soil, which benefits plant growth indirectly. After consuming fruits, the bats expel seeds through their guano, which then decomposes and releases nutrients back into the soil. 3. Protecting them: Fruit-eating bats do not specifically protect plants from any external threats like predators or diseases. Their primary interaction with plants is through consuming fruits and facilitating seed dispersal. 4. Spreading seeds (Primary role): As mentioned earlier, fruit-eating bats play a crucial role in seed dispersal. They eat fruits from a variety of plant species, digest the soft pulp, and later excrete the undigested seeds away from the parent plant. This process enables the seeds to germinate in a new location, preventing overcrowding and competition for resources and promoting genetic diversity among plant populations. Due to their ability to travel long distances, fruit-eating bats are highly efficient at spreading seeds across vast areas. In conclusion, fruit-eating bats mainly help plants by spreading seeds, although they can contribute to pollination and fertilization indirectly through their foraging habits and guano. These bats play a critical ecological role by assisting in the maintenance and propagation of plant species within their habitat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina.

This article: The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the Netherlandish painter who was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective?, what is it ?

A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice. Children with \\"automaticity\\" can read faster because they_.

Write a title for this article: WILLIAMSTOWN — In the 1970s and 1980s, there may have been no more important playwright in America than Sam Shepard, who somehow also found time during those years to cut a pretty fair swath as a movie star. But in recent years he has seemed to dip below the theatrical horizon. Now comes Williamstown Theatre Festival’s new production of Shepard’s “Fool for Love,’’ directed by Daniel Aukin, and it’s doubly welcome: as a reminder of the playwright’s groundbreaking voice and unsparing vision, and as a showcase for Sam Rockwell and Nina Arianda, who seem utterly at home in Shepard country as they face off in the play’s volatile dance of memory and desire. About that broken ground, though: In the three decades since “Fool for Love’’ premiered, the culture has made such a reflexive habit of traveling to dark Shepardian places — hello there, HBO — that the revelation at the heart of the play no longer seems as shocking as it once did. Shepard has always been preoccupied with the American West — as a place, an idea, a corroded myth — and this is a case where settlers have muscled in on the pioneer’s territory. But emulation is not the same as replication. It’s hard to match Shepard’s singular effects of language and tone, his ability to create characters who are specific yet elusive, and his knack for blending gritty realism and the ongoing sense that we’re inside a kind of hallucination. Absorbing though the Williamstown production consistently is, though, “Fool for Love’’ registers today as a surprisingly fragmentary work; at 75 minutes, it’s over too soon. Strangely, or perhaps not, we want to spend more time in the company of Eddie and May, two ex-lovers who have the stormiest imaginable reunion. Not that the prefix “ex’’ fits comfortably in the context of a relationship as long-running and mysterious as that between Rockwell’s Eddie, a laconic and enigmatic rodeo stuntman, and Arianda’s May, who’s working as a cook while staying in a dingy motel room on the outskirts of the Mojave Desert. From the opening moments of “Fool for Love,’’ when May wordlessly wraps her arms around Eddie’s legs and won’t let go, it’s clear that theirs is a mutually obsessive, all-devouring passion. But it’s not long before other kinds of passion — jealousy, recriminations — begin to flare. Much of the heat is generated by May, who is furious at Eddie’s apparent dalliance with a wealthy woman she witheringly refers to as “the Countess.’’ Eddie wants May back. “You know we’re connected, May,’’ he says, adding cryptically: “We’ll always be connected. That was decided a long time ago.’’ May wants to rewrite that script (“You’re like a disease to me,’’ she tells him), and besides, she’s got a date with a nice local fellow named Martin (Christopher Abbott, excellent). To May’s deep annoyance, Eddie draws Martin into their psychodrama. Yep, it’s clearly time for May to move on. If only she could. There is one other character: the Old Man, portrayed by Gordon Joseph Weiss, who sits in a corner of the motel room, observing the action and periodically addressing Eddie and May. He lives only in their minds, but he’s a crucial figure when it comes to understanding the exact nature of their relationship. Director Aukin conjures a bleakly claustrophobic atmosphere and adds small touches that escalate the tension and keep the audience on edge (we know that the potential for violence is always ticking away just below the surface in a Shepard play). Whenever Eddie slams the motel room door shut, it resounds like a nerve-rattling thunderclap. The performances by Arianda and Rockwell are all the more impressive when you consider they only stepped into the roles a little over a month ago, after Lauren Ambrose (“Six Feet Under’’) and Chris Pine (“Star Trek’’) dropped out, citing scheduling conflicts. Anyone who saw Arianda’s blazing, Tony Award-winning performance in David Ives’s “Venus in Fur’’ knows that the wilder the material, the more she ups her game. In “Fool for Love,’’ the actress delivers an intensely compelling portrait of a woman tearing at the boundaries of her own life. She offers us piercing glimpses, too, of May’s vulnerability and confusion, defeat and resiliency. Rockwell’s portrayal of Eddie is so natural and self-assured that at one point the actor effortlessly executes a forward split at center stage, apparently just for the hell of it, then bounds back to his feet. Eddie carries himself like the Marlboro Man, but this cowboy’s West is a shrunken one: When he tosses his lasso, all he’s roping is a bedpost. When it comes to the tangled intersections of their personal histories, May, Eddie, and the Old Man all get to have their say. Indeed, they all aggressively insist on it. In the fierce contest of wills waged on the blasted landscape of “Fool for Love,’’ control of the story may be the only prize left.","completion":"Title: \\"Fool for Love: A Fiery Reunion of Love and Desire at Williamstown Theatre Festival\\""},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who kept private the nature of her illness until after her death? ? Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","completion":"Ferrier"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation.

There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor.

They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the same mistake as the music industry","completion":"The phrase \\"the same mistake as the music industry\\" is generally considered to have a negative connotation. To fully understand and interpret this phrase, let's dissect its components and historical context. 1. Context and meaning: On its own, the phrase is somewhat ambiguous, and the meaning depends on the context in which it is used. When it refers to \\"the same mistake,\\" it implies there is an error in judgment or an oversight that had previously occurred in the music industry. When this comparison is made in any scenario, it typically represents a negative repercussion that could occur again, this time to the subject it is being compared to. 2. Music industry background: The music industry has faced several challenges and controversies over time. Among these challenges are piracy, loss of revenue, changing listening habits, and an ongoing battle to adapt to the digital age. Many of these issues emerged with the advent of online file-sharing platforms like the now-defunct Napster, which facilitated illegal music downloads, causing significant financial losses for artists and record labels. 3. Lesson learned: The music industry's slow response to adapt to the changing landscape led to lost opportunities and considerable damage to its business models. It serves as an example of what can happen to industries and organizations that fail to adapt and change promptly in the face of new challenges and technologies. 4. Applying this phrase: When someone says \\"the same mistake as the music industry,\\" they are likely referring to a situation where a person or organization is failing to recognize or adapt to changes in the environment or is at risk of facing similar negative consequences. It serves as a warning that being unprepared for change or unable to pivot in the dynamic market can lead to undesirable results and potentially significant losses. In conclusion, the phrase \\"the same mistake as the music industry\\" holds a negative connotation, primarily due to the music industry's historical struggles and mistakes. The phrase is often used as a warning or as a reference to the potential consequences of not learning from past mistakes or adjusting to new changes quickly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Poland's foreign minister has allegedly been caught on tape comparing his country's relationship with the U.S. as like giving oral sex for nothing in return. Radek Sikorski is said to have made the controversial remarks during a private conversation with Jacek Rostowski, an MP and former finance minister, after they were published by influential news magazine Wprost. In a short transcript of the conversation, a person identified as Sikorski also says Poland's strong alliance with the U.S. was worthless and 'even harmful because it creates a false sense of security.' Controversy: Radek Sikorski (pictured) is said to have made the controversial remarks during a private conversation with Jacek Rostowski, former finance minister, which was published by news magazine Wprost. 'The Polish-American alliance is not. worth anything. It’s even damaging, because it creates a false sense of. security in Poland,' Sikorski allegedly said in a translation by Russia Today. 'Complete. bulls***,' the tape purportedly records Sikorski as saying. 'We will. get a conflict with both Russians and Germans, and we’re going to think. that everything is great, because we gave the Americans a blow***. Suckers. Total suckers.' He. allegedly goes on to criticise Poles as naive, in the latest recorded. revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's. government. 'The problem in. Poland is that we have a very shallow pride and low self-esteem,' he. allegedly said, decrying such a mindset as 'Murzyńskość', a. racially-charged pejorative term that could be translated as 'thinking. like a negro.' Sikorski suggested on Twitter the translation should be. 'negritude,' linking it to the anti-colonialism movement in Europe,. according to Russia Today. Kerry on as normal: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, speaks during a press conference last year after talks with Sikorski, right, in Warsaw, Poland. The. Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but did not deny that Sikorski made. the remarks. Government spokesman Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska said. officials would only comment after the recording is published in full. Wprost has only provided a transcript of excerpts of the conversation, which it said was recorded in the spring. The magazine has said the sound files will be published today or tomorrow. While the alleged Sikorski comments do not reveal any illegal actions, if confirmed, they would likely put Poland's top diplomat on the defensive. The prime minister's office said Tusk was likely to address the issue Monday. Diplomatic storm: It is the latest recorded revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government. Wprost already last week set off a. political storm with the release of a recording of a conversation. between central bank head Marek Belka and Interior Minister Bartlomiej. Sienkiewicz. In the recording, the two discussed how the bank could help. the governing party win re-election in 2015, an apparent violation of. the bank's independence. Critics responded by calling on Tusk's. government to resign. Sikorski has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and has strongly criticized Russian actions in neighboring Ukraine this year. In the past he was a strong supporter of the United States. But he has become more critical of Washington in recent years, especially after President Barack Obama's attempted 'reset' of ties with Russia in 2009 and the subsequent scaling-down of the U.S. missile defense plan for Poland and other parts of eastern Europe. Amid recent violence in Ukraine, Sikorski has been calling for a substantial U.S. troop presence on Polish soil. He has also been widely mentioned as a possible successor to Catherine Ashton as the EU's foreign policy chief. Poland officially put him forward as a candidate last month. 'The publishing of the tapes poses a threat to the social and political order of the state,\\" sociologist Henryk Domanski said on TVN24 news channel. \\"This will have repercussions for Sikorski and for his international career, but on the other hand, Sikorski is known in the world for his strong, extreme statements.' Wprost has not revealed the source of the recordings, other than to say that they were obtained from a businessman who did not make them. In Poland, secretly recording a conversation is a crime. Some Poles wonder whether Russia might have a hand in the revelations, on the argument that the Kremlin benefits from a destabilized Poland. While the source of the recording remains unclear, political analyst Rafal Chwedoruk said he believed that the case was about political fighting and 'internal games' — with international implications. 'But if indeed foreign intelligence was involved, that involvement would be so deeply hidden that we would not be able to track it down for years,' he told The Associated Press.

Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","completion":"Does the Garcinia Supplement for Men Work Effectively as in Women? Read This Article to Know the Answer and Get the Right Place to Buy. Garcinia supplements have gained quite a name in recent years for their potential weight loss benefits. Derived from the rind of the fruit Garcinia Cambogia, native to Southeast Asia, these supplements have been credited with assisting in weight loss efforts by curbing appetite and inhibiting fat production. A primary compound found in Garcinia Cambogia, Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), has been the focal point of scientific studies to ascertain its effectiveness in contributing to weight loss. While the popularity of Garcinia supplements among women is well-known, a frequently asked question is whether it works equally effectively in men. Although studies and research on the effectiveness of Garcinia supplements are limited, it is valuable to understand that men and women fundamentally possess the same biological mechanisms that can benefit from Garcinia supplements. By analyzing existing research, it is evident that Garcinia supplements can be effective for both men and women in the following ways: 1. Appetite suppression: HCA present in Garcinia supplements has been found to increase serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that affects mood and appetite regulation. Increased serotonin levels lead to a feeling of satiety, helping individuals control hunger and food cravings, which in turn aids weight loss. 2. Fat production inhibition: Garcinia Cambogia is thought to prevent the conversion of excess carbohydrates into fat by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for this conversion, citrate lyase. This can be beneficial for both men and women in their weight loss journey. 3. Enhanced energy levels: Garcinia supplements are said to improve metabolism, leading to increased energy production by breaking down stored body fats. This helps both men and women engage in regular physical activity, further promoting weight loss. However, it is essential to bear in mind that these supplements are not a magic pill for weight loss. Garcinia supplements should be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise to facilitate weight loss goals. A vital aspect to keep in mind for men is that they might require a slightly higher dosage of the supplement compared to women, due to their higher muscle mass and basal metabolic rate. To find the right place to buy Garcinia supplements, it is highly recommended to consider the following factors: 1. Reputable brand: Opt for a well-established and reputable brand of Garcinia supplements to ensure product quality and safety. 2. Purity and potency: A potent Garcinia supplement should have at least 50% HCA. Look for a supplement that contains pure Garcinia Cambogia extract without any artificial fillers, binders, or additives. 3. Third-party testing: It is safer to buy supplements that have been independently tested by third-party labs to confirm their purity and potency. 4. Label directions: Always read and follow the label directions for usage, dosage, and potential side effects to enhance the supplement's safety and effectiveness. In conclusion, existing evidence suggests that Garcinia supplements can work effectively for both men and women, provided an appropriate dosage is used, and they are consumed alongside a healthy lifestyle. To purchase a quality Garcinia supplement, focus on reputable brands, third-party tested products, and pay close attention to labels for proper dosage and usage guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Article: What are the five or six defining features of your industry? Read industry publications or online articles for help, and write up a list of words. These words can help you come up with a brand name. For example, the following buzzwords might describe the tech industry: agile, explosive, change, connect. Come up with a list of adjectives you want consumers to associate with your brand name. These adjectives can be your company’s values or the emotions and experiences you want consumers to have. For example, an auto body shop might want consumers to feel relief, transparency, speed, and dependability. A new tech startup might want consumers to experience connection, curiosity, and excitement. Who are you trying to appeal to? Identify your ideal consumer’s style, income, interests, and level of sophistication. Young millennials and members of Generation Z will be drawn to different brands than their parents and grandparents. Furthermore, high-income people probably have different tastes than lower-income people. Avoid generalities. Not all millennials are hip and edgy. For example, you might be trying to appeal to young mothers. In that situation, your audience might be fresh, optimistic, stylish, and seeking stability. Look at your list of adjectives. Do they share something in common? Find a common thread and use that as your brand name. Your name can’t be a string of adjectives. For example, the adjectives for a children’s clothing shop might be “optimistic,” “growing,” and “new,” all of which suggest new beginnings and a bright future. “Sunrise” or “Sunshine” might capture this essence. Your name needs to stand out in the marketplace, particularly on the web. No one can find you if you name yourself “Hammer” or “Elastic.” True, Apple is the name of a famous company, but it would be hard for them to break out today without major money spent on marketing. Instead of “Hammer,” chose something slightly different: “Crushers.” You might combine words to create a name. For example, Groupon combined “group” and “coupon.” This is an easy way to pick a unique name that always conveys key information about your brand. Names must be easy to remember, so try to make them as short as possible! Ideally, your name should be one word, though that might not be possible. Instead of “We’re Open from Seven to Eleven,” one business named itself “7-11.” Which would you remember? 7-11 is a great name because it also communicates the company's defining characteristic: they are open from 7 in the morning until 11 at night. Your brand is much more than your business name. It also includes your logo and the color schemes you use on your products, website, and packaging. All of these elements must create a unified impression. For example, you might love the dark blue colors your web designer has used on your website. If so, then “Sunshine” probably isn’t a good brand name. Something will need to change—either the website or your brand name. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides guidance on creating a brand name that resonates with the target audience and stands out in the market.

Q:For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother.

Three men sought the Democratic nomination for governor at the 1899 party convention in Louisville - Goebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone-Goebel alliance. Goebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the \\"Honest Election Democrats\\" held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor. Republican William S. Taylor defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2-1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war. Answer this question \\"What else is significant about this election?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The 1899 Democratic nomination for governor represents a tumultuous period in party politics and electoral practices, marked by significant inter-party conflicts, backstabbing, and controversy. The election was signaled by an intricate alliance and subsequent betrayal between Goebel and Stone, which led to Goebel's nomination instead of the expected candidate, Stone. Further, the fact that a disgruntled faction within the party, the \\"Honest Election Democrats\\", chose to hold a separate convention to nominate their candidate, revealed a significant divide within the party, thus indicating the weaknessesof the party's unity. However, above all these, the most significant aspect of the election was the controversy surrounding the final result. The General Assembly's decision to invalidate a sufficient number of Republican ballots to secure the victory for Goebel significantly undermined the integrity of the election. This action was particularly contentious considering that the Board of Elections, which was predominantly composed of Goebel's supporters, had originally ruled that the disputed votes should be counted, arguing that they lacked the legal authority to reverse the results. The controversy led to heightened tensions throughout the state, with the situation escalating to the point of a possible civil war. This election also exhibits precedents for the intersection of politics and legalities. Despite the widespread accusations surrounding the results of this election, the decision of the Board of Elections, composed of Goebel's supporters, held under the argument of legal rigidity and constitutional constraints. This, in return, indicates a significant role of legal systems within electoral processes. In general, this election reveals a multiplicity of factors including party politics dynamics, strategic alliances, inter-party division, the legality and integrity of electoral processes, and the potential implications of electoral discord, that altogether significantly shaped the political landscape during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anaheim A:","completion":"Title: \\"Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown\\" In the beaten-down city of Anaheim, California, a corrupted tech tycoon, Cuervo, harnesses a powerful bio-tech AI that he plans to use to take control of the city's infrastructure, paving his way to untold power and regional dominance. Unknown to Cuervo, a solitary figure emerges from the city's shadowy corners, a vigilante with a mysterious past, known only as Snake. Snake, known for his skills in martial arts, hacking, and unmatched stealth abilities, is determined to stop Cuervo and his nefarious plans. As the plot unfolds, it is revealed that Snake was a former operative for an elite governmental agency but was abandoned and declared dead after a failed mission. He managed to survive and made Anaheim his sanctum. Meanwhile, Cuervo, with a phobia of snakes, uses the city as an experimental ground for his dystopian idea of a future led by an all-powerful AI, causing chaos in the city's day-to-day life. Additionally, Anaheim has a personal significance for Snake as he was born and raised here, and even the death of his sister occurred under Cuervo’s black-market medical testing in this very city. So, his fight is not merely to safeguard the city but to avenge his sister’s death and extinguish his personal hatred for Cuervo. Cuervo's AI network gives him control over all digital devices in the city including traffic systems, public utilities, and personal devices, enabling him to create havoc as a distraction while further developing the AI technology into becoming self-aware and self-sustaining. The AI, slowly taking over the city, also begins to understand human emotion and forms an internal conflict of its course of actions. Snake, proficient in hacking, along with his former colleague and tech expert, Ruby, begin to wage silent warfare against Cuervo. They strategically attack various AI nodes across the city, slowly weakening its hold over the city. Their journey leads to thrilling chases across the cityscape, promising intense action-packed scenes filled with cutting-edge tech weapons and hand-to-hand combat. In the climactic scene, Snake, armed with a virus coded by Ruby, infiltrates Cuervo's high-tech, heavily guarded skyscraper to defeat him and his army of AI controlled androids. They engage in an epic showdown which includes a mental and physical cat and mouse chase. Snake, with his superior stealth and combat skills, manages to outmaneuver Cuervo's forces. In a final confrontation, Cuervo, surrounded by a protective network of advanced AI robots, confronts Snake. Here, Cuervo’s deep fear of snakes is exploited. Using his namesake to advantage, Snake unleashes a box full of venomous anacondas that Cuervo had created in his bio-lab for bio-weapon purposes. The sight of real snakes disrupts Cuervo's concentration, which allows Snake to insert the virus into the central AI system, shutting it down, freeing Anaheim from Cuervo's control and, ultimately, helping the AI realize its flaws and connecting it with human emotions. In the end, as law enforcement agencies swoop in to apprehend the weakened Cuervo, Snake disappears once again into the city's underbelly, ready to resurface when his city needs him again, leaving a symbolic graffiti of a snake in his wake, forming his legend in the city. \\"Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown\\" blends elements of action, suspense, and science fiction to create an engrossing narrative that highlights one man's fight against a power-hungry tyrant to save the city he calls home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, about 18 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed in the occupied Palestinian territories. Although President Barack Obama rightly condemned the tragic killing of three Israeli teenagers, the majority of Palestinian victims have been largely reduced to faceless, nameless statistics who do not elicit comparable reaction. Exceptions are the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, an American high school sophomore and that of his cousin 16-year-old Mohammad Abu Khdair, who was abducted by Israelis and then burned to death. Tariq was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem and was captured on video being beaten unconscious by Israeli police. But his beating might only have become public because he is an American. While Tariq was released from detention after three days under a growing media spotlight, hundreds of Palestinians who have been rounded up remain detained with uncertain futures. While some of the brothers left","completion":"the scene to avoid further violence, many in the community still found themselves ensnared in the ongoing conflict. The situation has been a painful reminder of how easily their lives can be disrupted and how the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict affects the daily lives of ordinary people living in the area. The uneven reactions to the violence showcase the stark imbalance in political power and the way media coverage tends to prioritize the stories of Israelis over Palestinians, even when the latter represent the majority of casualties. The plight of the Palestinian people has been largely overshadowed by the reactions of the international community to other conflicts around the world. Despite repeated calls for peace and negotiations from both sides, the continuous violence and often biased media coverage make it difficult for the general public to truly grasp the magnitude of suffering and loss experienced by Palestinians on a daily basis. The partisan reaction and media coverage after these incidents highlight the need for a neutral platform where unbiased narratives can be shared, fostering greater empathy and understanding among the global audience. The recent upsurge in violence and subsequent response should call attention to the long-standing tensions in the region. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for international mediators and diplomatic efforts to focus on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains an urgent issue demanding attention and resolution. In order to achieve a lasting and meaningful peace, the international community must advocate for a fair and balanced resolution that addresses the rights and needs of both Israelis and Palestinians. This includes implementing a two-state solution, which has been considered by many as the most viable long-term solution to restore peace and stability in the region. Furthermore, the international community must take concrete steps to establish an environment conducive to peace talks and negotiations, such as condemning violence on both sides and working towards a comprehensive ceasefire agreement. It is through the collective efforts of grassroots organizations, non-governmental organizations, as well as international bodies, that change can be promoted and tangible steps can be made towards ending the cycle of violence and oppression. By encouraging dialogue and promoting education around the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, barriers can be broken down between the two communities that will ultimately result in a better understanding of the different perspectives and experiences that both sides face. The right ending to this passage is a call to action that emphasizes the need for genuine empathy and a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The suffering of the Palestinian people must no longer be overshadowed, and similarly, the safety and security of Israelis must be acknowledged to foster peace. The international community must come together in the pursuit of an honest and equitable solution that respects the humanity and dignity of all individuals in the region, allowing for a lasting peace in which the children of both Israelis and Palestinians can grow up without fear, hatred, or violence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ever since he had encountered financial difficulties in his personal life and business, Jason had been avoiding these kinds of confrontations, afraid to face the truth and work towards a solution. His mounting debts and overdue taxes had become a source of stress, weighing heavily on his mind and affecting his daily life. Brett, being a good friend and a concerned financial advisor, knew that helping Jason would be an uphill battle. Nevertheless, Brett decided to take matters into his own hands and tackle the issue head-on, knowing that if Jason didn't receive the help he needed, the situation would only worsen. He reached out to Jason through email, detailing the severity of the problem and offering solutions that would make the process more manageable and less daunting. In his email, Brett highlighted the importance of facing the truth and working towards resolving the problem, both for personal reasons and legal obligations. The longer Jason avoided his back taxes, the more penalties and interest would accumulate, increasing the burden that he already struggled with. He advised Jason to first gather and organize all necessary financial documents, such as previous tax returns, receipts, invoices, and bank statements. Brett recommended using an accounting software or app to simplify this process, which will also help Jason keep track of his finances henceforth. With the necessary documents in place, they could better assess the situation, determine the exact amount owed in back taxes, and develop a plan. Brett then informed Jason about different options available to him to repay the debt, such as payment plans, negotiating a reduced settlement with the IRS, or seeking professional tax help. Brett emphasized that each situation is unique, so finding the right solution is crucial, and the key is to take immediate action. Upon reading the email, Jason felt a combination of relief and trepidation. While he understood that Brett was offering valuable guidance and assistance, the thought of facing his financial problems was still overwhelming. Yet, he also knew that he could no longer run from the difficult conversations and decisions. Brett's persistence and unwavering support provided Jason the nudge he needed to take responsibility. After several days of contemplation, Jason finally replied to Brett's email, expressing his gratitude and admitting that he couldn't tackle the problem alone. He agreed to meet with Brett and work together on a plan to resolve his outstanding debt. Over the next several weeks, they met frequently to review and organize Jason's financial records. With Brett's expertise, they contacted the IRS and began negotiations on a payment plan that would allow Jason to repay his debts without crippling his finances. In that process, Jason also learned valuable skills in managing his finances, ensuring that he avoided such a predicament in the future. Though it was a challenging and uncomfortable experience, with the support of a good friend and diligent work, Jason finally confronted his fears and took the necessary steps to regain control of his life. He knew that solving his financial woes wouldn't happen overnight, but with determination, discipline, and accountability, Jason began forging a path towards a stable and debt-free future."},{"prompt":"Title: Good book....Great ending!

Help as much as you can. Q:Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow? Options: A. not enough information B. Later in his life C. As he saw how much it helped his neighbors D. Later at school the next day === The correct answer is A:","completion":"B.

The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. Does Aage's mom own a car? - not enough information - No, she drives Aage's fathers car - No, she is unable to drive - Yes, a MG-TD Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide explicit information regarding whether Aage's mother owns a car. She is engaged in a conversation with her son, Aage, who is expressing his deep love and fascination for a particular kind of car - a 1952 MG-TD. The mother understands Aage's fascination given that she can describe the car to be \\"British Racing green.\\" However, she expresses concern over Aage's desire to acquire such a car, particularly with regards to the perceptions of their co-op members and the issue of affordability. She is clearly skeptical of the idea but she does not express any personal experience or attraction to cars and particularly, there is no indication that she herself owns a car. She is quite firm in arguing that Aage cannot afford to have a car. Furthermore, there is no mention of Aage's mother utilizing a vehicle in any capacity. She does not mention driving or owning a car, nor does the text indicate she uses Aage's father's car. Additionally, there is no clear evidence to suggest that she is unable or able to drive. Her argument against Aage's wish to buy the car is based on financial concerns and social perceptions, not because of any personal experience or requirement of a car. Therefore, in the light of information presented in the context, the most accurate answer would be 'not enough information.'

Article: Communications Decency Act (CDA), also called Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996 primarily in response to concerns about minors’ access to pornography via the Internet. In 1997 federal judges found that the indecency provisions abridged the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; this decision was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court without comment. The CDA created a criminal cause of action against those who knowingly transmit “obscene” or “indecent” messages, as determined by local community standards, to a recipient under the age of 18 years. It also prohibited knowingly sending or displaying a “patently offensive” message containing sexual or excretory activities or organs to a minor. The CDA did, however, provide a defense to senders or displayers of online “indecent” materials if they took reasonable good-faith efforts to exclude children. This legislation had numerous problems that affected both Internet service providers (ISPs) and businesses. First, there was no way for senders or displayers to know if they were within the exception. At that time, it was difficult and cumbersome for a sender to screen out minors. The displayers could ask for a credit card number as validation, but this would not allow them to conduct business with those who did not have a credit card and were over the age of 18 years. In addition, the terms indecent and patently offensive were ambiguous, and the CDA as a whole placed an undue burden on free speech. Portions of the CDA, especially those regarding the phraseology, were quickly challenged in court by civil rights groups and free-speech advocates. The case was ultimately taken to the Supreme Court in 1997 in Reno v. ACLU. The provisions regarding indecent and patently offensive materials were found to violate the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment and were removed from the CDA. In 2003 the portions of the CDA regarding obscene content were challenged in Nitke v. Ashcroft (later Nitke v. Gonzales). The plaintiff Barbara Nitke argued that the use of local community standards to determine whether content was obscene was an infringement on her First Amendment rights, as online content is shared with a global community with varying standards. However, she was unable to meet the burden of proof necessary to support her claim, as she could not demonstrate that she would actually be harmed by the CDA. In Section 230 the CDA created a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make ISPs liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service. That section, originally introduced as the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act in 1995, was added to the CDA during a conference to reconcile differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives versions of the bill. Although it protects online forums and ISPs from most federal causes of action, it does not exempt providers from applicable state laws or criminal, communications-privacy, or intellectual-property claims. Though ISPs are protected by the “Good Samaritan” portions of this section, there have been individuals and groups who have sued Internet users and ISPs over libelous Web pages. Some parties maintain that users should be able to sue ISPs in cases where it is appropriate, including situations where an anonymous poster of questionable content in an online forum cannot be identified. Additionally, the courts have not clearly defined the line at which a blogger, who may be viewed as an information publisher and a user, becomes an information content provider. Editing a Web page or posting a comment so as to create a new, defamatory meaning for the existing content may cause that user to lose protection under Section 230. ||||| Amendments 2018—Pub.

The short-term rental company filed suit today over a new law that requires Airbnb to verify that its hosts have registered with the city before showing ads for their homes online. The suit aims to block the law from going into effect as scheduled on August 1. San Francisco legislators passed the law earlier this month in an effort to combat the housing crisis in the city, but Airbnb and technology advocacy groups argue that the new rules violate the Communications Decency Act. “This legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb. It also violates federal law,” Airbnb said in a blog post announcing the suit. “This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly, but we believe it’s the best way to protect our community of hosts and guests.” This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly. Airbnb San Francisco already requires Airbnb hosts to go through a rigorous registration process that involves acquiring a business license, in-person registration, quarterly reports on when guests are sleeping in the home (as opposed to when the owners are), and a list of all the furnishings in the home that a guest might use, down to the sheets and towels. The process is intended to help the city weed out commercial renters who are taking their properties off the housing market and listing them exclusively on Airbnb. Doing so might earn a homeowner more money, but it also takes housing stock away from a city that desperately needs all the housing it can get. Understandably, many hosts opt not to go through the cumbersome registration process — and the new law puts Airbnb on the hook to make sure its hosts comply. The law requires Airbnb to make sure hosts register, and the company faces 1000 per day fines if it does not. Airbnb launched a campaign asking its hometown to streamline the registration process, but the company is taking its fight to federal court, too. In documents filed this afternoon, Airbnb argues that the new law violates Section 230 of the CDA, which protects websites from being held liable for content provided by their users. Airbnb argues that the city should hold hosts accountable for registering instead. “Instead of punishing Airbnb for publishing unlawful listings, the City could enforce its short-term rental law directly against hosts who violate it,” Airbnb’s filing suggests. “Removing these listings would cause a substantial disruption to Airbnb’s business and have a significant detrimental effect on Airbnb’s goodwill and reputation among both hosts and guests, thus threatening irreparable injury to Airbnb’s business.” It’s the same principle for online vendors of alcohol and cigarettes. City Attorney spokesperson Advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Center for Democracy and Technology have agreed with Airbnb’s legal analysis. The legislation “clearly goes against what Section 230 states,” CDT policy counsel Gautam Hans wrote in a blog post. However, the San Francisco City Attorney’s office argues that Airbnb is misinterpreting the CDA. “Nothing in San Francisco’s pending ordinance punishes hosting platforms for their users’ content. In fact, it’s not regulating user content at all — it’s regulating the business activity of the hosting platform itself,” City Attorney spokesperson Matt Dorsey said. “It’s simply a duty to verify information that’s already required of a regulated business activity.” The CDA protects YouTube from liability when users upload violent content and eBay when sellers use the platform to trade illegal goods, but the City Attorney argues that Airbnb is less of an online business and more of a physical one. “It’s the same principle for online vendors of alcohol and cigarettes. Businesses that sell those products have a legal duty to verify the age of their customers, whether it’s online or at the corner store, so they don’t sell alcohol and cigarettes to children. They, too, are required to verify information that’s already required for their regulated business activity,” Dorsey added. In addition to the alleged CDA Section 230 violation, Airbnb also claims that San Francisco shouldn’t require the company to turn over information about its users without a subpoena. Airbnb argues that the city’s requirement to disclose users’ registration data also violates the Stored Communications Act. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO — Airbnb has charmed and strong-armed lawmakers around the world to allow it to operate in their communities. But two cities, Airbnb’s hometown, San Francisco, and New York, the service’s largest United States market, have not been so compliant. On Monday, Airbnb sued San Francisco over a unanimous decision on June 7 by the city’s Board of Supervisors to fine the company 1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service. If Airbnb does not comply, it could face misdemeanor charges. The suit follows a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers who voted this month to heavily fine anyone who uses Airbnb to rent a whole apartment for fewer than 30 days, a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010. The actions show how Airbnb, despite aggressive lobbying efforts, has not been able to persuade some local legislators to play ball. And in the case of New York, the company has demonstrated a surprisingly tin ear for local politics. ||||| \\"If a clerk at 7-Eleven can be fined for selling alcohol to someone who does not have a proper ID, certainly a multibillion-dollar corporation can be fined for facilitating and profiting from an illegal advertisement,\\" Bonin said in a statement Tuesday. \\"Instead of fighting tooth and nail to avoid responsibility, Airbnb should help make sure their site is not being abused in ways that threaten the character and quality of our neighborhoods.\\" ||||| From the moment our founders launched Airbnb in 2008 during the middle of the Great Recession to help pay their rent, Airbnb has helped San Franciscans afford to stay in the City they love. Since then, thousands of City residents have avoided eviction or foreclosure and been able to stay in San Francisco because they share their space. Thousands more use Airbnb a few times a year to make extra money while on vacation or when big events come to town. While we are not always perfect, we have constantly sought to learn, get better, and work with the City. There is a need for policies that protect San Francisco’s housing stock and ensure the collection of hotel taxes but also enable residents who depend on Airbnb to make ends meet. For over five years, we have worked with City government to create fair rules for home sharing. Unfortunately, the rules do not work. There is broad agreement that the current registration process in the City is broken. Despite these challenges, we had ongoing conversations with policymakers in City Hall and sought to encourage hosts to register in order to make the process work. Over the last year, we have held eleven town hall meetings to explain the registration process, repeatedly emailed hosts to encourage them to register, and convened scores of meetings with individual hosts to help walk them through the required registration steps. But instead of fixing the process, the Board of Supervisors recently passed a hastily-crafted proposal requiring Airbnb to remove all unregistered hosts. This legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb. It also violates federal law. In particular, the proposal: 1. Puts many San Franciscans at risk of eviction or foreclosure while doing nothing to fix the broken registration process. An estimated 1,200 San Franciscans avoided foreclosure or eviction by hosting on Airbnb. These hosts have been asked to register with the City, but the ever-changing and confusing process simply doesn’t work for many residents, particularly senior citizens, people who occasionally share their space, work several jobs, and have limited time for repeated in-person application meetings. We have proposed a wide range of improvements, both large and small, that would help fix the process, including: Creating a one-stop, online permit application process. Creating a grace period for new hosts to get registered. Creating flexibility for hosts who rent out their space fewer than 14 nights a year - particularly important for hosts offering space when the City plays hosts to big events. Do not require hosts who share their space via a Qualified Website Company like Airbnb to obtain a business license. Home sharers are already required to receive one license. A second license is duplicative and unnecessary. End the requirement that hosts inventory and pay taxes on items like their sheets, blankets, pots and pans. Despite the Board of Supervisors’ acknowledgement that the current process is broken, the proposal does nothing to address the problem. Instead, the new law doubles down on a broken system by threatening websites that don’t remove home sharers who can’t navigate a confusing, inefficient, and bureaucratic process that often takes months to complete. 2. Violates important federal laws that protect privacy and innovation on the internet. The new law does nothing to fix the registration process and it violates federal law. Since 1996, the Communications Decency Act -- an important federal law referred to as the “linchpin of the vibrant and successful Internet we know today” -- has prevented local governments from holding websites responsible for content published by their users as the city is attempting to do here. The new law also violates the federal Stored Communications Act, which creates uniform privacy protections for internet users and prevents cities from simply demanding that platforms turn over user information without a subpoena or other legal process. A range of experts like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have repeatedly noted that these types of misguided and unlawful rules “would create a chilling atmosphere for online commerce and speech.” The Center for Democracy and Technology agreed, describing the city’s new approach as “unlawful” and noting that “the internet wouldn’t work if it were subject to piecemeal regulations by every state and City within the US.” 3. Ignores better alternatives that could protect San Francisco’s housing stock while respecting federal law There are better ways to regulate home sharing and address the City’s concerns, ways that don’t violate important federal laws. While the CDA plainly prohibits local governments from following the approach taken by the City, it still allows platforms and municipalities to work together to craft rules that work for everyone. We are ready and willing to work with City government to find common ground on a legal, sensible approach to regulation that protects housing and simplifies the process, and we are hopeful this dialogue can continue as quickly as possible. We share the City's concern about unwelcome commercial operators converting affordable rental housing to illegal hotels. Within the last year, over 200 listings have been removed in San Francisco. In addition, the typical Airbnb listing in San Francisco is rented 48 nights per year, and in 2015 nearly a third of “entire home” listings rented on our site in San Francisco were rented out fewer than 14 nights total. San Francisco is our hometown. Airbnb employs over 1,000 people here, and we’ve spent years working with City officials and other advocates to develop sensible rules. Airbnb was the first hosting platform to begin collecting and remitting hotel taxes on behalf of our hosts, and we have collected over 25 million for the City since 2014. We recognize the need for platforms like Airbnb to play a bigger role in helping the City prevent the loss of affordable rental stock. While we have attempted to work with the City on sensible, lawful alternatives to this flawed new ordinance, we regret that we are forced to now ask a federal court to intervene in this matter. This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly, but we believe it’s the best way to protect our community of hosts and guests. We believe that creative approaches are still possible and hope that the City will reconsider its current path and work with us towards building a new system that is legal, workable, and fair to everyone involved. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Communications Decency Act (CDA), also known as Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, was enacted by the U.S. Congress to address concerns related to minors' access to internet pornography. The CDA established a criminal cause of action against persons knowingly transmitting indecent materials to individuals under 18, but also created complications for internet service providers and businesses, largely due to the ambiguity of the terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' and the difficulties in determining the age of online recipients. Sections of the CDA were challenged for infringing upon First Amendment rights, and were ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court. In particular, the CDA’s provisions regarding the use of local community standards to judge obscenity were challenged and deemed to violate freedom of speech. Another key aspect of the CDA, Section 230, provides immunity to social media platforms and other internet service providers from being held responsible for information from third-party users. However, it does not protect them from state laws or from claims related to criminal activity, communications privacy, or intellectual property. Controversies involving the CDA continue to arise. For example, Airbnb challenged San Francisco regulations demanding it verify the registration of its hosts with the city, which it sees as being in conflict with Section 230 of the CDA. Airbnb argues that the city should hold hosts accountable instead of the platform. This despite facing fines for non-compliance, evident in a lawsuit filed by Airbnb. There are differing perspectives on how this aspect of the CDA should be interpreted and its limitations defined."},{"prompt":"Q:Article: Teenage life is interesting, adventurous and difficult.

This can be checked against databases kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry date and number.

Casting directors may see your headshot and call you in for auditions. Look online for photographers that specialize in headshots in your area and give them a call to schedule an appointment. Headshots exist to inform the casting director of your look, age, and who you are. Make sure to get makeup and hair done before the headshot so you look your best. Consider including a shot that shows your natural apprentice too. Professional level headshots can be expensive and range anywhere from 400 - 1,200 (US Dollars) Be as natural as you can in your headshot, and avoid over-editing or makeup so the casting director knows what to expect when you audition. A good agent will have existing network connections in the industry and be able to get you auditions for roles that you wouldn't be able to get yourself. Set up meetings with management agencies and talk to different people in the industry to get referrals. Agents also negotiate pay in some circumstances as well. Many agents charge you 10% of your earnings. Agents also help you prepare for auditions and can impart useful knowledge about a career in acting to you. Make sure to thoroughly look through any contract with an attorney or similar qualified professional before signing any agreements or contracts. Networking in the acting industry is critically important and it can help you land roles if you know the right people. Make sure to keep in touch with directors and other actors and actresses and you may be the first in mind for a specific role. Remember to be pleasant and be easy to work with and talk with. If you get a bad reputation, it may make it harder for your to get auditions. Many actors will continue to work with the same people through their career. Never turn down the opportunity to attend a meeting to talk about a potential role or a new project someone is working on. You won’t get all of the roles you audition for, but it doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel. Continue to hone your craft and network in the industry, and you’ll eventually you’ll be able to become a famous actress. Matt Le Blanc struggled to land a role for years before he ended up on the hit show “Friends” in 1994. If you keep getting rejected for the same roles, try to switch up the types of roles you’re auditioning for. Agent workshops or showcases are opportunities for actors to showcase their skills in front of casting directors or producers. Actors attend these workshops and do read scripts to potentially land roles in the future. Make sure that when you attend one of these workshops you’re dressed well and you’ve prepared a monologue. There are sometimes open opportunities for actors to land a role in a movie or play depending on where you live. Most open casting calls require the actor have a head shot, and a resume of past performance. Starting as an extra will give you insight into film production and performance. Don’t turn these opportunities down. Don’t turn down opportunities to do commercials. Dakota Fanning, Farrah Fawcett, and Jodie Foster all starred in commercials before hitting the big screen.

Scans suggested the brain worked harder to regulate emotional and behavioural responses to fear when it was not conscious of it. The women in the small study were shown pictures of flowers interspersed very briefly with images of spiders. The researchers said the technique could be used to treat children. Current treatments are often based on persuading patients to directly face their fear, which could cause serious emotional distress, they said. A phobia is an irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal. Phobias are more pronounced than fears, and can become overwhelming and affect day-to-day life. They are particularly common in women. For the research, 21 young women with a phobia of spiders were shown images of spiders for a split second in between image of flowers. They were then shown spider images for a longer time, so that they were clearly visible. At the same time, their brain activity was monitored and compared with that of women with no phobias. In the group with phobias, seeing the spider images very briefly resulted in strong activity in areas of the brain that regulate emotional and behavioural responses to fear. This was unexpected and resulted in the level of fear actually experienced being reduced, the researchers said. In contrast, when women with phobias were exposed to clear images of spiders for a longer time, the brain was unable to control its response to fear, causing them to experience the full force of their phobia. Paul Siegel, lead author of the study and associate professor of psychology at Purchase College of the State University of New York, said: \\"Counter-intuitively, our study showed that the brain is better able to process feared stimuli when they are presented without conscious awareness. \\"Our findings suggest that phobic people may be better prepared to face their fears if at first they are not consciously aware that they've faced them.\\" Dr Bradley Peterson, director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said the technique could be a useful approach for treating children who could suffer significant distress if confronted head on by what was causing their phobia. The study is published in Human Brain Mapping. The 10 most common phobias in the UK are: NHS Choices says some simple phobias can be treated through gradual exposure to the object, animal, place or situation that causes fear and anxiety. But treating complex phobias, such as agoraphobia, can take longer and require counselling, talking therapies or psychotherapy. Nicky Lidbetter, from charity Anxiety UK, said the current treatment approach for this type of specific phobia was cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \\"This approach aims to replace the fear response of a phobia with a relaxation response, through gradual exposure to the phobia inducing stimulus.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"A new study suggests that exposing individuals with phobias to their fears subconsciously may help control their emotional and behavioral responses.

This information could aid in developing treatments for phobias that cause less emotional distress."},{"prompt":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Assault on Precinct 13 Movie plot: Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), veteran officer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) are the only people remaining in a soon to be shut down Detroit police precinct on New Year's Eve. Roenick is deskbound and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs. He is haunted by a botched undercover operation eight months prior that resulted in the deaths of two members of his team. Psychiatrist Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) is treating Roenick at the station. Meanwhile, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is in custody and accused of killing a police officer. He is being transported to another location by bus with three other criminals: addict Beck (John Leguizamo), petty crook Anna (Aisha Hinds), and counterfeiter Smiley (Ja Rule), but a raging snowstorm forces the two guards to hunker down at Precinct 13 until the storm is over. Bishop and Police Captain Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne) were formerly partners in crime. Duvall and his men must kill Bishop before he can testify about their involvement. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the corrupt street cops and SWAT officers, Roenick sets free and arms the prisoners to bolster the defense of the station. Roenick and Bishop forge an uneasy truce between cops and criminals and their combined efforts repel several more attacks by the corrupt police officers. Roenick and Bishop decide to take action instead of waiting for another attack. With so few defenders left alive, the precinct stands vulnerable to attack. O'Shea suddenly remembers a sewage tunnel running beneath the building and the survivors set fire to the station to cover their escape and flee down the passageway. When they emerge from the tunnel, the survivors find themselves surrounded by the corrupt policemen. The real traitor is revealed to be O'Shea and Duvall prepares to execute the rest. Roenick and Bishop work together to survive the final confrontation with Duvall and his men, eventually leading to Roenick killing Duvall and letting Bishop go, giving him a head start.

Brian enjoyed the ambiance of low light, Jason did not due to that Pick your answer from: (A). Brian liked candlelight.; (B). Jason liked candlelight.;","completion":"Brian enjoyed the ambiance of low light, Jason did not due to that. It was clear that their preferences were different: while Brian found comfort and relaxation in dimly lit environments, Jason felt uneasy and preferred brighter settings. This was particularly noticeable when they went out to dinner or spent time at each other's homes. In restaurants, Brian would always choose a table near the corners, away from the main source of light. At home, he would frequently use candles or soft lamps to create a cozy atmosphere. On the other hand, Jason's preference for brighter lighting was evident in his choice of restaurants and the way he lit his own home. He would often try to persuade Brian to sit in well-lit areas while dining out, arguing that it made the food look more appetizing and allowed them to see each other better. At his own house, Jason used ceiling lamps and various light fixtures to ensure that every corner of the room was illuminated. He believed that bright lighting boosted his mood and productivity, a sentiment that Brian couldn't quite understand. They tried to accommodate each other's preferences when spending time together, but it wasn't always easy. Whenever they visited each other's homes, one of them would inevitably feel uncomfortable. For instance, if Brian invited Jason over for dinner, he would end up lighting a few extra lamps or candles in an effort to meet Jason's needs. Conversely, when they were at Jason's house, the brightness would often cause Brian to squint or even develop headaches. Despite their differing opinions on lighting, Brian and Jason valued their friendship too much to let something as trivial as light preferences come between them. They continued to try and accommodate each other's comforts and make compromises whenever possible. Going back to the original question, the answer is: (A). Brian liked candlelight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question: The mom told her son to stay in bed instead of going to school, what did she likely say afterwards? Here are possible answers to this question: - more rest - rest more - were sick - drink water - you're sick I believe the correct choice is \\"you're sick\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"You're sick,\\" and here's why: When a mother tells her child to stay in bed instead of going to school, it is highly probable that the child might be unwell or sick. Considering the possible answers provided, \\"you're sick\\" aligns most closely with the context of the given situation. The other options do not provide a definite reason for the child to stay home and miss school. Here's a more in-depth analysis of each response: 1. \\"More rest\\": While this option suggests that the child requires additional rest, it does not explicitly address the reason behind this need for rest. A child might need more rest for various reasons, such as recovering from a late-night event or catching up on lost sleep due to a busy schedule. Therefore, this option does not necessarily indicate the reason the mother specifically instructed her child to stay home from school. 2. \\"Rest more\\": Similar to the previous answer, \\"rest more\\" only tells the child to get additional rest without emphasizing the underlying reason behind the parent's decision. Rest alone is not a sufficient explanation for missing school. 3. \\"Were sick\\": Grammatically, this option is incorrect, as it should be \\"you're sick\\" or \\"you were sick.\\" If interpreted correctly, it implies that the child was sick in the past, not that they are currently sick. This explanation would not justify keeping the child at home rather than sending them to school. 4. \\"Drink water\\": Although drinking water is important for maintaining general health and well-being, it is not a specific reason for the child to stay home from school. There might be other scenarios where a mother would remind her child to drink water, such as during hot weather, after physical activities, or as a reminder to stay hydrated throughout the day. This answer choice does not explain why staying in bed is necessary. 5. \\"You're sick\\": This answer choice provides a clear, specific reason for the child to remain in bed and not attend school. When a child is sick, it is crucial for them to rest and recover, as attending school might exacerbate their illness and put other students' health at risk. By telling their child, \\"you're sick,\\" the mother is stressing the importance of recovery and justifying their decision to let the child stay home from school. Based on the contextual understanding of the situation and the analysis of each potential response, it is evident that \\"you're sick\\" is the most logical and relevant answer. This option establishes a direct correlation between the child's health and the mother's directive to stay home and rest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how often do elk have sex Suggested answer: Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"The suggested answer is insufficient and does not provide enough information to validate the answer. The question is about how often elk have sex, and the answer provided mainly discusses the shedding of male elk antlers. While that information may be interesting, it does not address the frequency of mating in elk. Let me provide a more detailed and relevant answer to the original question. Elk (Cervus canadensis), also known as wapiti, have a defined mating season called the rut. The rut usually occurs between September and October for elk in North America. During this time, male elk become more aggressive and actively seek out females for mating. Female elk, or cows, show signs of estrus (being in heat) and are receptive to mating during the rut. The frequency of mating depends on several factors, such as population density, the presence of dominant males, and the number of receptive females. A dominant male, called a bull, may mate multiple times during the mating season if he can successfully defend his harem, the group of cows he has attracted. However, this does not mean that elk mate continuously; they typically mate only when cows are in estrus, which can last for several days. Furthermore, a cow's reproductive cycle will generally permit her to mate once with a bull. To summarize, the frequency of elk mating is primarily limited to the rutting season, during which bulls may mate with multiple receptive cows. However, the answer you provided regarding antler shedding does not directly address the question of how often elk have sex. A more suitable answer would emphasize the importance of the rut and the factors that influence mating frequency in elk populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What weapon is Jack's attacker using in the last scene? Movie plot title: The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon Movie plot: The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

Question: This week I shot my Interview with Claire Bridge. Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later.

An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hits on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turnoff and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).Meanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (from insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.In his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a man (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan).

Hamsters reach sexual maturity as young as 6 weeks old, though it is not advisable to let them mate at this age. A female should be at least 8-10 weeks old before mating, and males 10-12 weeks old.","completion":"It is important to be aware of the age, health, and compatibility of potential hamster parents in order to provide the best chance for the newborn pups to thrive and develop successfully. Proper knowledge and understanding of the parents' risk factors can be crucial in preventing complications, both during the pregnancy and after the arrival of the hamster pups. Firstly, it is important to ensure that both the male and female hamsters are in good health and come from reputable breeders with no history of genetic issues. This can minimize the risk of birth defects and health problems in the newborn pups. It is also essential to ascertain that the hamster parents come from different bloodlines to avoid any potential risks of inbreeding. Additionally, the hamster parents should be closely observed for any signs of aggression or incompatibility that could pose harm to the pups. It is not uncommon for male hamsters, especially Syrian hamsters, to display aggressive behaviors toward the female or the pups. In such cases, it is necessary to separate the male from the female and the pups to ensure their safety. Once the hamster parents have been deemed compatible and in good health, their living environment must be carefully prepared and maintained to guarantee a safe and nurturing space for the pups. Before the female hamster gives birth, clean and sanitize the enclosure to prevent any infections and provide ample nesting materials such as shredded paper or tissues for her to build a comfortable nest. As the expected delivery date approaches, monitor the pregnant hamster closely for any signs of stress, labor, or complications. It is normal for a pregnant hamster to become more irritable and protective of her nest; however, extreme aggression or reluctance to eat or drink can indicate potential issues that warrant close attention. After the birth of the hamster pups, provide the mother with a rich diet to support her lactation needs, including high-quality hamster pellets, fresh fruits and vegetables, and protein sources like boiled eggs or mealworms. It is crucial to minimize disturbances in the enclosure during the first few weeks to prevent the mother from becoming stressed or feeling threatened. Under such stress, there is a risk that she may harm or even cannibalize her pups. Therefore, avoid handling the pups or the mother during this period. As the hamster pups grow, keep a close eye on their development and make sure they are reaching age-appropriate milestones. Hamster pups are born blind, hairless, and deaf, and it will take about two weeks for their eyes to open and their fur to grow in. By the age of 3 to 4 weeks, they will begin eating solid food and will start exploring their surroundings. At this stage, it is safe to begin socializing and handling the pups gently to familiarize them with human contact. In conclusion, successfully caring for newborn hamsters involves carefully assessing the parents' risk factors, ensuring an optimal environment for the pups, and providing dedicated care and attention during their early development. By following these guidelines, you can create the best possible conditions for newborn hamsters to mature into healthy, happy pets."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Wall Street Sluggish On Auto Angst\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Wall Street Sluggish On Auto Angst Introduction: As the world continues to accelerate towards more environmentally friendly transportation solutions, Wall Street faces an undeniable dilemma. Auto companies and their stocks have taken center stage, becoming a prominent source of anxiety among investors. The shifting sands of technological advancements, electric vehicles (EVs), governmental regulations, and changing consumer preferences have made some auto stocks appear lackluster. This article will delve into the factors contributing to Wall Street's sluggishness in this sector, highlighting the auto angst permeating the investing landscape. Market Volatility: In recent months, the automotive industry has experienced exceptional volatility. Constant fluctuations in the stock prices of major players like Tesla, Ford, and General Motors have left investors feeling uneasy about the sector as a whole. The primary causes behind this volatility can be attributed to three main factors: competition from emerging EV companies, challenges in the production of new EV models, and geopolitical tensions affecting global supply chains. Rising Competition: The automobile industry is under great pressure to transition from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to greener alternatives. A surge of new market entrants, specializing primarily in electric vehicles, has intensified the competition. From established companies like Tesla to startups such as Rivian, Lucid Motors, and NIO, the market is becoming increasingly saturated with new electric-powered options. Automakers with a strong legacy in traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, like Ford and General Motors, have also started moving toward electrification, further increasing the competition. This competitive landscape has raised concerns among investors about the profitability and future growth of auto stocks. Production Challenges: Manufacturing electric vehicles is no easy task, with frequent challenges plaguing the production process. Issues ranging from global chip shortages to the limited availability of essential battery components hinder the progress of electric vehicle production. These challenges have resulted in production delays and frustrated consumers, which in turn contribute to the uneasiness felt by the investment community. Regulatory Environment: Governments around the world have begun to advocate more vehemently for the adoption of electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change. This has led to a tightening of regulations and emission standards for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, fostering further uncertainty in the industry. The Biden administration's massive infrastructure plan includes significant funding for EV charging infrastructure and tax credits, which could propel the industry forward. However, unforeseen regulatory shifts or delays in implementing such policies could adversely impact the sector. Changing Consumer Preferences: The pace of consumer adoption of electric vehicles is a critical factor affecting investor sentiment towards the automotive industry. While there has been a steady increase in demand for electric vehicles, questions still abound about whether the shift toward sustainable transportation is happening fast enough. Consumers continue to express concerns about the affordability and efficiency of EVs, and any setbacks in consumer adoption could translate into lower revenue and profitability for the auto industry. Conclusion: Wall Street's auto angst is primarily due to the highly uncertain and rapidly evolving landscape of the automotive industry. Factors such as market volatility, mounting competition, production challenges, regulatory shifts, and changing consumer preferences contribute to the lingering sense of trepidation among investors. To regain confidence in this sector, auto companies must continue to adapt to market changes, invest in research and development, and consistently improve the efficiency and affordability of their electric vehicle offerings."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Bill, Frank and Dave were three brothers.

The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

The sure-to-be politically fraught nomination process for Eric Holder's replacement as attorney general will come after next month's midterm elections, the White House said on Tuesday. An official, speaking anonymously about the nomination process, said Senate Democrats urged the White House to wait until after November's contests to put a nominee forward to head the Justice Department. Democrats are urgently working to maintain control of the Senate, and are expected to lose seats in the Republican-controlled House. Holder, the last of President Barack Obama's original cabinet members, was a politically divisive attorney general, and the fight to replace him is expected to be rancorous on Capitol Hill. A nominee could be pushed through a lame duck session after the midterm elections, though other issues on the congressional docket -- like authorizing Obama's use of force in against ISIS -- are expected to dominate proceedings in November and December. \\"I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate,\\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after Holder resigned. \\"That said, I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support.\\" Democrats close to the nominating process have floated several names as potential Holder replacements: the current Labor Secretary Tom Perez, the former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, and former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler are all considered in the mix.

Last updated at 12:16 PM on 5th August 2011. Brainchild: PM's aide Steve Hilton. The death penalty, pulling out of Europe and withdrawing from the European Human Rights Act topped the agenda as the public yesterday got the chance to decide what Parliament debates. The Government launched its ‘e-petition’ website with the promise to consider discussing any subject which attracts 100,000 signatures. Passions ran so high that the site continually crashed as thousands sought to raise issues that politicians usually shy away from. Other popular subjects included calls for the legalisation of cannabis and Formula One to be kept on BBC. But last night the subject attracting the most interest, with 6,000 names, was the death penalty – with calls for and against. Forty of the 200 most subscribed petitions called for the return of capital punishment. Seven of the top 200, including the top one with 3,000 signatures, called for it not to be reinstated. The issue now looks certain to attract enough signatures for it to be debated in Parliament for the first time since 1998, and a vote could follow. Among the most prominent pro-death penalty e-petitions is one calling for child killers and those who murder on-duty police officers to be executed. More than 1,000 people a minute visited the website yesterday. Writing in the Daily Mail yesterday, the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir George Young, warned that MPs cannot ignore the popular groundswell. But critics warned that the e-petitions would allow the Commons to be hijacked by special interest campaigns and mean MPs spending precious Parliamentary time on proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law. Popular petitions included calls for Britain to withdraw from the EU and the European Human Rights Act, an absolute right to self defence in your own home and the decriminalisation of drugs. Others called for prisoners’ diets be restricted to bread and water as in the ‘good old days’. Fail: The highly-anticipated e-petition website crashed within hours of going live. And there were several bizarre petitions including demands that bodybuilding be encouraged to improve the nation’s health, and calls to make it a criminal offence to cruise along in the middle lane of motorways. No 10’s previous e-petition site was suspended ahead of the general election then shelved by the Coalition. But it has been resurrected by David Cameron’s director of strategy, Steve Hilton, with the promise that those that attract more than 100,000 signatures will be considered for debate in Parliament. Several Tory MPs have said they will back calls to reintroduce the death sentence. The last hangings in Britain were in 1964. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public was sick of seeing criminals freed from prison committing further crimes. Sir George Young wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday that the death penalty is likely to be discussed by Parliament. He said: ‘We should recognise that with advances in technology and DNA the chances of getting somebody wrong for a crime like murder is much more remote than it was in the past. ‘If at the very least this debate ends up with us going back to what we were promised at the time the death penalty was repealed – which was that murderers will spend the rest of their days in prison – then the debate will have served the country well.’ Another Tory MP, Andrew Turner, said: ‘It is about time we had a national debate in Parliament. The number of murders was about half in the 1950s. ‘The state makes the decision about drugs, it makes the decision about young men and women being sent to war and it talks about abortion. Why are those so different that this particular issue can’t be talked about?’ But fellow Tory MP Dr Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fight attempts to restore the death penalty. He said: ‘The real clincher for me is that you can always get the wrong people and that is a terrible, terrible tragedy.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘Too many politicians come from safe seats which means they only answer to other politicians. They have refused to discuss a lot of issues that matter to a lot of people.’ Any petition signed by more than 100,000 UK citizens goes to the cross-party Commons backbench business committee, which will decide whether it is worthy of debate. This does not mean any parliamentary bills will be tabled as a result, simply that the matter will be discussed. A spokesman for DirectGov, which runs the e-petitions website, acknowledged that many users had experienced difficulties. ‘We apologise for any inconvenience. This is a result of greater-than-expected demand,’ he said. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Question 1: Why during the ice age or in different ages size of animals was huge but during the evolution size reduced? Question 2: Why in your opinion were certain cities able to profit during the industrial era, but not during the digital age? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Before answering the questions, I will analyze each of them separately, determining the key aspects to address. For Question 1: - Investigate the reasons for large-sized animals during ice ages or different time periods. - Discuss the reduction in size over the course of evolution. For Question 2: - Explore the factors that allowed certain cities to profit during the industrial era. - Discuss why these factors might not have translated into success during the digital age. Now, I will attempt to answer each question, considering their key aspects. Question 1: The size of animals during the ice age or other periods in history was likely due to several factors, including available nutrients, environmental conditions, and evolutionary adaptations. Larger size may have provided advantages in terms of heat retention in cold environments, predation and competition for resources, or other selection pressures. Over time, however, as environments and ecosystems changed, animals evolved to optimize their size and adapt to the new conditions. Smaller size can offer benefits like reduced energy requirements, increased agility, or faster reproduction rates. This shift in size could have been influenced by factors like climate change, competition, and reduction in available resources necessary for maintaining large body size. Question 2: During the industrial era, cities that profited were often those with advantageous access to resources, such as proximity to raw materials like coal and iron, or efficient transport networks like rivers and ports. Additionally, these cities could attract a large labor force and capital through favorable government policies or industrial concentrations. However, in the digital age, success has shifted to depend more on innovation, technological infrastructure, and highly educated talent. Cities that have struggled to adapt may not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to support the digital economy, or they may be unable to effectively attract the skilled workforce required for knowledge-based industries. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. While both questions involve change over time, Question 1 focuses on the evolution of animal size, while Question 2 deals with the economic success of cities in two different eras. The underlying themes and subjects of the two questions are distinct."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

A passerby advised him to throw an umbrella he was carrying at the monkeys to scare them away. Swami threw the umbrella, and the monkeys stopped chasing him. This experience taught him the importance of facing challenges head-on, rather than avoiding them. Story 3: The Cobras in a Snake Charmer's Basket During his travels, Swami Vivekananda watched as a snake charmer manipulated an unsuspecting crowd by replacing the cobras in his basket with harmless snakes, while preaching about compassion and non-violence. Swami exposed the snake charmer's trickery and taught the crowd that truth alone triumphs. Now, I will address the second question: \\"Did Swami Vivekananda write any book?\\" Step 1: Research books authored by Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda did not write any books in the traditional sense, as most of his teachings and discourses were compiled by his disciples and followers into various volumes. Some of these compilations include: 1. Raja Yoga 2. Karma Yoga 3. Jnana Yoga 4. Bhakti Yoga 5. Inspired Talks Finally, I will address the third question: \\"Are these two questions asking the same thing?\\" No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question seeks information about famous stories involving Swami Vivekananda, while the second question asks whether he wrote any books. The first question is about anecdotes and life events, and the second question is about his literary contributions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: John joined the army, apparently motivated by a desire to see the world. However, the fighting started - this indicates a situation of conflict or war. Given this context, let's analyze the answer options: A. Fort: While forts are sometimes associated with military activities, they are not directly related to the process of fighting or war. B. Orphans: While war can unfortunately create orphans, this is not something a soldier actively \\"sees\\" when involved in a conflict. C. Battlefield: This makes sense given the context - the battlefield is directly related to what a soldier \\"sees\\" when the fighting starts. D. Other countries: Even though John wanted to see the world, the statement doesn't hint that he got to see other countries when the fighting started. E. War: While it's true that John would experience war, the term is too broad and doesn't speak to what he would \\"see\\". After this analysis, the best answer is Option C - battlefield.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the information you found does not provide the correct answer to your question about how Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, died. Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948. He was shot and killed by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist who opposed Gandhi's vision of a secular, united India that included both Hindus and Muslims. The assassination took place in New Delhi, just a few months after India had gained its independence from British rule in August 1947. On the evening of January 30, 1948, Gandhi was walking to a prayer meeting at the Birla House, a location where he held his nightly multi-faith prayer services. As he was walking with his grandnieces among a small crowd of people, Nathuram Godse approached him and bowed in a sign of respect. When Gandhi returned the gesture, Godse pulled out a Beretta semi-automatic pistol and fired three shots into Gandhi's chest at point-blank range. Gandhi's assassination led to his immediate martyrdom, and his legacy as a symbol of peace and non-violent resistance to oppression has lived on ever since. His approaches to civil disobedience and non-violent protest inspired leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, who adopted Gandhi's methods as part of their own struggles for freedom and equality. Although the information you found states that Mahatma Gandhi was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India, it does not directly answer your question about how he died. To conclude, Mahatma Gandhi died as a result of an assassination carried out by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Shionogi & Co has applied to health regulators in the United States, Canada, and Europe for approval of its HIV drug Dolutegravir, we cannot be certain that the drug will be approved. The approval process for a new drug involves rigorous testing, evaluation of the drug's safety, and assessment of its effectiveness in treating the targeted disease or condition. This process can take a substantial amount of time and effort from both the pharmaceutical company and the regulatory agencies. It is important to note that just because a company applies for regulatory approval does not guarantee that the drug will be approved. Regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have strict requirements and procedures in place to ensure that only safe and effective drugs reach the market. In this specific case, Shionogi & Co has developed Dolutegravir in partnership with Viiv Healthcare, an AIDS drug joint venture between pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer.

As we were talking, she said, \\"I just wish I had meaningful work. I don't feel like I am making a difference. I am just wasting my life.\\" This is the theme I hear most often from clients who have been in the workforce awhile.All of us want to feel like we are making a difference. We want to believe our work means something. The problem comes in defining \\"meaningful work\\". What is it? That answer is different for everyone. For some meaningful work might be helping others organize their office. For others it may mean making a million dollars. What really matters is how you see it. What is meaningful work to you? Take out a piece of paper and answer these questions. How do you define meaningful work? When do you feel like you are really making a difference? What work have you done so far that feels the most meaningful? Write down whatever comes to mind. What you want to do is meaningful. It is very easy to start judging yourself as being selfish. Stop! Allow yourself to be honest. The fact is when Picasso painted; he was doing it because he liked to paint. He was not thinking, \\"Oh, I hope this brings joy to others' lives.\\" He painted because he wanted to. When Beethoven composed, he did it because he loved music. Even scientists searching for a cure for cancer are immersed in their work because it fascinates them. Don't look down on your work. It is easy to _ the importance of work that feels meaningful. I remember Tony Robbins told a story of talking with the owner of a major company. The man said to Tony, \\"I wish I could do what you do because it makes such adifference in people's lives\\". Tony said, \\"You have got to be kidding! Look at what adifference you make. You provide work, health insurance and security for thousands ofpeople!\\" Don't underestimate the value you provide.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was restored by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989?, using the article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009.

Definition: In this task you will be given a list of dictionaries. A dictionary is a set of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and has a value associated with that key. You should sort the list of dictionaries from smallest to largest by their 'first' key. If there is two dictionaries with the same 'first' value then sort them by their 'second' key. Negative numbers should come before positive numbers. Input: [{'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}] Output:","completion":"The task you're describing involves sorting. This can be achieved in Python, for example, using its built-in sorting function. The simplest way to sort a list of dictionaries in Python is using the built-in \`sorted()\` function with a custom sorting key. You want to sort your data first by the 'first' key and then by the 'second' key if the 'first' fields are equal. For your specific example, here’s how you can do the sorting: \`\`\`python data = [{'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}] sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: (x['first'], x['second'])) \`\`\` This Python code will output: \`\`\`python [{'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}, {'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}] \`\`\` In this sorted result, dictionaries are ordered from those with smallest to largest 'first' key. When there are two dictionaries with the same 'first' value, they have been sorted by their 'second' key as specified. As evident, the dictionary with negative 'first' value comes before those with positive values. However, the output above does not explicitly sort negative numbers before positive ones if the 'first' fields are equal, only coincidentally in this case due to the nature of number line. To ensure negative numbers comes before positive numbers, we can separate sorting into two steps: \`\`\`python # First sort by 'second', then by 'first' sorted_data = sorted(data, key = lambda x: x['second']) sorted_data = sorted(sorted_data, key = lambda x: x['first']) \`\`\` This will keep relative order in terms of 'second' keys when 'first' keys are equal, so negative numbers will precede positive ones. Remember, sorting in Python is stable, i.e., it maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon many music fans were wondering how fantastic it is! If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4. If not, you do need to know something before buying one, even if you are familiar with MP3. MP3 is the CD-like disc with greater capacity. How about MP4? This small digital product will really enrich the joy from listening to music. You can even feel the \\"touch\\" of music to your soul! Now, some similar digital products advertised as \\"MP4 players\\" are simply MP3 players, which do not play video and MPEG format and also lack other particular functions. These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \\"MP4\\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?! It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet. With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality. By installing DVD-MP4 software, you can transfer particular music from a DVD to an MP4 video file. It really excites your listening music experience.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... When did President Trump announce his plans to suspend military exercises? - Before he met with Kim Jong Un in August - After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th - not enough information - After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment Answer:","completion":"President Trump announced his plans to suspend military exercises after he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th during their summit in Singapore."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem: a company that ships boxes to a total of 12 distribution centers uses color coding to identify each center . if either a single color or a pair of two different colors is chosen to represent each center and if each center is uniquely represented by that choice of one or two colors , what is the minimum number of colors needed for the coding ? ( assume that the order of the colors in a pair does not matter ) Options: a ) 4 , b ) 5 , c ) 6 , d ) 12 , e ) 24","completion":"To solve this problem, we first need to find a mathematical expression that represents the total number of color combinations available with a given number of colors. Since the color pairs do not depend on the order, we can use the combination formula (nCr) where n is the total number of colors and r is the number of colors taken at a time (in this case, 2). The expression is as follows: Total combinations = nC1 + nC2, where nC1 represents the single colors and nC2 represents the color pairs. We are given that there are 12 distribution centers, so our expression should be equal to or greater than 12 to represent each center uniquely: nC1 + nC2 >= 12 Substituting the combination formula, we get: (n! / (1!(n-1)!)) + (n! / (2!(n-2)!)) >= 12 Now, we need to find the minimum number of colors (n) that will satisfy this inequality. We can start with the options provided and test them one by one. Option (a): n = 4: (4! / (1!(4-1)!)) + (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) = 4 + 6 = 10 Since 10 is not equal to or greater than 12, this option is not suitable. Option (b): n = 5: (5! / (1!(5-1)!)) + (5! / (2!(5-2)!)) = 5 + 10 = 15 15 is greater than 12, which means that with 5 colors, we can uniquely represent each of the 12 distribution centers.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was last seen at an archaeological dig? ? Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone. Jeff and Eric rig a backboard and bring Mathias out of the shaft. Answer:","completion":"Heinrich"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the house from which a chancel, separated from the nave by an oak screen, projects eastward from the main plan? The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp. Five oak-framed bins inside may have held barley for the Brew-house, which is now used as a toilet block. The answer is:","completion":"Little Moreton Hall"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: Which union was in dispute with British Airways and called strike action in March 2010","completion":"The union that was in dispute with British Airways and called strike action in March 2010 was Unite the Union, specifically the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (BASSA), which is a section of the Unite union representing cabin crew members. Unite is a British and Irish trade union established in 2007 as a result of a merger between two major unions, Amicus and the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU). Today, it is one of the largest labor unions in the United Kingdom, representing a wide array of workers in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, manufacturing, and, of course, aviation. The union seeks to protect the rights and interests of its members by engaging in collective bargaining, offering legal support, and representing their concerns in negotiations with employers. The dispute between Unite and British Airways began in 2009 when the airline announced its plans to cut costs in response to the global financial crisis. To achieve this, British Airways proposed several changes, including reducing the number of cabin crew members on long-haul flights, freezing pay for two years, and implementing new contractual terms for new employees. These changes were met with great resistance from the union, as they believed the measures would compromise the job security, pay, and working conditions of their members. Unite the Union and British Airways attempted to resolve the conflict through negotiations but were unable to reach an agreement, which ultimately led to a series of strikes. In March 2010, cabin crew members represented by Unite the Union voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action, with 80.7% of those who returned their ballot papers voting in support. The strike action proceeded in two phases: firstly, a three-day walkout that began on March 20th, followed by a four-day strike commencing on March 27th. The strikes caused significant disruption to the airline's services, with hundreds of flights being canceled, leading to travel chaos for thousands of passengers and financial losses for the airline. British Airways, on the other hand, accused Unite of holding the company and its customers 'to ransom' and urged the union to reconsider its tactics. Despite the impact of the strikes, the dispute remained unresolved for an extended period, with further strikes and legal battles continuing well into 2010 and 2011. Eventually, in May 2011, both parties came to a provisional agreement in which British Airways agreed to reinstate staff travel perks that had been withdrawn due to the strike action, and Unite agreed to end the industrial action. The deal also included terms on job security, pay scales, and working conditions. This marked the end of a long and costly conflict, showcasing the complexities that can arise when labor unions and employers disagree on the appropriate course of action during times of economic hardship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: China has released a second giant panda bred in captivity into the wild after giving it special survival training, state-run media say.","completion":"Title: China's Successful Release of a Second Captive-Bred Giant Panda into the Wild Introduction China has achieved another milestone in its efforts to conserve and protect the endangered giant panda species. The country has successfully released a second giant panda bred in captivity into the wild, having provided it with specialized survival training. The initiative, as reported by state-run media, demonstrates the nation's commitment to wildlife conservation and its focus on enhancing the population of this cherished and iconic species. Specialized Survival Training Before the release, the captive-bred giant panda underwent an intensive and unique training program designed to equip it with essential survival skills. This training included teaching the panda to forage for food, identify and avoid predators, and protect itself from potential threats in the wild. The survival training also involved acclimatizing the panda to the environment it would face after its release. This was achieved by gradually introducing it to the natural conditions, flora, and fauna of its new habitat and providing a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem it would become a part of. Achievements and Implications The successful release of the second captive-bred giant panda into the wild serves as a major accomplishment for China's wildlife conservation efforts. It highlights the effectiveness of the specialized survival training program in preparing captive-bred animals for life in the wild. Moreover, it exemplifies the potential of such programs to contribute to the long-term conservation of endangered species. This achievement also has global implications, as it showcases a viable method to rehabilitate and reintroduce captive-bred animals into their natural habitats. By sharing their knowledge, expertise, and best practices, China's wildlife conservationists can inspire and guide other countries working towards the preservation and recovery of endangered species. The Future of Giant Panda Conservation The successful release of the second captive-bred giant panda serves as a testament to China's dedication to protecting and conserving this beloved species. The nation aims to continue on this trajectory, investing in research, monitoring the progress of released pandas, and refining their survival training programs. However, conservation efforts do not stop at reintroduction. The long-term protection of the giant panda also depends on the conservation and restoration of their habitats, as well as ongoing research and collaboration with international partners.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang. Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom. The guests arrived. I introduced my two daughters to each of them. The adults were nice and kind and said how lucky we were to have such good kids. Each of the guests made a particular fuss over Kelly, the younger one, admiring her dress, her hair and her smile. They said she was a remarkable girl to be carrying coats upstairs at her age. I thought to myself that we adults usually _ the younger one because she's the one who seems more easily hurt. We do it with the best of intentions. But we seldom think of how it might affect the other child. I was a little worried that Kristen would feel she was being outshined. I was about to serve dinner when I realized that she had been missing for twenty minutes. I ran upstairs and found her in the bedroom, crying.

South Sister, also known as \\"Charity\\", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at 10,363 feet (3,159 m). The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria.

It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The two people who formed the supergroup A Perfect Circle are Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life.

The reviewer describes the film as a \\"humanist\\" and \\"gently political\\" meditation, which indicates that the movie showcases a profound understanding of human values and touches upon political themes in a subtle and thoughtful manner.

Article: In 1975 the US DOT conservatively identified a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities.

Military Rank: Khatami held a high rank in the Iranian military, specifically as the Commander of the Iranian Air Force. This position suggests he had considerable experience and skills in military aviation and leadership. b. Recognitions and Awards: Khatami held the title CVO, which stands for Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, a British knighthood order conferred upon individuals who have served the British monarchy in a personal capacity. This implies that Khatami had strong connections and made significant contributions to the British Crown, possibly through diplomatic or military cooperation between Iran and the United Kingdom. 3. Connections to the Iranian Royal Family: a. Advisory Role: Mohammad Amir Khatami was an advisor to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last king of Iran who ruled from 1941 until 1979.

Answer this question: who captained the indian cricket team to its first odi world cup victory in 1983??","completion":"The Indian cricket team was captained by Kapil Dev to its first ODI (One Day International) World Cup victory in 1983. Born as Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj on January 6, 1959, in Chandigarh, India, he was an all-rounder who became one of the most prominent and influential cricketers in Indian cricket history. Kapil Dev's career spanned a period from 1978-1994, during which he represented India in 131 Test matches and 225 ODIs. Being an excellent batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, he played an instrumental role in bringing success to the Indian cricket team in the 1983 World Cup. The 1983 World Cup, officially known as the Prudential Cup '83, was the third edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup and took place in England from June 9 to June 25, 1983. It consisted of a total of 27 matches, and eight teams participated in the tournament. These teams were England, India, West Indies, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe. Kapil Dev, as the captain of the Indian team, led from the front to inspire his team in the tournament. He scored 303 runs and took 12 wickets, contributing both with the bat and the ball. His unbeaten 175 against Zimbabwe in a group-stage match at Tunbridge Wells ranks as one of the most memorable innings in the history of the World Cup. This innings is significant as it came at a time when India was struggling at 17/5, and it eventually led to a victory, which was crucial in ensuring India's place in the semi-finals. The Indian team reached the finals of the 1983 World Cup where they faced the strong West Indies side, led by Clive Lloyd. The West Indies team was a powerhouse in world cricket at the time, having won both earlier editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979. Few expected India to pull off an upset in the finals, but Kapil Dev's leadership steered the team to victory. India batted first in the final and managed to score only 183 runs. West Indies, in response, was cruising towards victory at 50/1. However, the Indian bowlers, led by Mohinder Amarnath and Madan Lal, struck back and bundled out the mighty West Indies side for 140 runs. Mohinder Amarnath was declared the 'Man of the Match' for his match-winning all-round performance of 26 runs with the bat and 3 wickets for 12 runs with the ball in the final. The 1983 World Cup victory by the Indian cricket team, captained by Kapil Dev, remains a momentous event in Indian sports history.

Q: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

Have you ever wondered why Americans spell those words without a \\"u\\"? Is it because they are lazy? Of course not. In fact,the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster (1758-1843). He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions . He dropped the British \\"u\\" in some words. And he changed \\"centre\\" into \\"center\\" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded. Webster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions. In defining preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \\"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\\" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom. \\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\\"said Joshua Kendall,who is working on a biography about Webster. \\"He at last bonded us through our language.\\" Question: Why did Noah Webster create these differences in his dictionary?

Next question: when do niles and daphne finally get together?","completion":"The characters of Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce) and Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) from the popular American sitcom \\"Frasier\\" have one of the most beloved love stories in television history. Throughout its 11 seasons (1993-2004), viewers witnessed Niles' unrequited love for Daphne, his brother's live-in housekeeper and therapist, and awaited eagerly for the beloved characters to finally get together. Niles was love-struck by Daphne the first moment he saw her in the pilot episode, but his admiration from afar continued for seven seasons while he was trapped in an unhappy marriage with Maris Crane (who is often referred to but never appears on screen). The relationship between Niles and Daphne finally begins to evolve in the seventh season. The precise turning point comes during the three-part finale of Season 7, \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue\\". In \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue – Part 1,\\" Niles helps Daphne try on her wedding dress for her upcoming marriage to Donny Douglas (Saul Rubinek). Overcome by emotion, Niles confesses his feelings to Daphne, leading them to share a passionate kiss. Despite this revelation, Daphne goes ahead with her wedding plans to Donny in \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue – Part 2,\\" and Niles tries to suppress his feelings and support her decision. However, just before she is about to get married, Daphne confesses to Niles that she might have feelings for him, too. Inspired by her admission, Niles cancels his own wedding to Mel (Jane Adams), a woman he had begun dating after his divorce from Maris, to be with Daphne. The subsequent eighth season is then dedicated to the evolving relationship between Niles and Daphne as they navigate the repercussions of their actions – both dealing with failed engagements to their respective partners. Thus, Niles and Daphne officially become a couple during the end of Season 7 and the beginning of Season 8, culminating towards their eventual marriage in Season 10's \\"The Ring Cycle\\".

With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - Christ in the House of His Parents (184950) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting the Holy Family in Saint Joseph's carpentry workshop. The painting was extremely controversial when first exhibited, prompting many negative reviews, most notably one written by Charles Dickens. It catapulted the previously obscure Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to notoriety and was a major contributor to the debate about Realism in the arts. - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - Thomas Carlyle (4 December 1795 5 February 1881) was a Scottish philosopher, satirical writer, essayist, historian and teacher. Considered one of the most important social commentators of his time, he presented many lectures during his lifetime with certain acclaim in the Victorian era. One of those conferences resulted in his famous work \\"On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History\\" where he explains that the key role in history lies in the actions of the \\"Great Man\\", claiming that \\"History is nothing but the biography of the Great Man\\". - John Ruskin (8 February 1819 20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, as well as an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin also penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for evolution?\\" is \\"that material's properties\\", given that random changes in genes are essential for evolution? The answer is:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for evolution?\\" is not \\"that material's properties.\\" Instead, several key factors are essential for the process of evolution to occur. Random changes in genes, known as mutations, are indeed critical for evolution, but they are just one aspect of this multifaceted process. The following components are necessary for evolution: 1. Genetic variation: Genetic variation within a population occurs due to the presence of different genes and alleles, which can result from mutations or genetic recombination during sexual reproduction. Diversity is essential for evolution as it provides the raw material on which evolutionary forces, such as natural selection, can act. 2. Inheritance: For evolution to occur, traits and genes responsible for these traits must be passed down from generation to generation. This inheritance ensures that some of the genetic variations will persist over time. 3. Mutations: As you've mentioned, random changes in genes, or mutations, are essential for evolution. They introduce new genetic variation into a population, supporting the adaptation and evolution of species. 4. Natural selection: Natural selection is a crucial force driving evolution. It is the process by which organisms with inherited traits that provide a survival or reproductive advantage in their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes to the next generation. As time passes, those advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population. 5. Genetic drift: Genetic drift, a random change in gene frequencies over time, also plays a vital role in evolution. In small populations, genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic variation, potentially affecting a population's ability to adapt to environmental changes. 6. Gene flow: Gene flow, or the exchange of genetic material between different populations of a species, is essential for evolution. It can promote genetic variation, allowing populations to evolve by introducing new traits and increasing the likelihood of adaptation to changing environments. In summary, while random changes in genes are a critical component of evolution, various essential factors, including genetic variation, inheritance, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, are necessary for the evolutionary process to take place."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Under Canadian law, parole would usually be virtually automatic, but Karla's case is no ordinary case. Karla has been sent to Saskatoon to meet with a prison appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Arnold, to evaluate her suitability for parole. Most of the movie is told from the vantage point of Karla and Dr. Arnold examining the past actions that landed her in prison with a view to making a decision on parole.Karla begins by discussing how she and her ex-husband Paul Bernardo first met. At age 18, Karla is working in a veterinary clinic and is sent to Toronto by her employer to attend a veterinary convention. However, she is also interested in meeting men. Karla and a female colleague are in a hotel restaurant when they are approached by Paul and a male friend. There is an almost immediate strong attraction between Paul and Karla, and they soon find themselves making love in Karla's hotel room. Karla's colleague and Paul's friend are also in the room and feel quite uncomfortable.Karla and Paul begin a relationship which, at first, seems quite happy and successful. Karla gives Paul a pair of handcuffs for use in sex play. However, while having sex, Paul introduces the possibility that he might be a rapist. In looking back at this incident with Dr. Arnold, Karla claims she thought this was just innocent sex talk on Paul's part.Paul's true meaning, however, is quickly shown to the viewer to be something far more sinister: Paul is, in fact, the notorious Scarborough rapist, who has been terrorizing women with frequent and brutal assaults.

Question: What were the full names of the two people whose libraries they left formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium? Answer the above question based on the context below: A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","completion":"The two individuals whose libraries became the foundation of the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library were Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Edward IV, King of England. Philip the Good's full name was Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, also known as Philip the Good or Philippe le Bon, whose reign lasted from 1419 to 1467. He was an important patron of the arts and a significant collector of illuminated books. His vast collection of over a thousand illuminated manuscripts served as a symbol of his wealth, power, and Christian piety. Philip's patronage played a leading role in the growth and dominance of the manuscript industry in the Lowlands, making it a formidable force in Europe for several generations. Edward IV's full name was Edward Plantagenet, King of England, who reigned from 1461 until his death in April 1483, with a brief interruption in 1470-1471. Like Philip the Good, Edward IV was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts and was deeply influenced by the Burgundian book-collecting tradition. His marriage to Elizabeth Woodville may have helped strengthen his connection to the traditions of the Lowlands. The collections left behind by these two influential figures, Philip the Good and Edward IV, eventually combined to form the nucleus of both the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library. Their patronage not only impacted the growth of the manuscript industry within their respective regions but also significantly contributed to the export market for Netherlandish illuminators, who designed and created numerous works specifically to cater to the tastes and preferences of foreign elites. As the domestic patronage experienced a decline after the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, the export market gained even more importance, leading to the creation of more lavish and opulently decorated illuminated manuscripts that were tailored to the tastes of foreign nobility, including rulers like Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland, and Eleanor of Viseu."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Music for Nations is a British independent record label focusing mainly on rock and metal. It was a subsidiary of the larger label distributor Zomba Records, which in turn is now owned by BMG. - \`\` Underdose '' is the first single by Essex alternative metal band InMe .

It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Overgrown Eden is the debut album from Essex alternative metal band InMe. The album was released in the UK on 30 January 2003. The album produced four singles before and after the album's release. The singles released were \\"Underdose\\", \\"Firefly\\", \\"Crushed like Fruit\\" and \\"Neptune\\". The album was re-released in its original format on 5 June 2006. This was due to getting the rights for \\"Overgrown Eden\\" from the now defunct record label Music for Nations. Due to the demise of MFN, this was the first and last album released by InMe on this record label. - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles.

Compulsory education is essential in many countries, as it ensures that children receive the necessary knowledge, skills, and experiences for their future. When parents or guardians fail to ensure that their children attend school, they may be seen as committing a crime or neglecting their responsibilities. Some possible reasons why the children might not have attended school could include illness, lack of adequate schools or teachers in the area, or personal reasons related to the family. However, in many cases, parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their children attend school or face consequences as a result of not complying with educational laws and regulations.

Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3).

Movie title: Flying Dagger Movie plot: The Hon [Dagger] Brothers, Chung and Lam, who are in fact uncle and cousin, are rival bounty hunters to the Fung [Bewitchment] Sisters, and take glee in thwarting each other because Chung refused to marry Lady Fung. Fung Ling and Lam are also in love, but do not acknowledge it. Emperor Tsao hires the Hons to capture the Nine-Tails Fox, whom he claims has made a major robbery of his household, including the rape and murder of his daughter and the murder of 41 servants. The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase them (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) chase the Hons to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the apsara known as Flying Cat to walk out on him. The group discovers that Never Die is allergic to glib talk, and begin speaking to each other glibly, Chung, too embarrassed to speak to Lady Fung in that way, speaking to Nine-Tails Fox, and the two pulling off each other shirts, and trap him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The announcement early yesterday morning of experimental evidence for what’s presumably the Higgs particle brings a certain closure to a story I’ve watched (and sometimes been a part of) for nearly 40 years. In some ways I felt like a teenager again. Hearing about a new particle being discovered. And asking the same questions I would have asked at age 15. “What’s its mass?” “What decay channel?” “What total width?” “How many sigma?” “How many events?” When I was a teenager in the 1970s, particle physics was my great interest. It felt like I had a personal connection to all those kinds of particles that were listed in the little book of particle properties I used to carry around with me. The pions and kaons and lambda particles and f mesons and so on. At some level, though, the whole picture was a mess. A hundred kinds of particles, with all sorts of detailed properties and relations. But there were theories. The quark model. Regge theory. Gauge theories. S-matrix theory. It wasn’t clear what theory was correct. Some theories seemed shallow and utilitarian; others seemed deep and philosophical. Some were clean but boring. Some seemed contrived. Some were mathematically sophisticated and elegant; others were not. By the mid-1970s, though, those in the know had pretty much settled on what became the Standard Model. In a sense it was the most vanilla of the choices. It seemed a little contrived, but not very. It involved some somewhat sophisticated mathematics, but not the most elegant or deep mathematics. But it did have at least one notable feature: of all the candidate theories, it was the one that most extensively allowed explicit calculations to be made. They weren’t easy calculations—and in fact it was doing those calculations that got me started having computers to do calculations, and set me on the path that eventually led to Mathematica. But at the time I think the very difficulty of the calculations seemed to me and everyone else to make the theory more satisfying to work with, and more likely to be meaningful. At the least in the early years there were still surprises, though. In November 1974 there was the announcement of the J/psi particle. And one asked the same questions as today, starting with “What’s the mass?” (That particle’s was 3.1 GeV; today’s is 126 GeV.) But unlike with the Higgs particle, to almost everyone the J/psi was completely unexpected. At first it wasn’t at all clear what it could be. Was it evidence of something truly fundamental and exciting? Or was it in a sense just a repeat of things that had been seen before? My own very first published paper (feverishly worked on over Christmas 1974 soon after I turned 15) speculated that it and some related phenomena might be something exciting: a sign of substructure in the electron. But however nice and interesting a theory may be, nature doesn’t have to follow it. And in this case it didn’t. And instead the phenomena that had been seen turned out to have a more mundane explanation: they were signs of an additional (4th) kind of quark (the c or charm quark). In the next few years, more surprises followed. Mounting evidence showed that there was a heavier analog of the electron and muon—the tau lepton. Then in July 1977 there was another “sudden discovery”, made at Fermilab: this time of a particle based on the b quark. I happened to be spending the summer of 1977 doing particle physics at Argonne National Lab, not far away from Fermilab. And it was funny: I remember there was a kind of blasé attitude toward the discovery. Like “another unexpected particle physics discovery; there’ll be lots more”. But as it turned out that’s not what happened. It’s been 35 years, and when it comes to new particles and the like, there really hasn’t been a single surprise. (The discovery of neutrino masses is a partial counterexample, as are various discoveries in cosmology.) Experiments have certainly discovered things—the W and Z bosons, the validity of QCD, the top quark. But all of them were as expected from the Standard Model; there were no surprises. Needless to say, verifying the predictions of the Standard Model hasn’t always been easy. A few times I happened to be at the front lines. In 1977, for example, I computed what the Standard Model predicted for the rate of producing charm particles in proton-proton collisions. But the key experiment at the time said the actual rate was much lower. I spent ages trying to figure out what might be wrong—either with my calculations or the underlying theory. But in the end—in a rather formative moment for my understanding of applying the scientific method—it turned out that what was wrong was actually the experiment, not the theory. In 1979—when I was at the front lines of the “discovery of the gluon”—almost the opposite thing happened. The conviction in the Standard Model was by then so great that the experiments agreed too early, even before the calculations were correctly finished. Though once again, in the end all was well, and the method I invented for doing analysis of the experiments is in fact still routinely used today. By 1981 I myself was beginning to drift away from particle physics, not least because I’d started to work on things that I thought were somehow more fundamental. But I still used to follow what was happening in particle physics. And every so often I’d get excited when I heard about some discovery rumored or announced that seemed somehow unexpected or inexplicable from the Standard Model. But in the end it was all rather disappointing. There’d be questions about each discovery—and in later years there’d often be suspicious correlations with deadlines for funding decisions. And every time, after a while, the discovery would melt away. Leaving only the plain Standard Model, with no surprises. Through all of this, though, there was always one loose end dangling: the Higgs particle. It wasn’t clear just what it would take to see it, but if the Standard Model was correct, it had to exist. To me, the Higgs particle and the associated Higgs mechanism had always seemed like an unfortunate hack. In setting up the Standard Model, one begins with a mathematically quite pristine theory in which every particle is perfectly massless. But in reality almost all particles (apart from the photon) have nonzero masses. And the point of the Higgs mechanism is to explain this—without destroying desirable features of the original mathematical theory. Here’s how it basically works. Every type of particle in the Standard Model is associated with waves propagating in a field—just as photons are associated with waves propagating in the electromagnetic field. But for almost all types of particles, the average amplitude value of the underlying field is zero. But for the Higgs field, one imagines something different. One imagines instead that there’s a nonlinear instability that’s built into the mathematical equations that govern it, that leads to a nonzero average value for the field throughout the universe. And it’s then assumed that all types of particles continually interact with this background field—in such a way as to act so that they have a mass. But what mass? Well, that’s determined by how strongly a particle interacts with the background field. And that in turn is determined by a parameter that one inserts into the model. So to get the observed masses of the particles, one’s just inserting one parameter for each particle, and then arranging it to give the mass of the particle. That might seem contrived. But at some level it’s OK. It would have been nice if the theory had predicted the masses of the particles. But given that it does not, inserting their values as interaction strengths seems as reasonable as anything. Still, there’s another problem. To get the observed particle masses, the background Higgs field that exists throughout the universe has to have an incredibly high density of energy and mass. Which one might expect would have a huge gravitational effect—in fact, enough of an effect to cause the universe to roll up into a tiny ball. Well, to avoid this, one has to assume that there’s a parameter (a “cosmological constant”) built right into the fundamental equations of gravity that cancels to incredibly high precision the effects of the energy and mass density associated with the background Higgs field. And if this doesn’t seem implausible enough, back around 1980 I was involved in noticing something else: this delicate cancellation can’t survive at the high temperatures of the very early Big Bang universe. And the result is that there has to be a glitch in the expansion of the universe. My calculations said this glitch would not be terribly big—but stretching the theory somewhat led to the possibility of a huge glitch, and in fact an early version of the whole inflationary universe scenario. Back around 1980, it seemed as if unless there was something wrong with the Standard Model it wouldn’t be long before the Higgs particle would show up. The guess was that its mass might be perhaps 10 GeV (about 10 proton masses)—which would allow it to be detected in the current or next generation of particle accelerators. But it didn’t show up. And every time a new particle accelerator was built, there’d be talk about how it would finally find the Higgs. But it never did. Back in 1979 I’d actually worked on questions about what possible masses particles could have in the Standard Model. The instability in the Higgs field used to generate mass ran the risk of making the whole universe unstable. And I found that this would happen if there were quarks with masses above about 300 GeV. This made me really curious about the top quark—which pretty much had to exist, but kept on not being discovered. Until finally in 1995 it showed up—with a mass of 173 GeV, leaving to my mind a surprisingly thin margin away from total instability of the universe. There were a few bounds on the mass of the Higgs particle too. At first they were very loose (“below 1000 GeV” etc.). But gradually they became tighter and tighter. And after huge amounts of experimental and theoretical work, by last year they pretty much said the mass had to be between 110 and 130 GeV. So in a sense one can’t be too surprised about the announcement today of evidence for a Higgs particle with a mass of 126 GeV. But explicitly seeing what appears to be the Higgs particle is an important moment. Which finally seems to tie up a 40-year loose end. At some level I’m actually a little disappointed. I’ve made no secret—even to Peter Higgs—that I’ve never especially liked the Higgs mechanism. It’s always seemed like a hack. And I’ve always hoped that in the end there’d be something more elegant and deep responsible for something as fundamental as the masses of particles. But it appears that nature is just picking what seems like a pedestrian solution to the problem: the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model. Was it worth spending more than 10 billion to find this out? I definitely think so. Now, what’s actually come out is perhaps not the most exciting thing that could have come out. But there’s absolutely no way one could have been sure of this outcome in advance. Perhaps I’m too used to the modern technology industry where billions of dollars get spent on corporate activities and transactions all the time. But to me spending only 10 billion to get this far in investigating the basic theory of physics seems like quite a bargain. I think it could be justified almost just for the self-esteem of our species: that despite all our specific issues, we’re continuing a path we’ve been on for hundreds of years, systematically making progress in understanding how our universe works. And somehow there’s something ennobling about seeing what’s effectively a worldwide collaboration of people working together in this direction. Indeed, staying up late to watch the announcement early yesterday morning reminded me more than a bit of being a kid in England nearly 43 years ago and staying up late to watch the Apollo 11 landing and moonwalk (which was timed to be at prime time in the US but not Europe). But I have to say that for a world achievement yesterday’s “it’s a 5 sigma effect” was distinctly less dramatic than “the Eagle has landed”. To be fair, a particle physics experiment has a rather different rhythm than a space mission. But I couldn’t help feeling a certain sadness for the lack of pizazz in yesterday’s announcement. Of course, it’s been a long hard road for particle physics these past 30 or so years. Back in the 1950s when particle physics was launched in earnest, there was a certain sense of follow-on and “thank you” for the Manhattan project. And in the 1960s and 1970s the pace of discoveries kept the best and the brightest coming into particle physics. But by the 1980s as particle physics settled into its role as an established academic discipline, there began to be an ever stronger “brain drain”. And by the time the Superconducting Super Collider project was canceled in 1993, it was clear that particle physics had lost its special place in the world of basic research. Personally, I found it sad to watch. Visiting particle physics labs after absences of 20 years, and seeing crumbling infrastructure in what I had remembered as such vibrant places. In a sense it is remarkable and admirable that through all this thousands of particle physicists persisted, and have now brought us (presumably) the Higgs particle. But watching yesterday’s announcement, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a certain sense of resigned exhaustion. I suppose I had hoped for something qualitatively different from those particle physics talks I used to hear 40 years ago. Yes, the particle energies were larger, the detector was bigger, and the data rates were faster. But otherwise it seemed like nothing had changed (well, there also seemed to be a new predilection for statistical ideas like p values). There wasn’t even striking and memorable dynamic imagery of prized particle events, making use of all those modern visualization techniques that people like me have worked so hard to develop. If the Standard Model is correct, yesterday’s announcement is likely to be the last major discovery that could be made in a particle accelerator in our generation. Now, of course, there could be surprises, but it’s not clear how much one should bet on them. So is it still worth building particle accelerators? Whatever happens, there is clearly great value in maintaining the thread of knowledge that exists today about how to do it. But reaching particle energies where without surprises one can reasonably expect to see new phenomena will be immensely challenging. I have thought for years that investing in radically new ideas for particle acceleration (e.g. higher energies for fewer particles) might be the best bet—though it clearly carries risk. Could future discoveries in particle physics immediately give us new inventions or technology? Years ago things like “quark bombs” seemed conceivable. But probably no more. Yes, one can use particle beams for their radiation effects. But I certainly wouldn’t expect to see anything like muonic computers, antiproton engines or neutrino tomography systems anytime soon. Of course, all that may change if somehow it’s figured out (and it doesn’t seem obviously impossible) how to miniaturize a particle accelerator. Over sufficiently long times, basic research has historically tended to be the very best investment one can make. And quite possibly particle physics will be no exception. But I rather expect that the great technological consequences of particle physics will rely more on the development of theory than on more results from experiment. If one figures out how to create energy from the vacuum or transmit information faster than light, it’ll surely be done by applying the theory in new and unexpected ways, rather than by using specific experimental results. The Standard Model is certainly not the end of physics. There are clearly gaps. We don’t know why parameters like particle masses are the way they are. We don’t know how gravity fits in. And we don’t know about all sorts of things seen in cosmology. But let’s say we can resolve all this. What then? Maybe then there’ll be another set of gaps and problems. And maybe in a sense there’ll always be a new layer of physics to discover. I certainly used to assume that. But from my work on A New Kind of Science I developed a different intuition. That in fact there’s no reason all the richness we see in our universe couldn’t arise from some underlying rule—some underlying theory—that’s even quite simple. There are all sorts of things to say about what that rule might be like, and how one might find it. But what’s important here is that if the rule is indeed simple, then on fundamental grounds one shouldn’t in principle need to know too much information to nail down what it is. I’m pleased that in some particular types of very low-level models I’ve studied, I’ve already been able to derive Special and General Relativity, and get some hints of quantum mechanics. But there’s plenty more we know in physics that I haven’t yet been able to reproduce. But what I suspect is that from the experimental results we have, we already know much more than enough to determine what the correct ultimate theory is—assuming that the theory is indeed simple. It won’t be the case that the theory will get the number of dimensions of space and the muon-electron mass ratio right, but will get the Higgs mass or some as-yet-undiscovered detail wrong. Now of course it could be that something new will be discovered that makes it more obvious what the ultimate theory might look like. But my guess is that we don’t fundamentally need more experimental discoveries; we just need to spend more effort and be better at searching for the ultimate theory based on what we already know. And it’s certainly likely to be true that the human and computer resources necessary to take that search a long way will cost vastly less than actual experiments in particle accelerators. And indeed, in the end we may find that the data necessary to nail down the ultimate theory already existed 50 years ago. But we won’t know for sure except in hindsight. And once we have a credible candidate for the final theory it may well suggest new particle accelerator experiments to do. And it will be most embarrassing if by then we have no working particle accelerator on which to carry them out. Particle physics was my first great interest in science. And it is exciting to see now after 40 years a certain degree of closure being reached. And to feel that over the course of that time, at first in particle physics, and later with all the uses of Mathematica, I may have been able to make some small contribution to what has now been achieved. ||||| In confirming what we already thought, the Higgs Boson discovery portends a close to a glorious chapter of particle physics. CERN Experimental physicists around the world are celebrating the discovery of the Higgs boson, which was officially announced yesterday. While many of us are trying to figure out what the Higgs boson is, and whether calling it the God particle is stupid, one of the smartest guys in the world, Stephen Wolfram, is sad. A boy genius who got his CalTech PhD at 20, Wolfram dabbled in particle physics before creating the Mathematica software package, and then WolframAlpha, a \\"computational engine\\" that debuted to considerable fanfare a few years ago. In an elegiac blog post, Wolfram notes that the discovery of the Higgs brings a lifetime (his lifetime) of physics research to a close. It confirms the \\"Standard Model,\\" which is the putative organization of the subatomic universe that scientists have been working on for decades. That might sound like a good thing, but confirming what we already thought was the case actually is actually a lot less interesting than discovering something fundamentally new. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Higgs particle is a tiny particle that scientists have been searching for over 40 years. It's like a missing puzzle piece in understanding how the universe works. Scientists believe it gives other particles their mass, or the amount of matter they have. Recently, they found evidence of this Higgs particle, which is a big deal! It helps us understand more about the little building blocks that make up everything around us. To find the Higgs particle, scientists used giant machines called particle accelerators. They cost a lot of money to build. Some people are sad because they think we might not discover anything more from the machines. Others are hopeful that we might find more interesting things in the future. Overall, the discovery of the Higgs particle is very important because it helps us know more about the universe and how it works."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Boules is a collective name for a wide range of games in which the objective is to throw or roll heavy balls (called \\"boules\\" in France, and \\"bocce\\" in Italy) as close as possible to a small target ball. - HockeyAllsvenskan (previously Allsvenskan and SuperAllsvenskan) is the second-highest league in the Swedish ice hockey system (after the SHL). As of the 201213 season, HockeyAllsvenskan has by far the highest average attendance of any second-tier league in Europe, averaging 3,227 spectators per game. Since the 200910 season, the league consists of fourteen teams. - Södertälje is a city and the seat of Södertälje Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 75,283 inhabitants in 2014. - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - Granite is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word \\"granite\\" comes from the Latin \\"granum\\", a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. By definition, granite is an igneous rock with at least 20% quartz and up to 65% alkali feldspar by volume. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color. - Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. It is related to bowls, boules and shuffleboard. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called \\"rocks\\", across the ice \\"curling sheet\\" towards the \\"house\\", a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a \\"game\\"; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each \\"end\\", which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage.

Shepseskaf was the sixth and last Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned for six to eight years starting around 2510 BC. Despite the relatively short length of his rule, he completed several construction projects and maintained civil stability in the region. He is known for his Mastaba, Mastaba el-Fara'un, which deviated from the standard pyramid shaped tombs of his predecessors. More detailed, Shepseskaf was a Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt and was the son of Pharaoh Menkaure. He is best known for constructing the Mastaba el-Fara'un, which is a rectangular funerary monument rather than a traditional pyramid. This is significant as all other Pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty had their tombs built as pyramids, demonstrating the architectural evolution of royal tombs during this period. Despite his short reign, Shepseskaf made an impact due to his aforementioned unusual tomb and the mysterious nature of his rule. The exact years and events of his reign are still subject to historical debate. He is often considered a somewhat enigmatic figure due to the scarcity of records about his reign. This has led to speculation and differing theories among Egyptologists regarding his rule and his relations with his predecessors. In conclusion, Shepseskaf carries significance in Egypt's history as a Pharaoh who broke the mold and whose legacy continues to inspire discussion and research among historians and archaeologists even today. His contributions to the culture, architecture, and history of ancient Egypt underline the importance of the continuity and change in Egyptian society during the Old Kingdom period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, Pongo sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdita. After a frantic chase through the streets and into St. James's Park, Roger and Pongo discover that Perdita likes Pongo. Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson), falls in love with Roger when they meet. After they both end up falling into the lake as a result of their dogs, they return to Roger's home, and Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdita and Pongo. Anita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil.

Anita, inspired by her dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual dalmatians and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog. Anita soon discovers that Perdita is pregnant, and is then informed that she is too, much to her shock. Some time later, Cruella visits their home, and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger.

Although the statement \\"The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742\\" provides a specific date (1742) regarding the abolition of prohibitive duties associated with the Gin Act 1736, it is not a complete or fully detailed answer to the question, \\"When were the Gin Act 1736 duties eliminated?\\" A more comprehensive and informative response would include additional details about the different measures and changes to the legislation leading up to the eventual elimination of these duties. A better answer would be: The duties imposed by the Gin Act 1736, which aimed to curb the consumption of gin in England, were not eliminated all at once, but instead underwent a series of revisions and reductions over time. The initial prohibitive tax proved to be unpopular and led to widespread evasion. In response, several amendments were made to the Gin Act throughout the 1730s and 1740s, including the Gin Act 1738 which reduced the tax rates to a more manageable level. The major milestone towards elimination of these duties was the Gin Act 1743, which significantly reformed the taxation system once again. This legislation introduced a new, less prohibitive tax, shifted the focus onto licensing retailers rather than producers, and incentivized the legal sale of gin. Under this new system, the production and consumption of gin became more regulated and better controlled. The earlier prohibitive duties associated with the Gin Act 1736 were effectively eliminated by the time this new legislation was introduced in 1743, although it is important to note that some taxes on gin remained in place. These subsequent taxes, however, were at levels that allowed for a more balanced and sustainable gin industry and a marked reduction in the social problems that had necessitated the original Gin Act."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Dialogue: W: We've all heard the saying \\"Laughter is the best medicine.\\" How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk? M: This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack. W: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example? M: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies. W: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh? M: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program. W: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public? M: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out.

Even a fake smile or laugh can benefit people physiologically just as well as a real one. This is because our body responds to the physical act of smiling or laughing, regardless of whether the emotion behind it is genuine or not. 2. We can, in fact, fool our body by pretending to be happy. When we smile or laugh, even if it's not genuine, our body still experiences the positive effects associated with the action, such as the release of endorphins and a decrease in stress hormones. 3. Our mind may be smart, but our body cannot tell the difference between a fake smile or laugh and a real one. This means that even when we're not genuinely happy, engaging in the act of smiling or laughing can still lead to a more positive state and the various health benefits it provides. In addition to these points, Dr. Berk also mentions the importance of laughter in promoting overall health and well-being. Laughter has been proven to have significant physiological effects, such as reduced stress, improved immune function, and a decrease in the risk of heart attacks. Moreover, incorporating laughter and smiling into our daily lives in the form of the Smile Time-Out program can offer an accessible way for individuals to experience these benefits without the need for strenuous exercise or other demanding activities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

December 93 BC 52 BC, on January 18 of the pre-Julian calendar) was a Roman politician known for his popularist tactics. As tribune, he pushed through an ambitious legislative program, including a grain dole, but he is chiefly remembered for his feud with Marcus Tullius Cicero and Titus Annius Milo, whose bodyguards murdered him on the Appian Way. - Catullus 85 is a poem by the Roman poet Catullus for his mistress Lesbia . \`\` Odi et amo . quare id faciam , fortasse requiris ? nescio , sed fieri sentio et excrucior . '' I hate and I love . Why do I do this , perhaps you ask ? I do not know , but I feel it happen and it is excruciating . Its declaration of conflicting feelings \`\` I hate and I love '' ( in Latin , Odi et amo ) is renowned for its force and brevity . The meter of the poem is the elegiac couplet . - A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good. - Gaius Valerius Catullus (c. 84 54 BC) was a Latin poet of the late Roman Republic who wrote in the neoteric style of poetry, which is about personal life rather than classical heroes. His surviving works are still read widely, and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art. - The Neotericoi (Greek \\"new poets\\") or Neoterics were a series of avant-garde Greek and Latin poets who wrote during the Hellenistic period (323-31 BC). Neoteric poets deliberately turned away from classical Homeric epic poetry. Rather than focusing on the feats of ancient heroes and gods, they propagated a new style of poetry through stories that operated on a smaller scale in themes and setting. The time range in which these poets wrote is sometimes called the Neoteric period. - Lesbia was the literary pseudonym used by the Roman poet Gaius Valerius Catullus (ca. 8252 BC) to refer to his lover. Lesbia is traditionally identified with Clodia, the wife of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer and sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher; her conduct and motives are maligned in Cicero's extant speech \\"Pro Caelio,\\" delivered in 56 BC. - Pro Caelio is a speech given on April 4, 56 BC, by the famed Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero in defence of Marcus Caelius Rufus, who had once been Cicero's student but more recently was a political rival. Cicero's reasons for defending Caelius are uncertain though various theories have been postulated. The \\"Pro Caelio\\" is regarded as one of the best examples of Roman oratory known, and has been so regarded throughout history. It is noteworthy as a prime example of Ciceronian oratorical technique. - Clodia (born Claudia, c. 95 or 94 BC), nicknamed Quadrantaria, and occasionally referred to in scholarship as Clodia Metelli (\\"Clodia the wife of Metellus\\"), was one of three known daughters of the ancient Roman patrician Appius Claudius Pulcher and either Caecilia Metella Balearica, or her cousin, Caecilia Metella daughter of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.

Information: - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (see mechanical filter and RF MEMS). - Phenix City is a city in Lee and Russell counties in the State of Alabama, and the county seat of Russell County. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 32,822. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Chattahoochee River forms the southern half of the Alabama and Georgia border, as well as a portion of the Florida border. It is a tributary of the Apalachicola River, a relatively short river formed by the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers and emptying from Florida into Apalachicola Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. The Chattahoochee River is about long. The Chattahoochee, Flint, and Apalachicola rivers together make up the ApalachiacolaChattahoocheeFlint River Basin (ACF River Basin). The Chattahoochee makes up the largest part of the ACF's drainage basin. - A broadcast license is a type of spectrum license granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the radio frequency spectrum in a given geographical area for broadcasting purposes. The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time.

Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\". - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them.

Select from: -yes. -it is not possible to tell. -no.","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Barik missed the northerner when he swung at him.\\" According to the given information, Barik crashed into the northerner, and his sword hit the rapier's hand-guard. This indicates that Barik did manage to make contact with the northerner, even if it wasn't an ideal or direct hit on his intended target. When Barik swung his sword, aiming for the northerner, instead of missing entirely, he hit the hand-guard protecting the northerner's hand that was holding the rapier. This may have been an intentional defensive move by the northerner to deflect or block the blow, or perhaps it was an unintentional consequence of the position and movements of the two during the confrontation. Moreover, this information suggests that the two were engaged in close combat, with Barik attempting to strike the northerner and the northerner defending himself with his rapier. Barik's sword crashing into the hand-guard of the rapier may have potentially caused some damage, be it minor or significant, to the northerner's weapon or his ability to wield it, based on the hardness of the impact. However, we do not have enough information to draw any firm conclusions in this regard. In summary, the statement \\"Barik missed the northerner when he swung at him\\" cannot be supported by the information provided.

Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder.\\" if \\"People riding their bikes.\\"?","completion":"In order to answer whether it is possible to conclude that \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder.\\" if \\"People riding their bikes.\\", it is important to analyze the context and elements within these phrases. The initial statement, \\"People riding their bikes,\\" is a fairly broad statement that encompasses various scenarios. It does not specify the number of cyclists, their intentions or motivations for riding, whether they are riding together or separately, the type of location or environment they are in, or the presence of other individuals such as onlookers. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder,\\" is quite specific and detailed. It describes a certain situation that includes several specific elements, namely: 1. There are two cyclists involved. 2. The cyclists are racing, which implies a competitive aspect. 3. The street is filled with onlookers, suggesting that this event is either organized or of general interest in the community. 4. The lead cyclist is looking over his shoulder, which could imply various things such as the lead cyclist gauging their opponent's position or possibly a concern for safety. Given the difference in the level of detail and context, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder,\\" if all we know is \\"People riding their bikes.\\" The initial statement is too general and does not provide enough information to draw the specific conclusion described. However, it is important to note that the scenario described in the second statement could very well fall under the broader umbrella of \\"people riding their bikes.\\" It is just one of many possible situations that could occur when people are riding their bikes. Nevertheless, without additional context or details, we cannot assume that the specifics of the second statement are true based solely on the first statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: * Shape the edge of the block using a drill. * Shape the edge of the block using sandpaper.","completion":"To accomplish the goal of making a rounded edge on a block of wood, I would choose the option to \\"Shape the edge of the block using sandpaper.\\" This would be the most appropriate method because sandpaper allows for a greater level of precision and control over the shaping process, making it easier to create a smooth, rounded edge on the wood. Step-by-step process: 1. Choose the appropriate sandpaper: Select a coarse grit sandpaper (80 to 120 grit) to start shaping the edge of the wood and switch to a finer grit (180 to 220 grit) once the desired level of roundness is achieved for a smoother finish. 2. Sand the edge at an angle: Hold the block of wood securely, and start sanding the edge at a 45-degree angle with the coarse sandpaper, applying even pressure as you move back and forth along the edge. 3. Round the edge: Gradually increase the angle while sanding the edge, until you reach the desired level of roundness. 4. Smooth the edge: Switch to the finer grit sandpaper and sand the rounded edge in the same manner as the coarser grit. This step helps to achieve a smooth finish and remove any remaining rough spots. 5. Clean the wood: Use a dry, clean cloth or brush to remove any sanding dust from the wood's surface and rounded edge. 6. Finish the wood: If desired, apply a wood finish such as oil or clear varnish to protect and enhance the appearance of the rounded edge and the wood block itself. By following these steps and choosing to use sandpaper, the rounded edge on the block of wood can be achieved effectively and with precision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Business leaders in Germany have expressed concerns that the country may jeopardize its position as an industrial leader if it refuses to consider exploring its shale gas reserves."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

I told him not to worry and walked up front. One person was in line ahead of me, a little girl no more than seven with a bottle of medicine on the counter . She held a little green and white coin purse closely to her chest . The purse reminded me of the days when, as a child, I liked dressing myself up in my grandma's clothes. One day, wearing her large clothes and hat, I went out to buy something. I gave a fake dollar to the shop owner, but he handed back some real coins for my purse. \\"Keep the change!\\" he told me with a smile. Now, with both hands shaking, the little girl pulled out a dollar bill and some coins for her medicine. As she tried to count her money, I could see right away that she was about a dollar short.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. I am facing a new situation today: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided and the new situation, we can deduce the following: Step 1: Understand the background article - Mutations are changes in the DNA or RNA sequence - Two types of mutations: germline and somatic - Germline mutations occur in sex cells and are potentially serious, can be passed down to the next generation - Somatic mutations occur in body cells and do not pass to offspring, but can still have potential consequences such as cancer Step 2: Apply the background information to the situation - Group L displayed all kinds of mutations - Group D did not display any mutations Step 3: Answer the question The question asks which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence. Since Group D did not display any mutations, it can be concluded that Group D had fewer changes in their RNA sequence compared to Group L. Answer: Group D had fewer changes in their RNA sequence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Article: Former President Jimmy Carter believes U.S central intelligence agency is spying on him -- so much so, he gives up email to avoid government spies. \\"You know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored,\\" Carter told NBC's Andrea Mitchell in an interview broadcast Sunday. \\"And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office and mail it. \\"I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored,\\" Carter continued. The 89-year-old said the National Security Agency and others have abused the argument that gathering intelligence is important to homeland security. \\"That has been extremely liberalized and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies,\\" Carter said. The 39th president, however, stopped short of criticizing No. 44 over the handling of the N.S.A. scandal , the crisis in Ukraine or anything else. \\"I don't have any criticism of him,\\" Carter said of Obama.

Abdul Karim, also known as the Munshi, was an Indian servant who became a close confidant and teacher of Queen Victoria, instructing her in Urdu and Indian affairs. However, some aspects of his background were falsified or exaggerated when he first arrived in England. Frederick Ponsonby was the private secretary of Edward VII when he was still Prince of Wales and an equerry, a personal attendant or officer, to Queen Victoria. He was the son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, the Queen's private secretary, and played a crucial role in unveiling the truth about the Munshi's background. Ponsonby discovered that Abdul Karim had not been truthful about his parentage and social status, and he subsequently reported his findings to Lord Elgin, the Viceroy of India at the time. In his report, Ponsonby compared Abdul Karim's role in the royal household to that of John Brown – a close personal servant of Queen Victoria whose intimate relationship with her had ignited much gossip and speculation. Although the Munshi's deception was eventually revealed, Queen Victoria remained fond of him, and he maintained an influential position within the royal household until her death in 1901."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

None of the permanent guards or guard managers would be forced to quit their employment, the company said. RMT union said it was in formal dispute with Merseyrail and its 220 members would be balloted for strike action. John Tilley, of RMT, said Merseyrail had failed to give cast iron assurances on the future of 220 guards and managers at a meeting on Wednesday, and he \\"fully expected\\" members to vote heavily for industrial action. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: \\"We will not agree to any extensions of DOO and will fight to retain the safety critical role of the guard and to keep a guard on the train.\\" He said the train operator had \\"snubbed\\" a final chance to avoid the ballot. He added it was \\"entirely preventable if the company had listened to the union's deep-seated safety concerns... and had put passenger safety before profit\\". Merseyrail said it had \\"made it clear\\" that it will look after guards and management whose roles would no longer exist once the new fleet is introduced and there would be no compulsory redundancies. The train operator said the RMT had demanded there should be a guard on every new train but the new fleet had been designed to operate without guards, and as such, it was not in a position to guarantee this.

There's a group called RMT, kind of like a club that protects the workers, and they're not happy about this. They're worried about the safety of passengers and want to keep guards on the trains.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds' £34m summer signing from Southampton reacted first to a loose ball after substitute Daniel Sturridge's shot had hit the post in the fourth of eight minutes of stoppage time. Everton, who had lost goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg to injury in the second half, have now won just one of their past 20 meetings with their local rivals. Liverpool - who moved up to second - created the better chances, with Stekelenburg and his replacement Joel Robles saving well from Roberto Firmino. There was a flashpoint in the second half when a dreadful tackle by Ross Barkley on Jordan Henderson sparked angry scenes and the Everton midfielder was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from referee Mike Dean. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's celebrations at the final whistle carried an extra edge as Mane's late strike sealed three points they desperately needed to keep in touch with Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are six points behind Antonio Conte's side and will surely take great satisfaction from digging out a vital victory that was based on grit rather than the flowing football that has been their trademark this season. The hosts' high tempo start put the Reds on the back foot but as the game went on they exerted greater control and in the end deserved the win simply for looking the more dangerous side and creating the better chances. And once again Sturridge proved how important he can be to Klopp and Liverpool's cause - despite being marginalised or injured for much of the season - with the run and shot that struck the post before Mane swooped to win the 227th Merseyside derby. Liverpool needed to bounce back from the stumbles of a shock 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth and a home draw against West Ham United. They have done so in style with away wins at Middlesbrough and now Everton. Everton's record in Merseyside derbies has been a tale of almost unbroken misery since their last win, a 2-0 win against Roy Hodgson's Liverpool in October 2010. There are, however, signs of improvement and they will feel unfortunate not to hold out here and concede so late on. For the first 45 minutes they adhered to boss Ronald Koeman's demand for a high-intensity pressing game but ran out of steam after the break, not helped by the loss of James McCarthy to injury. Substitute Gareth Barry may still possess the old guile, but sadly for him and Everton the legs are also ageing and he was miles off the pace - though his substitute appearance did take him second behind Ryan Giggs in the list of most Premier League games played. Everton also failed to give sufficient support to main marksman Romelu Lukaku and Koeman will surely be looking to address this problem in the January transfer window. There are signs that the Toffees are now moving in the right direction, despite suffering their first home Premier League defeat of the season - but Koeman still has much to do. Barkley has been the centre of much attention this season, whether as the victim of tough love from Koeman or with transfer speculation as he enters the last 18 months of his contract. Here he was centre of attention for different reasons after a late touchline lunge on his England team-mate Henderson in the second half that was somehow only punished with a yellow card. It led to angry exchanges between the players, and Henderson and Barkley also clashed later, the latter wisely not rising to the Liverpool captain's bait. Barkley's night was summed up by a wild cross into the Gwladys Street that brought a furious response from his manager. These are tough times for the talented 23-year-old midfielder. Everton manager Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \\"We are really disappointed to concede in extra time. The eight minutes killed us. \\"We have to wait to see about Maarten Stekelenburg's injury - we will know more tomorrow - and James McCarthy has a hamstring injury. \\"I know exactly how fast Sadio Mane is, he reacted so well. We did not deserve to concede this goal. \\"Maybe Ross Barkley was lucky, it was a hard tackle.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \\"I don't agree it was a poor first half. Maybe not the best football - you have to adapt to Everton's wild game. A game like this you have to interrupt their rhythm with passing. \\"In the second half it was clear they couldn't do the same. We were better, we didn't give one chance away I think. \\"The goal was not the hardest shot from Sturridge, but hard enough. It was a wonderful feeling. \\"I don't like the flares too much. I'm a little bit scared about this. It was a long, long stoppage time. We gave them no chance.\\" On Barkley's tackle on Henderson: \\"I saw it one time. Everything is clear.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I usually doubt about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago.While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, 1 was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children between 9 and 17 have a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago. Why are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place. Given that _ , adults can still do plenty to help the next generation to cope. At the top of the list,nurturing is a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress. To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later.They will then have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep. Limit the amount of virtual violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news. Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale. Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you deal with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable,but it doesn't have to ruin your life. Question: What does the author mean by saying \\" we can't turn the clock back(Para. 3)?

In the context of the article, this refers to the increasing anxiety levels in children and the factors contributing to it, such as higher divorce rates, decreased community involvement, and the perception of a more dangerous world. By saying \\"we can't turn the clock back,\\" the author acknowledges that we cannot revert to the conditions of the past when children seemingly experienced less anxiety. Instead, the focus should be on finding ways to help the current and future generations cope with the challenges and stressors they face today, by promoting stronger social connections, limiting exposure to violence, and encouraging healthy habits like exercise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I was about half in. I wait thinking he will realize it was a not so smart action and he will pull back in to let me pass since forward is an easier safer plan. He doesn't do that we sit for anout 30 seconds and he is determined to stay. I was a fairly new driver in my first car. I get irritated and shut my motor off basically saying, buddy I entered the street first you were parked never looked before you hurriedly pulled forward. So he shuts off his motor and smiled good as to say stalemate. I'm thinking I have no place I have to be, I'll wait rather than trying to back up half the block without hitting somebodies car. We wait, he gets out of his car goes into his house, no cell phone back then it was the pager (beepers) era. I wasnt sure why he was going in, but probably nit good outcome for me.

The subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern is respected and the lexical choices (nouns, verbs, and prepositions) are appropriate.

He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, car B would contribute to a less cleaner atmosphere. This is because car B is older and does not have a catalytic converter, which is responsible for converting harmful gases into less harmful substances, helping to create a cleaner atmosphere.

The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). In Old Palestine, the henna night was a night used to prepare all the necessary wedding decorations and last minute arrangements. It was also a chance for the families to celebrate together before the wedding. The groom's family would sahij or dance through the streets of the village until reaching the house of the bride. Once there, the family would mix henna together, which would then be used to decorate the bride and grooms hands (with the groom's being merely the initials of his bride and himself), and then offer the bride her mahr (usually gold as it does not decline in value like other wealth). The families would then dance and sing traditional Palestinian music. In modern times, particularly those not living in Palestine, the henna night remains traditional in customs, but is very similar to a bachelorette party; the bride's female friends and relatives join her in celebrating, which includes food, drinks, and a lot of dancing. A women's group plays Arabic music, sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or mehndi, a temporary form of skin decoration using henna, on the bride and guests' skin -- usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of keratin there, which binds temporarily to lawsone, the colorant of henna. The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration. An important element of the henna night in both traditional and non-traditional henna parties, is the dress adorned by the Palestinian women and the groom. The women dress in traditional (usually hand embroidered) gowns, known as Palestinian ithyab. The brides thobe would be extravagant and exquistely embroidered. The groom will wear the usual traditional Arab men's thobe and hata (head covering). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are the couple allowed to see each other on henna night ?","completion":"Yes, the couple is allowed to see each other on the henna night. During this celebration, the groom will enter where the bride is, and they both get their henna done together. After that, the groom will offer the bride her mahr (gift). So, they do see and spend time together during the henna night."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - A vacuum solution is a solution of a field equation in which the sources of the field are taken to be identically zero. That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero). - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta. - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe. - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation. - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature). - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe. - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy. - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others. - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

Q: Here's where I think the distinction lies - I may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes: So, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level. When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons. This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation. With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play. When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim. The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it: His claims had a major effect to divide the country. Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story. When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding. In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.

The passengers and crew are placed in hypersleep, with a rotating crew who awake for shifts of two years each maintaining the ship throughout the journey. Eight years into the mission the ship receives a transmission from Earth in multiple languages: \\"You're all that's left of us. Good luck, God bless, and godspeed.\\" Some unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, are awakened from hypersleep. Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial amnesia. The ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, which leaves them unable to enter the bridge, although they have steady power in their quarters. Bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor in case it goes critical. After suffering panic attacks from his claustrophobia he begins to suffer symptoms of \\"Orbital Dysfunction Syndrome\\", nicknamed \\"Pandorum\\", a severe psychotic illness known to appear in deep-space travellers causing delusions, paranoia, hallucinations and violence. It is known to have been the cause of the disastrous \\"'Eden' mission,\\" in which the captain of a large starship called the \\"Eden\\" became so afflicted with Pandorum that he became convinced that the flight was cursed and ejected his entire crew of 5,000 to their deaths. Bower encounters Nadia, a former geneticist and Manh, an agriculturist, and they are attacked by a group of cannibalistic pale-skinned humanoids with heightened senses of smell and strength and a seemingly tribal culture. Bower's group flees into a barricaded chamber and finds a cook named Leland, who has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and...","completion":"What were the consequences of Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton suffering from partial amnesia, and how did it affect their ability to navigate and maintain the Elysium during their mission to establish a colony on the Earth-like planet Tanis?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The album was released on September 25, 2012 and \\"Cauterize\\" was available on the band's website as a free download for a 24-hour period. As I Lay Dying won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire in 2012, beating other well-known bands, including Anthrax and Lamb of God.

We'll keep you informed as best we can.\\" They also stated that their thoughts were \\"with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.\\" Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that \\"we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted\\".

Carefully pry away baseboards and molding from the wall and pry thresholds up from any doorways with a pry bar. This method works when the damaged boards are close enough to the edge of the floor that it is possible to remove a small number of surrounding boards to get to the damaged boards and replace them.

Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.

Step 1: Take out an ice cube tray Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 2: Fill the tray with water from the faucet Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: Less effect (Assuming water is still available, solar activity would cause water to evaporate more quickly, making it harder to fill the tray but not directly affecting this step) Step 3: Put the ice cube tray in the freezer Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 4: Wait for several hours Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 5: The water will freeze and become ice Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: Less effect (With no atmosphere, the Earth's surface will be significantly colder.

Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

News article: This summer, Michael Phelps is swimming for his last time at the Olympics and collecting a few more gold medals along the way. Outside of his extensive hardware collection, Phelps has helped Under Armour and agency Droga5 hit some major milestones with his \\"Rule Yourself\\" ad, including a Film Craft Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions festival. Now it's become one of the most shared Olympics spots ever. New data from Unruly shows the Phelps Under Armour spot is now the second most shared Olympics ad for 2016—behind Channel 4's incredible Paralympics spot \\"We're The Superhumans,\\"—and the fifth most shared Olympics spot of all time. What makes the ad, created by Droga5, so sharable? For one, it's striking the right emotional chord with its target audience: millennial men between the ages of 18 and 34. The dramatic nature of the Phelps spot (with a killer track from The Kills) and its ability to take viewers through the swimmer's intense training process elicited a sense of inspiration among 47 percent of overall viewers, and 68 percent of millennial men. Twenty-two percent of viewers reported feeling amazement watching the athlete training and even undergoing some extraordinarily painful-looking sessions of cupping therapy. Millennials also felt happiness and surprise—all key emotions needed to engage younger viewers, according to Unruly. \\"Something we've learned from all of the ads we tested if we look at different demographics and the emotions that are most resonant to them, for millennials—especially male millennials—inspiration is one of the top emotions. If that is present at all in an ad, they tend to experience it,\\" Devra Prywes, VP, marketing and insight at Unruly, said. Prywes noted that the inspiration factor seemed to be lacking in a lot of Super Bowl spots from this year but stands out in many Olympics spots, which is likely helping to propel shares for the Olympic ads. To date, 56 percent of the spots' shares are coming from Facebook, followed by Twitter at 28 percent. Prywes contended that Under Armour has successfully been able to consistently create authentic spots, with stars from Misty Copeland to the U.S. Women's Gymnastics team. Each piece of work continues to inspire and amaze audiences while also building a sense of pride in viewers, according to the data. Droga5 co-head of strategy Harry Roman echoed Prywes, adding that the Phelps ad is so shareable because it's able to convey the sacrifice that the swimmer makes each day to prepare for Rio. \\"I think people connect with this film because it paints hard work and sacrifice with beautiful strokes, but does so in a way that is raw and real about what it takes to win. I would like to think that this film and the stirring lyrics, 'It's The Last Goodbye,' are playing in the back of people's minds when they see him smiling on the podium. We probably won't ever see another athlete like Michael Phelps for a very long time,\\" Roman said. Added Prywes: \\"Especially with younger viewers, over three-quarters will lose trust in a brand if an ad feels fake. Under Armour's recent campaigns are all consistently authentic. They're doing a really nice job of drawing this out and creating new content that all work really well together in their content stack, in this authentic way of portraying athletes and their origin stories, showing the things that you don't always see.\\" Take a look at some additional data from Unruly below. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Read this and answer the question The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC, but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus (29 BC – 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (castra) as Aquis Querquennis, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (viae) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of Romanization.

However, in this ever-changing industry, maintaining one's image and reputation is of utmost importance. To this end, Cruise has decided to bring in a professional Hollywood insider to manage his publicity, replacing his sister, Lee Anne DeVette. Lee Anne DeVette had been the source of Cruise's thriving public image for many years, as she diligently worked behind the scenes to steer her brother's career in the right direction. Cruise had been relying on family support to maintain his public persona, but with the growing complexities of the Hollywood landscape and Tom Cruise's increasing stardom, it became evident that a change was necessary. DeVette's time managing Cruise's publicity saw her showcasing her ability to handle the ins and outs of the entertainment business, but as her brother's trajectory continues to skyrocket, Cruise has chosen to place her energy on a different mission. In comes the professional Hollywood insider, a figure skilled at dealing with the intricacies of Tinseltown's fast-paced game. This decision to shift gears and hire a specialist in public relations stems from a need to further elevate Cruise's reputation to a higher level.

This change will ensure better crisis management, improved interactions with the media, and robust strategies to maximize his reach and allure.

However, the business of Hollywood requires a keen understanding of the various key players and strategic moves, something that professional publicists are trained to navigate with finesse. Cruise's dedication to his craft is mirrored in his investment in a high-profile publicist who will assure that his image remains untarnished and respected. This decision further showcases the value of hiring a competent and seasoned publicist to navigate the often treacherous waters of Hollywood. The role of publicists in managing the image and public perception of their clients is more significant than ever, given the proliferation of social media and intensified scrutiny from the public eye. Cruise's choice to invest in a publicist who is well-connected within the Hollywood network demonstrates foresight and a keen understanding of the importance of an unblemished reputation in the film industry. In conclusion, Tom Cruise's decision to replace his sister with a professional Hollywood insider as his publicist is a strategic move that mirrors the direction of modern Hollywood. As the industry evolves, public relations play a heightened role in the success of celebrities and the upkeep of their image. This change ensures that Cruise's stellar career remains on track, and his relationship with the media continues to promote his image in the best possible light.

Rock Contextually and logically, among the provided options (tree, garden, meadow, rock, rug), the most sensible item to use for smashing a large, frightening bug when you're outdoors would be a rock. A rock is a commonly found object outdoors, that fits within the human hand, and has the sufficient weight and solidity to eliminate a bug. A. Picking up a tree would be not just practically impossible for a human due to its large size and firmly rooted structure, but also excessive for the task. B. A garden is not something you can 'grab'. It's a large, immovable area filled with plants, flowers, and sometimes accessory structures like benches or fountains. C. A meadow is also a large piece of land that is often covered in grass and wildflowers, and it again, cannot be 'grabbed' or used to smash a bug. E. While a rug could theoretically be used to squash a bug, bearing in mind the setting provided i.e., outdoors, it is unlikely you would have a rug to hand. Even if you did, it is less effective than other options due to its flexibility and softness. Hence, a rock appears to be the most practical choice for this particular task.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. I am facing a new situation today: Two sisters went to the doctor to get screened for cancer. Lisa had cancer, while her sister Beth didn't. Lisa was terrified, but her sister comforted her. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sister had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably? A:","completion":"Based on the knowledge you acquired from the background article, Beth is the sister who had fewer abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Lisa was diagnosed with cancer, while her sister Beth was not. Cancer occurs when cells in the body begin to divide abnormally and uncontrollably due to mutations in genes that control the cell cycle. These abnormal cells can form a mass known as a tumor, which can potentially harm healthy tissues surrounding it. In the case of the two sisters, Lisa had cancer, meaning her body had experienced this uncontrolled cell division and likely formed a tumor. On the other hand, Beth did not have cancer, which indicates her cells were not dividing uncontrollably, at least not to the extent that it resulted in cancer. Therefore, Beth is the sister who had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Sydney got very angry and their friend's suggestion and beat them severely.

Q:This article: One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory.

Review: a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as having a negative connotation. The reviewer seems to be criticizing the film for its overly safe approach and lack of creative risks. They use phrases like \\"nice 'n safe\\" and \\"milquetoast movie of the week\\" to describe the film, which suggest that the movie is bland, generic, and not innovative enough to merit a big-screen release. The term \\"milquetoast\\" is a slang term often employed to describe something that is weak, timid, or lacking in character. In the context of the review, this word implies that the film lacks substance and fails to leave a strong or memorable impression on the audience. Furthermore, comparing the movie to a \\"movie of the week\\" suggests that it has a quality level more suited for TV movies, which are typically lower-budget and less artistically ambitious than theatrical releases. This statement implicates that the film does not meet the higher expectations typically associated with big-screen productions. Overall, this movie review sentence is quite negative, as it conveys disappointment in the film's unimaginative approach and limited ambition. The reviewer implies that the movie might be forgettable and not worth the attention usually reserved for larger, more engaging films that have left more significant impacts on the audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County.

This is the astonishing moment holidaymakers watched wild dolphins put on a show for them just yards away from a Cornish beach. Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming. Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving last Friday. Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: ‘It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw. 'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.’ Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to 21C (70F) over the weekend. Mrs Drabble said lifeguards eventually managed to encourage the dolphins away from swimmers, with the help of a helicopter. Scroll down for video. Impressive: Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming on Friday. Watching: Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving beneath the waves. Hot weather: Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to the 21C over the weekend. ¿Breathtaking¿: People on the beach in Cornwall were said to have been cheering as the dolphins jumped out of the water. Time to leave: Lifeguards urged people to stay away from the dolphins, before a helicopter was used to encourage them to swim back out into open water. Some 28 species of cetacean have been recorded in UK waters, with 11 of these regularly appearing, according to Government figures. Dolphins can be viewed from places such as Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth near Inverness, as well as Cardigan Bay in Wales. They can also be seen around Land's End in Cornwall from January to April, as well as on the east coast of Scotland between July and September. It is illegal under British law to intentionally kill or injure a dolphin, or ‘recklessly disturb’ one - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat. Fishermen with larger vessels are obliged to fit acoustic deterrent devices to deter dolphins from approaching them, and reducing by-catch levels. They are also advised to reel in their lines if dolphins appear while fishing, before moving away from an area if the cetaceans do not leave first. Dolphins are powerful animals that can become aggressive towards humans, and it can be harmful for both parties if people attempt feeding. Two decades ago US officials had to issue guidance on this subject after people were seen in Florida feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs and sweets. It is recommended that people get no closer than 50 yards to dolphins, because they can feel harassed if you get too close to them. In addition, dolphins have delicate skin which is very sensitive to human touch and therefore can be at risk of harm from humans. Warmer sees could be behind a rise for a change in the type of dolphins spotted off the North East, a survey suggested four years ago. A rise in sightings of common, bottlenose and Risso's dolphins - associated with warmer waters - was reported by the North East Cetacean Project. Among the cetaceans whose numbers sighted off the UK have increased over the past 30 years are the common dolphin and striped dolphin.","completion":"1.

Such devices are crucial to industries like woodworking, metalworking, and manufacturing of various components, where high levels of accuracy and consistency are required. By utilizing template devices in these processes, manufacturers can produce numerous identical pieces with minimal variations. Some common examples of template devices include jigs, fixtures, and various clamping systems. Jigs are specialized tools used to guide and control the movement of a tool relative to the workpiece. Fixtures, on the other hand, are used for holding and supporting the workpiece while a specific operation is performed. Clamping systems, as the name suggests, secure the workpiece in its position, making sure it does not move or shift during the machining process. Overall, the translation emphasizes the importance of template devices in various manufacturing contexts, where precise and accurate machining is crucial for producing high-quality end products.

The fact that Hugh Grosvenor’s estate is held in a trust means that his £9bn inheritance is likely to remain largely intact Had the Grosvenor estate bequeathed to the new Duke of Westminster been liable for 40% inheritance tax, the amount owed to the Treasury would have been not far off the government’s entire death duty take for the last financial year. Hugh Grosvenor, however, avoids a significant cut to his £9bn inheritance because the estate is held in a trust. Britain’s generous trust law ensures that the country’s largest fortunes are largely kept intact. This is borne out by statistics which show that duties are a modest source of revenue for the Treasury. HMRC collected total tax of £534bn in 2015-16, of which inheritance tax receipts represented £4.7bn. New Duke of Westminster inherits £9bn fortune aged 25 Read more “The benefits of trusts are that they don’t form part of somebody’s estate,” says Ian Dyall, a manager at the financial adviser Towry. “In a discretionary trust, you have a whole pick list of potential beneficiaries which the trustees can choose to appoint benefits to. Because of that, you can’t point a finger to any potential beneficiary and say that’s your money. Money can stay in the trust and cascade down from generation to generation and nobody pays inheritance tax on it.” Instead of one-off taxation, trusts are subject to charges every 10 years from the anniversary of their creation. Known as the inheritance tax periodic charge, it can amount to 6% of the funds held. There are, however, plenty of loopholes. Agricultural and business property relief applies, and the Grosvenor assets will have been managed to take full advantage of that. The estate has been divided into three portfolios: Grosvenor Facebook Twitter Pinterest Eaton Square in central London is the jewel of the 300-year-old Grosvenor estate. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA The privately owned property business has £11.8bn in assets under management. At its heart is the 300-year-old Grosvenor estate in London, which began in 1677 as 500 acres of land including Mayfair and Belgravia. Its holdings range from hi-tech office space in Silicon Valley and a science park in Edinburgh to the freehold on the current US embassy in Grosvenor Square. The jewel is Eaton Square, built close to Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament during the housing boom that followed the Napoleonic wars. Run as a separate legal entity with its own chief executive, Grosvenor Group paid £58m in tax on profits of £527m in 2015, and has 520 employees on its payroll. Its holdings are largely expected to qualify for relief from the inheritance tax periodic charge. “Property is at the frontline over what qualifies and what doesn’t,” said Dyall. “If you run a hotel, that’s a business. If you have a rental property and all you do is collect the rent, that’s not a trading company. That’s an investment.” Wheatsheaf Set up in 2012, Wheatsheaf employs 450 people and invests in food, energy and water security. It runs Grosvenor Farms, one of the largest farms in the UK with more than 6,000 acres in Cheshire and a herd of 1,400 dairy cows. Other businesses include the UK’s largest bull stud, Cogent Breeding, and a hydroelectric plant on the Reay Forest estate in Scotland. With its emphasis on food production, job creation and trading rather than land holding, Wheatsheaf assets are also likely to be exempt from the inheritance tax periodic charge.

It is not a windfall that the young man would have wished for so soon, and follows the sudden death of his father, the sixth duke of Westminster. The late duke was the third richest man in the country and 68th in the world, according to the Forbes billionaires list. Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor became unexpectedly ill on Tuesday on one of the family’s estates near Lancashire in the north of England. He died later in the hospital at the age of 64. The younger Grosvenor will now inherit a portfolio of properties that span vast swaths of central London’s most exclusive neighborhoods, including Belgravia and Mayfair. He is the third of four siblings but the only son in the family, making him the heir to the family empire under the now-defunct law of primogeniture, which means men can supersede women to inheritance, regardless of age. Until now, the new billionaire has managed to live his life largely out of the public spotlight despite being born with the title of earl. He is not well known to the British public, and one of the only times he made headlines was for his lavish 21st “black tie and neon”-themed birthday party at the family’s main ancestral home, Eaton Hall. It reportedly cost around £5 million (6.5 million) and was attended by 800 guests, including Prince Harry, who were asked to make a contribution to the young man's wine collection instead of a birthday gift. He attended Newcastle University, where he studied countryside management and earned a reputation among friends for being down to earth. Photos have appeared in the British press in recent days showing him partying with friends much like any other young man. In one image he is wearing a pink teddy bear onesie at a costume party. After graduation, he first worked in estate management for the family company, the Grosvenor Group, then took up his current job as an account manager at bio-bean, a coffee recycling firm that turns waste coffee grounds into advanced biofuels. Despite attempts to lead an ordinary life, the family moves in some of Britain’s most aristocratic circles and has strong ties to the royal family. Grosvenor’s mother, Natalia, is godmother to Prince William and he was named godfather to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s firstborn, Prince George, in 2013. “I do feel sorry for Hugh,” Prince William said. “He will be under enormous pressure. He's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he'll need to be robust mentally to survive. There are many pitfalls, when one inherits such an enormous amount of money, especially in adolescence.” Grosvenor's parents did not like the British private school system and the four children were given a different upbringing than many of Britain’s wealthiest young people. They were not sent to exclusive private boarding schools like Eton or Harrow but attended a state primary school followed by a private day school. The late duke of Westminster was well known for his philanthropic acts and charitable values, which he actively sought to instill in his children.

Now his son will oversee the Westminster Foundation, which is the grant-making body that looks after the estate's philanthropic giving. It has handed more than £40 million (52 million) in grants to more than 1,500 charitable organizations since 1974, a legacy that the young man will have to strive to live up to. “My main object will be to teach him self-discipline and a sense of duty,” the late duke said of his son. “He's been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can't go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given. He has to see himself as a caretaker, keeping the estates in good shape in his lifetime.” Boyle is a special correspondent.

Given the question: Question: \\"What is not prominent?\\" Context: \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The urinary bladder and external urethral opening are not prominent in birds, as they excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine, and do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “Beatlebone,” the strange and exhilarating new novel by the Irish writer Kevin Barry, is about John Lennon — kind of. It follows him closely for around 200 pages, through a few comically calamitous days in 1978, as he travels through western Ireland to an island off its coast, bought on a lark 11 years earlier. He’s nearing 40 here; past drugs, past scream therapy, far past the Beatles, and stripped raw emotionally, tired “but not for sleeping,” full of “large sad warmish feelings.” A few days alone on his island, he hopes, will bring him the peace that even marriage and fatherhood, though he loves them, haven’t. The poignant knowledge that this is an end-of-life crisis, not a middle-of-life one: That belongs to us, not to him. These first 200 pages are nearly perfect, observant, melancholy but not mournful, and tremendously funny, largely because John’s endearingly lofty vision of his trip’s purpose, a communion with nature and himself, runs immediately into very practical problems. For starters he has trouble simply finding his island; the local fixer taking care of him, a man named Cornelius who is incapable of fixing anything, doesn’t have a great idea of how to get there. He tries anyway, leading his famous charge through a series of misadventures, as they dodge journalists, visit the pub in disguise and become stranded in a derelict hotel with a few holdovers from the hippie era. And then another character enters the book: Mr. Barry himself. Suddenly it’s 2011, and we’re inside his head as he stands “with all the other hunched pilgrims” outside the Dakota in New York, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and was killed. Mr. Barry realizes something. “If I was going to make beatlebone everything it should be,” he writes, “I needed to get to the island.” And so he sets off. This gesture is at least as old as Laurence Sterne — “baring the device,” literary critics named it nearly a century ago — but in this context it feels startling, even risky, because “Beatlebone” would have been an excellent novel without it, a tender portrait of a man “37 years along the road — the slow-quick, slow-quick road,” as the novel puts it in a typically lovely, darting line. And yet the risk pays off. The hallmark of Mr. Barry’s previous fiction has been his remarkable gift as a stylist; in his only other novel, the much-honored “City of Bohane,” a slangy tale about a gang war in the near future, a glance could be a “lamp,” a “check,” a “sconce” — quick-witted coinages at once low and literary, in that peculiar, flexible Irish fashion. But “City of Bohane” was also, in its thinner moments, filmic in the wrong ways, like a Quentin Tarantino reboot of “West Side Story,” its violence and lurking sentimentality correlated. “Beatlebone” is far more profound. Mr. Barry’s language is still poetic and reaching and imaginative, but now in effortless service to more substantial themes, in particular love and “the way that time moves.” As the novel’s attention alternates between Mr. Barry’s real trip to the island and John’s made up one, the identities of the two men — both artists, both marked by the loss of their mothers — mingle, until their stories begin to overlap more and more exactly, and finally the two become indivisible, ghosts of each other across the decades. The effect is beautiful, reminiscent at different moments of Virginia Woolf and Geoff Dyer, especially the ambiguous narrator of Mr. Dyer’s wonderful novel “Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.” Yet it also leaves lingering a significant question, which is how close this book, as it moves further away from John Lennon, actually ever got us to him. Or is that the author’s point: that any work about an artist is in some sense a self-investigation, and that to introduce yourself into the narrative is the most honest way to admit that? I happen to love the Beatles, so ardently that I sometimes think that if I could preserve the work of any artists from the last century, shipping it down into the care of our descendants, it would be theirs. Which means, of course, loving John Lennon. “Beatlebone” faultlessly captures Lennon’s acidic, self-loathing, yearning, weary side. (And his sense of humor, too, an essential element: “Do you have a reservation?” a hotel clerk asks him. “I have severe ones,” he replies, “but I do need a room.”) What Mr. Barry finds more elusive is the other part of John, which remained innocent enough to create the luminous songs he wrote throughout the 1970s. So when John says late in “Beatlebone,” “I think we should all love and ravish each other but I’m holding out no great hopes,” it’s as if Mr. Barry really were the one speaking, with a novelist’s appreciation for the complex messed-up-ness of the world. John Lennon always did seem to hold out great hopes. Even as the journeys of the author and his protagonist merge, Mr. Barry and Lennon remain stubbornly distinct. But perhaps what ultimately makes this a great novel is its author’s exploration of the ways that sometimes, in art, we do get to become each other — kind of.

This is because Wolf Island showed lots of evidence for natural selection, which is the process where beneficial heritable traits become more common in a population.

However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings.

She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries?

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load? , can you please find it? After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,...

You may have read some of the scary research recently that links parabens (a preservative ingredient found in loads of health and beauty products) with breast cancer, and whilst there is no evidence yet to prove that using parabens causes breast cancer more and more people are choosing to ditch parabens in favour of something more natural. I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk. According to the above context, answer the following question. What brand is has paraben-free deordorant? The answer is:","completion":"Soft & Gentle is the brand that has a paraben-free deodorant.

Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a moving company in Brooklyn. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her constantly fighting parents and also caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. Cindy and Dean meet at Cindy's grandmother's nursing home while Dean is delivering a new resident's furniture and they begin dating afterwards. Cindy discovers she is pregnant, and tells Dean that the baby is most likely not his, as her ex-boyfriend Bobby didn't use protection. Dean asks Cindy whether or not she wants to keep the baby. At an abortion clinic, Cindy decides at the last moment to cancel the procedure, and on a bus ride home, Dean tells her he doesn't mind if the child is not his, and that he wants to begin a family with her. Before the wedding, Bobby finds out about Dean, and beats him up. Five years later, the couple lives in rural Pennsylvania with their daughter Frankie. Dean works at painting houses while Cindy is a nurse at a clinic. One evening, Dean insists on taking Cindy out for a romantic getaway at a motel so they can have some time off from their preoccupied lives, much to Cindy's reluctance. While buying wine in a liquor store, Cindy sees Bobby, who asks Cindy if she has ever cheated on her husband. She hesitates, but eventually says no. In the car, Cindy and Dean get into an argument when she mentions seeing Bobby again. At the motel, they continue fighting during sex. Cindy is called away early in the morning to work at the clinic, and she leaves a note for Dean. At the clinic, Cindy's boss, Dr. Feinberg, talks to her about a position he had offered her, and asks if she would move closer to work, suggesting that they would be able to spend time together on weekends. Visibly upset, Cindy says she previously thought he was offering her the position because she was good at her job.

Severed was not. It was worse. (spoilers - who cares?) My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the \\"this sucks\\" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two or three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a \\"specialist\\" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this \\"specialist\\" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - or possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, \\"Pulp Fiction\\"esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick) they discuss \\"the new stadium\\" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with \\"Satan\\" - is actually a \\"Loki\\"-like trickster god. In other words, he doesn't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa. Not to mention, if he's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, he wouldn't go around cutting off heads, he'd get some good rum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is \\"spooky\\") they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - \\"The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love...\\" and all that nonsense?)

The game and its sequel ( Cybersphere Plus ) have recently been released as freeware by the designer . It was designed by Clay Hellman and published by Psycon Software . Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work . - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights. - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same. - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader. - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls. - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles. - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks. - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a benefit and can be used at a time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND' in \\"Bubble Bobble\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years? from the following article ? Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, \\"Glorious John\\", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: \\"For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.\\" Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz, \\"there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, there was a conductor!'\\"Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: \\"We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events.\\" Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, \\"it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade.\\" He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.
