Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Q: Sex-linked traits are located on genes on what chromosomes? A: A:","completion":"Sex-linked traits are located on genes found on the sex chromosomes, which are designated as X and Y chromosomes in humans and most mammals. The X chromosome is larger and carries more genes, while the Y chromosome is smaller and carries fewer genes. When a trait is linked to one of these sex chromosomes, it is referred to as a sex-linked trait. Most sex-linked traits are X-linked, meaning the gene responsible for the trait is located on the X chromosome. Because females have two X chromosomes (XX) while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), X-linked traits have different patterns of inheritance in males and females. Males are more likely to express X-linked recessive traits, as they only have one X chromosome. If a male inherits a gene for a recessive trait on his X chromosome, he will express that trait because he does not have another X chromosome with a dominant allele to mask the recessive one. On the other hand, females can be carriers of X-linked recessive traits without expressing them if they have one dominant and one recessive allele on their two X chromosomes. Y-linked traits, also known as holandric traits, are those that are exclusively located on the Y chromosome. These traits are only present in males and are passed from fathers to their sons. Y-linked traits are much rarer than X-linked traits, mostly because the Y chromosome carries fewer genes. Some examples of Y-linked traits include male-specific gene patterns, such as male pattern baldness and certain forms of male infertility."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The mystery cult to Bacchus followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC. Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium: temples were dedicated to Juventas (Hebe) in 191 BC, Diana (Artemis) in 179 BC, Mars (Ares) in 138 BC), and to Bona Dea, equivalent to Fauna, the female counterpart of the rural Faunus, supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia.

No Martialist would dream of poisoning his blood and besotting his brain with alcohol in any form.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article:Since becoming the world's number one side in the summer of 2011, they have lost seven of their 12 Test matches, with their batting, bowling and fielding deteriorating. Following the series defeat by South Africa that cost them top spot, then-captain Andrew Strauss said that England had preferred to be chasing the summit of the world rankings, rather than trying to defend it. In six Tests in Asia this year, they have only made more than 200 runs in their first innings on two occasions and you will not win many Test matches with a record like that Read more from Alec Stewart That is something that goes with the territory. When you are at the top, teams raise their game to play against you, breathing down your neck because they want what you have. England clearly never got to grips with that and since then they have not been getting enough runs, not bowling well enough and they have dropped too many catches. It is a decline that began when they went to the UAE and lost 3-0 to Pakistan. That loss took them by surprise, denting their confidence at the same time. Since then, they have had the Kevin Pietersen issue cast a shadow over what was ultimately a disappointing summer and they have fretted about playing spin, knowing that the trip to India was looming. Despite all that, the scale of the defeat in Ahmedabad still comes as a surprise. Yes, England still had slim hopes of saving the match at the beginning of the fifth day, but it was actually a very one-sided contest. Media playback is not supported on this device To lose their final five wickets before lunch was disappointing, but always the most likely outcome. Of course, much was made of the make-up of England's side, particularly the decision to leave out spinner Monty Panesar, and selection issues will again come under the spotlight in the run-up to the second Test in Mumbai, which begins on Friday. For us outside the team, it's very easy to sit back and say the batsmen should score runs and the bowlers should take the wickets. It will be much more difficult than that for captain Alastair Cook. For example, I have seen it suggested that Steven Finn, if fit, could come in for Stuart Broad. If Panesar also came into the side, that would push Graeme Swann up to number eight, having been number 10 in the first Test. Can they really go into a Test match with such a long tail, especially when scoring runs in Asia has been England's biggest problem? When the ball turns in the subcontinent, the tail can be disposed of very quickly, as happened on the fifth morning in Ahmedabad. In addition, any changes to the attack would only mask the bigger problem, which has been scoring runs. One definite absentee from the next match will be Ian Bell, who is returning home for the birth of his child. I've got nothing against any sportsman being there to see their children being born, but the fact that Bell has come out for one Test has rather backed England into a corner. It's created a problem in that Bell had valuable practice time in the warm-up matches then played in the first Test, leaving England now having to turn to someone who won't have batted properly for 10 days or so. For the batsmen that do play in Mumbai, they simply have to perform better than they did here. They should follow the example of Cook and Matt Prior, who proved that runs can be scored against the India spinners. Ultimately, England have to up their game in every department if they are to have any chance of getting back in this series.

Choice is a tool - not a cult or a marketing scheme or a spiritual movement - to help identify what limits you in what you would like to accomplish in your life and how to become more effective in order to have the results you want. A central tenet is that better relationships and connections with people in all sections of your life will make your life richer. It's not rocket science, it's just common sense.

The BBC has excerpts from the video here.","completion":"Title: Basque Separatist Group ETA Declares Ceasefire: A New Chapter for Spanish-Basque Relations? The Basque separatist group ETA has declared a ceasefire, according to BBC reports, marking a significant change for the group, which has been fighting for Basque independence for over 40 years. This campaign has led to the deaths of over 820 individuals since it began. The ceasefire declaration comes after statements from the Spanish government that it would not engage in negotiations with ETA unless the group renounced violence. In response, ETA released a video outlining its intentions to embark on a \\"democratic process\\" and cease carrying out armed actions as it continues to campaign for independence. The ceasefire marks the third such declaration from ETA, with the previous two eventually being abandoned. ETA, in existence since 1959, has been considered as a terrorist organization by the Spanish government and many other international governments. The group has utilized violence in the past, targeting government officials, politicians, and military personnel in its quest to create an independent Basque Country which encompasses areas in both Spain and France. The move towards a ceasefire is a significant development in the group's history. In their video declaration, three representatives of ETA explicitly stated their intention not to “carry out armed actions” as they continue to push for Basque independence. This shift from violent tactics to a focus on diplomacy reflects the increasing pressure on the group to change its methods. Several factors have contributed to this decision from ETA. Leading members of the group have been arrested recently, weakening its capacity to operate effectively. As the group's strength and influence has dwindled, more Basque political parties have called for a cessation of violence, recognizing the high human cost to the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, the Spanish government has maintained a strict no-negotiation stance with ETA until the group unequivocally renounces violence. The previous two ceasefires declared by ETA have ended in failure, but there are reasons to be hopeful that this third attempt might prove successful. One significant factor contributing to optimism is that this is the first time ETA representatives have publically announced their intentions to abandon violent actions on video. Additionally, the increased pressure from both Basque and Spanish political forces for a peaceful resolution to the conflict could push the group towards maintaining this ceasefire. That said, it is vital to approach this recent development with cautious optimism. The Spanish government has not yet shifted its position from its no-negotiation policy, and there are concerns that without meaningful dialogue, the ceasefire may not endure. Additionally, the group's earlier record of abandoning previous ceasefires raises questions about the longevity of this declaration. In conclusion, the announcement of a ceasefire by ETA marks a potential turning point for Basque relations with the Spanish government. The cessation of violence is a necessary first step towards the possibility of a democratic resolution to the conflict. However, the success of this ceasefire hinges on the commitment of both parties to engage in meaningful negotiations and a mutual willingness to compromise. Moving forward, it is important to remain cautiously hopeful while monitoring the situation to ensure the potential for peace in the Basque region materializes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Responding to a question about what experiences prepared him for the presidency, Trump first touted his history as a businessman, before donning his media critic hat. “I’ve always seem to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media,” Trump explained. “Throughout my whole life, somebody will explain someday why.” “As a businessman I was always treated really well by the press,” he reminisced, before turning on the ire: “And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be,” he declared, as his comments were met with a brief spurt of loud boos. Always one to read a room, Trump added: “Overall, the bottom line, somebody said they couldn’t be that bad because here we are, we’re president.” Washington Post writer Ishaan Tharoor said on Twitter that the culprits of the booing were foreign journalists attending the Q&A: Foreign journos sitting next to me booed Trump’s attack on the press. — Ishaan Tharoor (@ishaantharoor) January 26, 2018 Watch above, via CNN.

Larry Elliott writes: Donald Trump took his battle with the media onto the global stage when he used a speech in Davos declaring that America was open for business to accuse his press and TV critics of being mean, vicious and purveyors of fake news. Part of the normally respectful audience of business leaders, politicians, academics and media representatives at the World Economic Forum responded to the president’s renewed onslaught on his media critics by hissing. Speaking to a packed hall, the US president boasted of his record since entering the White House and stressed that there had never been a better time for firms to hire and build in the low tax and red-tape cutting economy he was creating. Trump made his address as the latest US growth figures showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017, weaker than the 3% Wall Street had been expecting. “The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America”, he said. “I’m here to deliver a simple message.

We're about to find out, as the popular new pontiff makes his first real foray into global politics today, hosting the Russian president at the Vatican. In a closed-door meeting, Francis intends to press Putin on what Russia can do about the situation in Syria, sources tell the Daily Beast. Syria has been a major preoccupation for Francis, and he's made clear that he'd like to see Russia intervene. But he's also backed up Russia in its opposition to outside military intervention, Phil Black at CNN points out. The visit could also help heal the rift between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches. The head of the latter met with a major archbishop in Moscow last week in preparation for the visit, and emerged saying that \\"our historic differences should stop playing the critical role they have played in relations between our churches,\\" the Moscow Times reports.","completion":"Title: Pope Francis and Vladimir Putin: The Unlikely Duo Aiming to Shape Syria's Future Pope Francis, known for his uniquely compassionate approach to global issues, is stepping into the realm of international politics as he meets with Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, at the Vatican behind closed doors. It's their \\"shared interest in Syria's future that brings them together,\\" and Francis has evidently been trying to play an influential role in easing any resistance Putin may have had concerning the situation in Syria. Although differing in ideologies, the two leaders' collaborative effort could potentially signal the beginning of healing the longstanding rift between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches. Syria has been a significant concern for Pope Francis, prompting his efforts to seek assistance from the nation possessing a critical role in finding a solution — Russia. As a powerful global player, Russia has direct influence in the Middle East. Pope Francis has emphasized that Russian intervention is essential for any potential solution to the Syrian crisis. Since 2011, Syria has spiraled into a bloody, devastating civil war. As millions have been forced to flee their homes, numerous factions vie for power, leading to a genuine international catastrophe. This collaboration may seem a bit odd, given the differing ideologies; Pope Francis is a beacon of compassion and peace, serving as a spiritual guide to millions worldwide and often advocating for peaceful resolutions even to the most pressing political issues. President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation, on the other hand, is a prominent global leader with a no-nonsense, pragmatic approach, tenacious when it comes to securing Russia's best interests. Yet, it seems their shared desire for a better future for the suffering people of Syria is outshining their individual differences. This coming together could also lead to the mending of the relationship between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches, fractured for roughly 1,000 years. Interestingly, the Russian Orthodox Church has already taken significant steps towards embracing this potential partnership. Just last week, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church met with a major archbishop in Moscow. Emerging from the meeting, the Orthodox Church leader expressed that the \\"historic differences should stop playing the critical role they have played in relations between our churches,\\" according to the Moscow Times. It seems that the unprecedented meeting between these two powerful figures may indeed turn out to have significant consequences on multiple fronts. Firstly, their cooperation could affect the search for a viable resolution to the Syrian civil war. Secondly, it has the promising potential to foster positive transformations in inter-faith relations, long hindered by a thousand-year-old rift between two major global Christian denominations. Despite the differences in their beliefs, the collaboration of Pope Francis and President Putin demonstrates an incredible potential for cooperation and joint efforts in promoting peace, stability, and a brighter future for not only the conflicted Syrian people, but also for the entire world. As this meeting pans out behind closed doors, one can only hope that the unity and shared aspirations of these two global leaders will serve as an inspiration and catalyst for change."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the bridge that opened with a ceremony? from the following article ?

The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures.

Under the bill, patients would purchase marijuana from four regional dispensaries.

Many medical marijuana supporters balked at Hassan's requests, but said it is important to pass a medical marijuana bill this session. \\"This legislation is long overdue and comes as a relief to the many seriously ill patients throughout New Hampshire who will benefit from safe access to medical marijuana,\\" said Matt Simon, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project. \\"Those suffering from debilitating conditions like cancer and multiple sclerosis deserve legal, safe, and reliable access to medical marijuana.\\" Lawmakers have approved medical marijuana in the past, only to have former Gov.

Question: Who is in command of the weather station? Movie title: The Navy vs. the Night Monsters Movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.

Question: Who does Evan stop from molesting Kayleigh Movie plot title: The Butterfly Effect Movie plot: In the year 1998, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who suffered severe sexual abuse and traumas as a boy (played by Logan Lerman) and a teenager (played by John Patrick Amedori), blacks out frequently, often at moments of high stress. While entertaining a girl in his dorm room, he finds that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he travels back in time, and he is able to \\"redo\\" parts of his past, thereby causing the blackouts he experienced as a child. There are consequences to his choices, however, that then propagate back to his present life: his alternate futures vary from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).The actions he takes, and those he enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good his actions have unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternate timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. Ultimately, he decides that his attempts to alter the past end up only harming those he cares about. But Evan realizes that the main cause of everyone's suffering in all the different timelines is himself.At the conclusion of the film, Evan purposely travels back in time one final time to the first day he met Kayleigh. By scaring her away, he makes sure that she is never a part of his life, and thus finally succeeds in saving her life.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this. A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly.\\" Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex, although many are trying to find homes elsewhere. \\"The new apartments (they were provided) were not in very good shape. That's actually one of the claims,\\" he said.

It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe. - The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North-West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or \\"fells\\") and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets. - Thirlmere is a reservoir in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria and the English Lake District. It runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of two former natural lakes (or - on a different analysis - a single lake with a narrow fordable waist). In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating a reservoir to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct. The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain.

Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north. - Helvellyn (\\"pale yellow moorland\\") is a mountain in the English Lake District, the highest point of the Helvellyn range, a north-south line of mountains to the north of Ambleside, between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater. - Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District . It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, at the turn of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \\"school\\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the \\"Edinburgh Review\\". They are considered part of the Romantic Movement. - Ullswater is the second largest lake in the English Lake District, being approximately nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m) wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than . Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes; it has been compared to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland and it is a popular tourist destination. It is a typical Lake District narrow \\"ribbon lake\\" formed after the last ice age when a glacier scooped out the valley floor and when the glacier retreated, the deepened section filled with meltwater which became a lake. A total of three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills. - William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798). - Ambleside is a town in Cumbria, in North West England. Historically within the county of Westmorland, it is situated at the head of Windermere, England's largest water. The town is within the Lake District National Park. - The Eastern Fells are a group of hills in the English Lake District. Centred on Helvellyn they primarily comprise a northsouth ridge running between Ullswater and Lakeland's Central Valley. - The Helvellyn range is the name given to a part of the Eastern Fells in the English Lake District, \\"fell\\" being the local word for \\"hill\\". The name comes from Helvellyn, the highest summit of the group. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland.

Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest, recreation, and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face-down in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense. They don't hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body. The town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness. Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast. The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised). Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to. The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production. I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein.

Article: House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said on Sunday that evidence points toward Chinese involvement in a federal data breach earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT “I believe, in my judgment, that all threat indicators point to China,” McCaul told host John Dickerson on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “In my judgment, China was responsible for this.” “This is the most significant data breach in U.S. history,” he added. The White House revealed on Thursday that hackers had exposed the private data of 4 million current and former federal employees last April. McCaul said on Sunday that the cyberattack’s target, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), likely indicated that hackers had intelligence gains in mind. “It was perhaps nation-state sponsored because of the way it was done,” he said. “It was done for espionage.” “This is an area where there are no rules to the game,” McCaul added. “It raises all sorts of issues for Americans.” McCaul said that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has also started using the Internet to damage American interests. The extremist group, he said, had made major gains by using social media to inspire attacks both here and abroad. “You talk about the new wave of terrorism, this is pretty much it,” McCaul said. “This is a hard thing to stop.” McCaul additionally said that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) further complicated the issue of national security. The TSA announced last Monday that screeners had failed an internal test to find fake explosives and weapons at most of America’s busiest airports. “It was an abysmal performance,” McCaul said on Sunday. “In the high threat environment that we’re in right now, this is totally unacceptable.” ||||| Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) says if an upcoming ruling by the Supreme Court results in the legalization of same-sex marriage, opponents should consider pursuing a constitutional amendment banning it. “If the court decides that, the only next approach is for those who are supporters of marriage being defined as between one man and one woman is ultimately to consider pursuing a constitutional amendment,” he said in an interview airing Sunday on ABC News’s “This Week.” ADVERTISEMENT Walker, who said he believes marriage is between one man and one woman, added that the decision should be “left up to the states.” The Wisconsin governor said during the interview he plans to announce his 2016 intentions “shortly” after the end of June. The high court is expected to issue its decision on same-sex marriage before its current term ends at the end of the month. |||||Summary:","completion":"House Homeland Security Chairman, Michael McCaul, has stated in an interview on CBS's \\"Face the Nation\\" that evidence suggests that China is responsible for a federal data breach earlier this year, which saw hackers expose the private data of 4 million current and former federal employees.

The front of the Air China Boeing 757 had been pushed in and scratches and scraped paintwork were clearly visible when it landed. The plane was climbing over China when a large bang was heard from the front of aircraft. Pictures of the Air China jet show the damage the mysterious mid-air collision caused to its nose cone after. The pilot said the aircraft was struggling to perform and he immediately called air traffic controllers, according to reports. He was then allowed him to return to the airport. Experts said investigations into the suspected crash have raised suspicions that the aircraft was hit by a 'foreign object'. However, they do not believe it was caused by a bird strike as no blood or feathers were visible on the dented nose cone. The damage was only spotted when the plane, which was travelling from Chengdu to Guangzhou, safely landed. The dented nose cone has caused speculation online that the aircraft hit a UFO as it flew over China. The pictures have prompted online speculation that it was caused by a UFO or a drone strike. Other theories posted on the Aviation Herald include pressure from rapidly heated and expanded air. Former government UFO investigator Nick Pope told The Sun that an examination of the nose cone should reveal what hit it. He said traces of whatever collided with the aircraft should be visible. However, he questioned whether the 'secretive' Chinese would reveal the cause. Mr Pope told The Sun: 'Cases like this show that whatever people believe about UFOs, there are serious air safety issues here. 'MoD and CAA files contain dozens of reports of near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft. 'It's only a matter of time before there's a catastrophe.' The Air China Boeing 757 (similar to the one pictured) was forced to make an emergency landing. No one was hurt in the mysterious incident. Last week, it emerged that three passenger jet pilots saw UFOs. above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their approach to Gatwick. Airport. A report revealed that they each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft. Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared. The encounter, which was probed by the UK Airprox Board, happened on December 30 just before 9am over the Scientology headquarters in East Grinstead, Sussex.","completion":"1.

Does the sentence \\"The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire.\\" answer the question \\"How much Scottish capital was lost in the Panama colony attempt?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire.\\" answers the question \\"How much Scottish capital was lost in the Panama colony attempt?\\" by specifying that a quarter (25%) of Scottish capital was lost during the failed endeavor. To further elaborate on the context and details of the Darien scheme, it is essential to understand its historical background and implications. The Darien scheme was an ambitious and ill-fated attempt by the Kingdom of Scotland to establish a trading colony called \\"Caledonia\\" in the Isthmus of Panama during the late 17th century, specifically between 1698 and 1700. Scotland, at the time, was an independent country seeking to expand its sphere of influence and secure its future by establishing overseas colonies and strengthening its trade potential. The mastermind behind this project was William Paterson, a Scottish trader who had previously played a significant role in founding the Bank of England. The idea was to create a flourishing trade hub in the Americas that would encourage trade between Europe and the East Indies, while also securing a significant profit for the Scottish investors. In order to fund this ambitious project, the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies was established, raising roughly £400,000 (around 25% of the total available capital in Scotland) to finance the plan. However, from its conception, the Darien scheme faced various challenges that eventually led to its collapse. Some of the challenges included the lack of support from the English government and powerful merchants due to political rivalry, the unwillingness of other European nations to trade with the Scottish colony due to their existing economic allegiance with Spain, and the harsh conditions in the Isthmus of Panama, which included inhospitable terrain, tropical diseases, severe food shortages, and conflict with the local Spanish forces. As a result, the Scottish attempt to establish a colony in Panama failed catastrophically, leading to a massive financial disaster for Scotland, with a quarter of its total capital lost alongside the lives of around 2,000 colonists. The fallout from this failure also marked the end of any Scottish ambitions of setting up its own overseas empire. The disastrous consequences of the Darien scheme eventually fueled Scotland's financial vulnerability and is considered one of the key factors that enabled the negotiations and ratification of the Acts of Union in 1707, which resulted in the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain through the merging of the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Joan Ganz Cooney (born Joan Ganz; November 30, 1929) is an American television producer. She is one of the founders of the Sesame Workshop (originally \\"Children's Television Workshop\\" or CTW), the organization famous for the creation of the children's television show \\"Sesame Street\\", which was also co-created by her. Cooney grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and earned a B.A. degree in education from the University of Arizona in 1951. After working for the State Department in Washington, D.C. and as a journalist in Phoenix, she worked as a publicist for television and production companies in New York City. In 1961, she became interested in working for educational television, and became a documentary producer for New York's first educational TV station WNET (Channel 13). Many of the programs she produced won local Emmys. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Sesame Street Fever is a concept album made by the cast of Sesame Street in 1978 . It follows the characters as a love of disco sweeps Sesame Street . The album heavily parodies Saturday Night Fever , and the cover features Grover where John Travolta should be , and Ernie , Bert , and Cookie Monster in the place of the Bee Gees . Bee Gee Robin Gibb also appears on the album , and according to the LP 's liner notes , \`\` appears courtesy of his children - Melissa and Spencer Gibb '' .

This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Sesame Street is a long-running American children's television series, produced by Sesame Workshop (formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop) and created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett. The program is known for its educational content, and images communicated through the use of Jim Henson's Muppets, animation, short films, humor, and cultural references. The series premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, and high viewership; it has aired on the U.S.'s national public television provider (PBS) since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016. - Sesame Workshop (SW, or \\"the Workshop\\"), formerly known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), is an American non-profit organization behind the production of several educational children's programsincluding its first and best-known, \\"Sesame Street\\"that have run on public broadcasting around the world. Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett came up with the idea to form an organization to oversee the production of \\"Sesame Street\\", a television show which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was called \\"one of the most important television developments of the decade\\". - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Lloyd Newton Morrisett Jr (born November 2, 1929) is an American experimental psychologist with a career in education, communications, and philanthropy.

Renowned author Uroob's masterpiece novel Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum is set in the backdrops of Malabar Rebellion. The novel has about thirty characters belonging to three generations of eight families belonging to Malabar during the end of the Second World War. Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award, India's most prestigious literary award, in 1960. It also received the Asan Centenary Award in 1973, a special award given by the Kerala Sahitya Akademi for the most outstanding work since Independence. The 1988 Malayalam language film 1921 or Ayirathi Thollayirathi Irupathonnu , directed by I. V. Sasi and written by T. Damodaran, depicts the events of the rebellion. The film stars Mammootty as Khadir, a retired Mappila soldier, alongside Madhu as Ali Musliyar. The film won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value in the same year. The rebellion also spawned a large number of Mappila Songs. Many of these describe the events surrounding the Khilafat movement in Malabar and offer a view of conditions in the area at the time. Ahmed Kutty composed the Malabar Lahala enna Khilafat Patt in 1925, which describes the events of the rebellion. Many of rebel prisoners such as Tannirkode Ossankoya composed songs in their letters to relatives. The rebellion triggered the development of Mygurudu, a Malayalam-based secret language. Prisoners used this coded language to pass messages without getting leaked out to the authorities.In later times, this language was also used by employees of Beedi manufacturing units of North Kerala among others.

With a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, this app deserves praise for its high-quality content and user-friendly interface, however, there's some room for improvement. One of the standout features of this app is the sheer variety of news categories. It provides updates on everything from local events to global news, politics, business, science, technology, and even arts and culture. The app is also frequently updated, ensuring that users receive the most recent and relevant information. Audio content is another strong aspect of the NPR News App. As a public radio network, NPR boasts one of the best collections of podcasts and radio shows in various fields, which can all be easily accessed through the app. The audio quality is crisp and clear, and the app allows for easy streaming or downloading of content for offline listening. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent me from giving the NPR News App a perfect rating. First, while the overall design of the app is clean and easy to navigate, the fonts are quite small, which may make it difficult for users with visual impairments to read comfortably. While it doesn't impact my experience personally, I think it's important to consider accessibility for all users. Secondly, I occasionally encounter a bug where articles take significantly longer to load or may not load at all. This issue usually resolves itself after restarting the app, but it can be frustrating when trying to stay up-to-date on breaking news. Despite these small hurdles, the NPR News App remains a reliable source for comprehensive news coverage and high-quality audio content. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an accessible and engaging way to stay informed on both local and global events. With some slight improvements, the app has the potential to become even better and earn a 5-star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people who calculated the critical mass of uranium? ? At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

Background: The Wildhearts are an English rock group, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \\"29 X The Pain\\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression. Context: The Wildhearts formed in late 1989, after Ginger was sacked from the Quireboys. An often-told story from this time period is that Ginger decided to start his own band after falling down a flight of stairs with a bottle of Jack Daniel's but emerging with the bottle intact. Had the bottle smashed, he would have slit his wrists with the shards, but instead he resolved to form a band in which he could exercise his songwriting skills, rather than just playing guitar as in his previous bands. Throughout the band's career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself. Initially called the Wild Hearts (two words), the band originally included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F. Mullett (ex-Mournblade), who both joined for short periods. Nine demos were recorded in 1989 and 1990 with Snake singing on four and Dunken on five. These demos remain unreleased and displayed a sound resembling Guns N' Roses, with the Wildhearts sound still to be developed. Some of the demos were produced by Ric Browde and intended for an EP release that never materialized, though these demos are occasionally found on unofficial releases. In March 1991, Ginger reluctantly took over on lead vocals despite his reservations, as he has never thought himself a good singer. After many early personnel changes, the line-up solidified around Ginger on guitar and vocals, CJ (Christopher Jagdhar) on guitar and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Dogs D'Amour drummer Bam. This line-up released two EPs in 1992, Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go and Don't Be Happy...Just Worry. Question: What record label did they first sign with? Answer:","completion":"To find out what record label the Wildhearts first signed with, we need to look into the releases mentioned in the context provided. The two EPs released in 1992, \\"Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go\\" and \\"Don't Be Happy...Just Worry,\\" can serve as the starting point for this investigation. Step 1: Identify the record label for the EP \\"Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go.\\" After researching, it is found that \\"Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go\\" was released by EastWest Records, a division of Warner Music Group. Step 2: Identify the record label for the EP \\"Don't Be Happy...Just Worry.\\" Upon further research, we find that \\"Don't Be Happy...Just Worry\\" was also released by EastWest Records. Since both of their early EPs were released by EastWest Records in 1992 and there is no mention of any previous releases or record deals, we can safely conclude that the Wildhearts first signed with EastWest Records."},{"prompt":"Q: Fact 1: Pressure receptors are found mainly in the skin.

This indicates dissatisfaction and criticism. Step 3: Assess the Overall Impression Given While the reviewer found the content good, the negative aspects they've pointed out far outweigh this single positive statement. The issues with the video quality left a bigger impression on the reviewer, and they felt the need to mention these aspects specifically and compare to a presumably better-quality source. Step 4: Final Conclusion Based on the steps above - the understanding, the tone and choice of words used, and the overall impression - the product review can be classified as negative. Even though there's some appreciation present, the criticism of the technical aspects of the video paints an overall negative picture of the user's experience with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In order to wrestle better you lift weights to? Options: - have strength - strong - take lessons - fo brushing - get naked Explain why a human would choose \\"have strength\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"have strength\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Relevance: Out of the options provided, \\"have strength\\" is the most directly relevant to the context of wrestling and lifting weights. Lifting weights typically results in increased muscular strength, which is essential for improving one's wrestling performance. 2. Clarity: \\"have strength\\" is a clear and straightforward expression that correlates the act of lifting weights with the intended outcome - improving strength. 3. Applicability: The option \\"have strength\\" is the most applicable to all individuals who might be engaging in wrestling. The other options might not universally apply to every person trying to improve their wrestling skills. For example, \\"strong\\" is an adjective, not an outcome; \\"take lessons\\" might not directly contribute to wrestling better without adding strength through weightlifting; \\"fo brushing\\" is unclear and seems unrelated, and \\"get naked\\" is completely unrelated and inappropriate for this context. 4. Goal-oriented: \\"have strength\\" is the most goal-oriented choice, as it directly addresses the purpose behind lifting weights. It implies that the individual aims to enhance their physical strength and, hence, wrestle better. In summary, a human would choose \\"have strength\\" as it is the most relevant, clear, applicable, and goal-oriented option among the given choices to explain why someone would lift weights when trying to improve their wrestling skills."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich? Options: - Kim - Trump - Moon - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"Kim. In the given information, it was mentioned that President Trump tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken Kim's government, but would bolster it.

The mid-1970s saw the introduction of dbx-encoded records, again for the audiophile niche market. These were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range (dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in dB: quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via automatic gain control in the playback equipment; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages).

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

He also referenced certain articles, which CNN could not confirm, and requested a phone call to discuss the matter further. The motivation behind these emails appears to be Weinstein's desire to draw attention to his side of the story in the New York City rape case.

Meanwhile, Vandal Savage plots to exterminate the greater part of the human population and start a new civilization; he discreetly gave the technology to the Gang for testing purposes. To ensure the Justice League cannot stop him, Savage hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman to incapacitate his League teammates, in case they go rogue. Savage assembles Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, who all have personal vendettas against the heroes and pays them to simultaneously attack using the stolen plans, albeit altered to be lethal. When the supervillains agree, he welcomes them to the Legion of Doom. The villains each do their part to take out each member of the Justice League: Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is informed by Alfred Pennyworth that the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been exhumed and are missing. At his parents' graves, Bruce is ambushed by Bane, who gains the upper hand and renders Bruce unconscious. Bruce is buried alive in his father's coffin; he is left a tape recorder with a message from Bane taunting him, which motivates him to break out of the coffin. He realizes that the League has been attacked using his contingency plans, which were constructed from studying physical and psychological weaknesses in the event the League went to the other side or succumbed to mind control.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

This is accompanied by a blunt bass line and frenetic drumming. The song's dirty sound was produced using an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff distortion pedal, which is augmented by a second guitar providing more distortion. Music writer Brian J. Barr referred to this noisy sound as \\"the sonic equivalent of an amplified comb scraping against paper\\".Critics have noted a Stooges influence in \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: \\"In retrospect, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' by way of The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. At the time I was trying for the stuttering R&B guitar of The Nights and Days.\\" The song is also reminiscent of the hardcore punk of Black Flag.

It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland. - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games. - Jamie Alan Staff MBE ( born 30 April 1973 ) is an English racing cyclist and coach , formerly on BMX and later on the track . A World and Olympic champion , he has also won numerous other medals at World Championships , World Cups and at the Commonwealth Games . - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then. - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom. - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.

Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, Lopez, and Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions. Question: \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\" Answer: \\"Nuremberg, 1471\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as hiking and cooking. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions. Further, they can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from harmful UV radiation. There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice. The body louse specifically lives in clothing, and diverge from head lice about 107,000 years ago, suggesting that clothing existed at that time. Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of primates who may have worn clothes and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago. Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,000–72,000 BP. Answer this series of questions: 1. what does clothing do? 2. from what? 3. what does it protect from? 4. what else? 5. how does it protect from those things? 6. do other mammals today wear them? 7. how long have people had clothes? 8. how do we know that? 9. how do we know they've been around for many years? 10. can wearing it us safe from the sun? Numbered answers:","completion":"1. Clothing serves multiple purposes, including protection from the elements, safety during various activities, insulation against temperature extremes, and acting as a hygienic barrier against infectious or toxic materials. Additionally, clothing provides protection from harmful UV radiation. 2. Clothes are primarily made from various materials like fabric, textiles, and synthetic materials, depending on the purpose and desired protection or coverage. 3. Clothing protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns, and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. 4. Besides physical protection, clothes also offer insulation from extreme cold or hot conditions, keeping the body warm or cool as needed. It also acts as a hygienic barrier against infectious or toxic materials, reducing the risk of contamination. 5. Clothing protects the wearer by creating a physical barrier that keeps harmful elements from coming into direct contact with the skin. The insulation properties of various materials help regulate temperature and reduce exposure to harsh environments. 6. Other mammals typically do not wear clothes, as their natural fur or skin adaptations are enough to protect them from their environment. However, it is not uncommon for people to dress their pets in clothing for added protection or warmth in specific situations, or for purely aesthetic reasons. 7. The exact timeline is uncertain, but clothing has likely been used by humans for over 100,000 years. Some theories even suggest clothing could have been used as far back as 650,000 years ago. 8. The evidence for the development of clothing comes from indirect sources, such as the study of lice. Body lice, which specifically live in clothing, diverged from head lice about 107,000 years ago, suggesting that clothing existed around that time. 9. The study of lice is used to estimate the introduction of clothing because the presence of body lice, which live in clothing, indicates the existence of clothing at the time. Other louse-based estimates put the introduction of clothing between 42,000 and 72,000 years ago. 10. Yes, clothing can provide protection from the sun by blocking harmful UV radiation and reducing the risk of issues like sunburn and skin cancer.

As a 9/11 widow, I understood my role on the memorial jury to have both a personal and a public component. At no time was the confluence of those roles more clear to me than when we discussed the placement of victims' names on the memorial. And nothing had a more profound effect on my feelings of closure than the decision to use the concept of \\"meaningful adjacencies\\" to determine the placement of those names. When I first heard the phrase \\"meaningful adjacencies,\\" I had no idea how powerful the concept would prove to be. At the time, in 2004, those of us who had the honor of serving on the jury that selected the winning design for the 9/11 Memorial had been struggling hard with how best to display the names. It was clear that arranging the names alphabetically or by company would be too cold and dispassionate, as if this were a listing you'd see in a building directory posted near the elevator. The alternative, displaying the names randomly, seemed at first to make more sense. After all, it was random, wasn't it, who lived and who died on that terrible morning 10 years ago? But ultimately, we realized, a random arrangement felt wrong, too. The deaths of our loved ones may have been random, but their lives were not. In the concept of meaningful adjacencies, we had at last found a powerful response to the senselessness of our loved ones' deaths. Placing names in thoughtful proximity to one another would give us the opportunity to bear witness to the shared care and concern, the labor and joy that bound these people together while they were alive -- whether as siblings or colleagues, as friends or family, or even as former strangers who turned to one another for comfort at that moment of cataclysm. In a profound way, we realized that meaningful adjacencies would convey both the disturbing appearance of randomness with a comforting underlying truth: We are all connected. The idea captured us all. Michael Arad, the designer of the memorial, came up with this simple yet powerful concept. I will always remember how he explained it to the jury: A memorial is a monument unless it lists the names of those lost. It was crucial that the names on this memorial be displayed, and displayed with purpose. And so although it would be a Herculean task to get the needed input from family members, we all felt strongly that the effort to evoke this underlying network of connections would elegantly and simply convey not only the way in which these precious lives were lost but, perhaps more importantly, how these precious lives were lived. It would be upon us, the family members, to decide who to list our loved ones near, and it would come from knowledge that only we could supply. When the 9/11 Memorial sent personalized letters to victims' next of kin across the globe, there were more than 1,200 meaningful adjacency requests. All of them were honored. Powerfully calling to mind the image of an invisible web linking those who perished, the reasons for some adjacencies will be fairly obvious to the general public. The Hanson family — Sue, Peter, and their 2-year-old daughter Christine, the youngest victim on September 11 — died together on Flight 175 and will be listed together. Their names might have been adjacent even in an alphabetical listing. But then there is a family that died on Flight 77 — Charles Falkenberg and Leslie Whittington, married for 17 years, and their children Zoe and Dana — whose names would have been separated by a simple alphabetical order. And then there are adjacencies that express connections that are more hidden, and yet profound. Abigail Ross Goodman lost both her father, Richard Ross, on Flight 11, which crashed into the North Tower, and her best friend, Stacey Leigh Sanders, who was working that morning in the North Tower on the 96th floor. For Abigail Ross Goodman, the names of these two loved ones will forever be linked in her memory and now also at the memorial. It's important to note that the memorial also launched a Memorial Guide, a digital tool to help family members and visitors locate any name. Not only does the guide show the exact place where a person's name will be, but it also provides background information on all of the victims and lists any adjacencies. People will be able to locate a name in advance via the 9/11 Memorial's website or use an on-site kiosk to find a loved one or learn more about any of the victims. In the case of my husband, David Berry, I requested that he and his trusted colleague and friend, Thomas Theurkauf, be listed near each other. Although we will never know for certain, Tom's widow and I are convinced that our husbands died together. There is no more powerful testament to the special bonds that could not be broken by the murderous attacks of that day. We are comforted to know that their names will be kept close, reflecting how they stood together on the morning of September 11. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paula Grant Berry. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

That would still mean an annual pay rise of up to £600 for full-time staff. The National Living Wage, which was introduced in April, currently stands at £7.20 per hour for workers aged 25 and over. About 4.5 million workers are expected to benefit from the increase - with the amount dependent on how many hours they work. Stephen Clarke, policy analyst at Resolution Foundation told the BBC's Today programme: \\"The National Living Wage relates to average earnings and because of Brexit, many forecasters, including the Bank of England, revised down their earnings growth; therefore the National Living Wage has also been revised down.\\" The Resolution Foundation now forecasts the rate - which is linked to the growth in pay of typical workers - to reach £8.60 by 2020, based on current forecasts. Further details are expected as part of the Autumn Statement on 23 November. Despite the fact that the increase is lower than expected, the report adds that the National Living Wage is still set to transform the country's low-pay, helping some 800,000 workers out of low pay by 2020. Low-pay is defined as an employee earning two-thirds of the country's typical hourly pay. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \\"The government is committed to building an economy that works for all and the national living wage is doing just that, with more than one million workers already benefiting from a pay rise. \\"The independent Low Pay Commission is chiefly responsible for making recommendations for national minimum wage rates.\\" Research from insolvency firm Begbies Traynor has indicated that nearly 100,000 businesses are said to be experiencing \\"financial distress\\" since the higher wage came in.

Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor said: \\"My concern is that many of these struggling businesses may now be forced to take more drastic measures to manage their growing cost base, such as further cuts to staff numbers, reducing bonuses or even passing on the increased costs to the end consumer.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"This article talks about the National Living Wage in the UK.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Adell helped off the horse? ? In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.

Product review: I agree with many fellow reviewers that say that this is one of EC's better releases in a while, but let's not confuse this with real blues. This CD lacks soul and depth. It is worth casual listening, but after the fourth or fifth playing it feels stale and mediocre. After listening to John Lee Hooker, Son House & Elmore James continuously for the past month, you'll find this recording as bland as I did. I just didn't feel the music. If Buddy Guy is your flavor, this might work. Otherwise, stay away and spend your money on any John Lee Hooker. You'll be glad you did. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product. The reviewer suggests that the album lacks soul and depth, and feels stale and mediocre after a few listens. They also compare it unfavorably to the works of John Lee Hooker, Son House, and Elmore James, and they recommend buying John Lee Hooker albums instead. However, they do mention that if you like Buddy Guy's style, this album might work for you.

Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II?, what is it ?

OPT: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","completion":"In this case, the statement provided is \\"His eyes filled with joyous expectation, a skier prepares for a jump.\\" The question asks whether we can conclude that \\"A skier is about to ski\\" based on this statement. Based on the information given in the statement, the options we have to answer this question are: (a) yes (b) it is not possible to tell (c) no Let's analyze the statement and discuss each option in detail. (a) Yes: The statement mentions that a skier is preparing to jump. This implies that he is likely at the top of a slope or a ramp, getting ready to perform a skiing jump. Since skiing is the fundamental action involved in the jump, we might reasonably conclude that the skier is about to ski to make the jump. The skier's eyes being filled with joyous expectation emphasizes that they're eager and ready to start skiing and perform the jump. It seems to support the idea that the skier is about to ski. (b) It is not possible to tell: Some might argue that although the statement implies the skier is preparing for a jump, we don't have enough information to determine whether he will actually ski. For example, there could be factors that prevent the skier from starting, such as changes in weather conditions, technical problems, or health issues. However, it is important to note that the question asks whether we can conclude that the skier is \\"about to ski\\" and not whether they will successfully perform the jump. With the information we have, we know that the skier is preparing for the jump, and therefore, it seems reasonable to infer that the skier is about to ski. (c) No: This option suggests that we cannot conclude that the skier is about to ski based on the information provided. However, this conclusion does not seem to align with the context of the statement where the skier, filled with joyous expectation, is preparing for a jump. As mentioned earlier, since skiing is a necessary action for performing the jump, it is logical to assume that the skier is about to ski. To summarize, given the statement \\"His eyes filled with joyous expectation, a skier prepares for a jump,\\" it is reasonable to conclude that \\"A skier is about to ski.\\" Although we cannot predict every future event or circumstance accurately, the context of the statement suggests that the skier is indeed preparing to take part in skiing to perform the jump.

Paragraph: After the disruption of the plot in Amman, it had not escaped notice in Washington that Hijazi had lived in California and driven a cab in Boston and that Deek was a naturalized U.S. citizen who, as Berger reminded President Clinton, had been in touch with extremists in the United States as well as abroad. Before Ressam's arrest, Berger saw no need to raise a public alarm at home- although the FBI put all field offices on alert. Now, following Ressam's arrest, the FBI asked for an unprecedented number of special wiretaps. Both Berger andTenet told us that their impression was that more Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretap requests were processed during the millennium alert than ever before. The next day, writing about Ressam's arrest and links to a cell in Montreal, Berger informed the President that the FBI would advise police in the United States to step up activities but would still try to avoid undue public alarm by stressing that the government had no specific information about planned attacks. At a December 22 meeting of the Small Group of principals, FBI Director Louis Freeh briefed officials from the NSC staff, CIA, and Justice on wiretaps and investigations inside the United States, including a Brooklyn entity tied to the Ressam arrest, a seemingly unreliable foreign report of possible attacks on seven U.S. cities, two Algerians detained on the Canadian border, and searches in Montreal related to a jihadist cell. The Justice Department released a statement on the alert the same day. Clarke's staff warned, \\"Foreign terrorist sleeper cells are present in the US and attacks in the US are likely.\\" Clarke asked Berger to try to make sure that the domestic agencies remained alert.\\" Is there a threat to civilian aircraft?\\"he wrote. Clarke also asked the principals in late December to discuss a foreign security service report about a Bin Laden plan to put bombs on transatlantic flights. The CSG met daily. Berger said that the principals met constantly. Later, when asked what made her decide to ask Ressam to step out of his vehicle, Diana Dean, a Customs inspector who referred Ressam to secondary inspection, testified that it was her \\"training and experience.\\" It appears that the heightened sense of alert at the national level played no role in Ressam's detention. There was a mounting sense of public alarm. The earlier Jordanian arrests had been covered in the press, and Ressam's arrest was featured on network evening news broadcasts throughout the Christmas season.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: Why did they destroy the damn? restoring the water A:","completion":"Title: Unchained Waters Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama Plot: In the small, once-prosperous town of Riverton, nestled in a lush valley, a colossal dam stands as the primary source of water and livelihood for the people. Constructed by the powerful Weston Company decades ago, the dam monopolized the local water supply and served as the heart of a hydroelectric plant, driving economic success in the town. The citizens of Riverton have long depended on the dam but have become increasingly concerned with the company's intentions as they see their once lush and thriving valley now dry and merely surviving. Our protagonist, Jack Hartley, is a hydrologist returning to his hometown after years of study and research around the world, hoping to find a solution to the town's water crisis. Upon returning, Jack discovers that the Weston Company has enforced strict water restrictions throughout the town, causing suffering and strife among the people. As he digs deeper into the situation, he uncovers a secret buried deep within the company's ancient archives: a blueprint for the expansion of the plant that would generate more power and profit for the company but would lead to the destruction of the eco-system and slowly exhaust the water resources in the valley. Jack begins a search for allies to help him put an end to the company's exploitation of the region's natural resources. He reconnects with his childhood friend, Sarah Walker, an environmental activist who has been battling the Weston Company for years. Jack and Sarah rally like-minded individuals, including local fishermen, farmers, and a group of engineers who provide them vital information about the dam's structure, weaknesses and eventual consequences. As the group gets closer to the truth, they discover that the construction of the dam nearly a century ago caused the disappearance of a long-lost ancient waterfall, flooding an old part of the town that held the tombs of the region's ancestral people. The Riverton ancestors were known for their devotion to the river and its natural resources; if the town could revive the waterfall and reveal the tombs, they could appeal to the national heritage department for protection against the Weston Company's actions. Now the team faces a race against time: they must destroy the dam and restore the water flow to the valley before the company initiates its expansion plan. A skilled team of engineers – once part of the Weston Company but disillusioned by their former employer's greed – help Jack and Sarah devise an ingenious plan to first divert the water from the dam and then use explosives strategically to bring the colossal structure down safely. As the day of the planned destruction arrives, the Weston Company catches wind of their plot, and a fierce battle ensues as Jack and Sarah's team valiantly attempts to reclaim the town's future. With the help of their friends, our protagonists overcome the company's mercenaries, and Jack succeeds in initiating the dam destruction sequence. As the dam collapses, the freed waters flow into the valley, reviving the ancient waterfall and exposing the lost tombs. The people of Riverton rejoice as they watch the river come back to life, symbolizing the beginning of a new era for their community. The national heritage department declares the region protected, forcing the Weston Company to abandon their expansion plans. In an unexpected twist, Jack learns that his father, who passed away when he was young, was once an engineer for the Weston Company. He was instrumental in uncovering the truth about the lost waterfall and had secretly documented the environmental impact of the dam. Following his father's legacy, Jack establishes a new water management system and works alongside Sarah to preserve and nourish their hometown's rich environment. Unchained Waters becomes a symbol of the community's resilience and determination to reforging the connection with its ancestral ties and its reverence for the river that sustains it."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has once again threatened to crush the militants.

Identify the entity: The entity is Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is mentioned in the sentence as \\"President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\\" 2. Analyze the sentence for sentiment indicators: The sentence states that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi \\"has once again threatened to crush the militants.\\" This statement does not praise or criticize his quality or skills directly, nor does it express a fact or quote from someone else. 3. Analyze the context and possible implications: In this context, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is taking a firm stance against militants, which might be considered as a display of strength or leadership. This could be seen as positive by those who support his actions, but the sentence itself does not convey any explicit sentiment. Based on the analysis, the sentiment of the document towards the entity Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is Neutral since the sentence provides information on his actions but does not express any clear positive or negative view towards him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"1-hour ozone standard is still considered new, and some areas have problems with keeping up with it.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the statement \\"1-hour ozone standard is still considered new, and some areas have problems with keeping up with it.\\" follows from the information provided, let us break down the task into smaller steps. Step 1: Examine the original statement. The original statement mentions that more than 97 million people live in areas that do not yet meet the health-based 1-hour ozone standard, based on data from 1997-1999. Step 2: Analyze the information. From the statement, we know that there are areas not meeting the 1-hour ozone standard, but we do not have information regarding the ozone standard's age or if it was considered new during the time the data was collected (1997-1999). Step 3: Consider the current relevance. The data mentioned is from 1997-1999, which is over two decades old. As such, even if the standard was considered new at that time, it would not necessarily be considered new now. Step 4: Determine if the statement follows. Given the lack of information on the ozone standard's age and the outdated data, it is not possible to conclude that \\"1-hour ozone standard is still considered new, and some areas have problems with keeping up with it.\\" In conclusion, the statement does not follow from the information provided due to the lack of data on the ozone standard's age and the outdated nature of the data (1997-1999)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: How would Carson feel as a result? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: wished he didn't miss the family vacation B: ready for the trip C: was very happy he and the fmaily could leave for vacation Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that Carson would have experienced a range of emotions in response to the situation. However, in order to determine which of the given options best answers the question, a deeper analysis of the context is required. When considering the situation, it's important to remember that Alex made Carson's inspection for them, allowing Carson to go on vacation. This act demonstrates a form of kindness, thoughtfulness, or even selflessness on Alex's part, as they went out of their way to ensure that Carson could join the trip without any issues. Given this context, here's an evaluation of each of the potential answers: A: Wished he didn't miss the family vacation - This response seems to assume that Carson did miss the family vacation, which contradicts the context given. Since Alex made the inspection for Carson, they were able to go on vacation without any problem. Therefore, Carson would not be wishing that they hadn't missed the vacation. This option does not seem to be the best answer to the question. B: Ready for the trip - While it is true that Carson may feel ready for the trip as a result of Alex's efforts, this answer does not fully capture the emotional response Carson might have towards Alex or the situation. The focus of this question is on how Carson feels about the fact that Alex made the inspection for them so they could join the vacation, rather than simply their readiness for the trip itself. Although this option isn't completely incorrect, it doesn't seem to provide the most accurate answer based on the context. C: Was very happy he and the family could leave for vacation - This option seems to be the most fitting choice, considering the context provided. By stating that Carson is very happy that he and the family could leave for vacation, it suggests that Carson appreciates Alex's gesture and the impacts it has had on their ability to go on this trip. It conveys a sense of gratitude and joy, which seems to be the most appropriate emotional response considering the circumstances. Taking the context into account, it can be concluded that the answer which best describes Carson's feelings as a result of Alex's actions is option C: \\"Was very happy he and the family could leave for vacation.\\" This response not only captures Carson's positive feelings towards the situation, but also highlights the fact that it was Alex's efforts that enabled them to go on vacation with the rest of the family."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

There are serious papers for those who want to know about important happenings everywhere, both at home and abroad. There are popular newspapers for those who prefer entertainment to information. The London newspaper that is best known outside Great Britain is probably the Times. It began in 1785, and is well accepted for believable news and serious opinions on the news. It calls itself an independent paper, which means that it does not give its support to a particular political party.

A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500 kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, electric elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting.[citation needed] Question: What circumstances can a fright elevator transport passengers?

Please answer this question: What was the first general-purpose electronic computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems which, though designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, was first used in calculations for the hydrogen bomb?","completion":"The first general-purpose electronic computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC). Designed and built during World War II by John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, ENIAC was initially commissioned to calculate artillery firing tables for the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. However, its first application turned out to be performing calculations for the hydrogen bomb. ENIAC was a groundbreaking invention in the field of computing, as it was the first electronic machine that could be programmed to execute a wide range of tasks at rapid speed. Before ENIAC, computers were mostly mechanical, and specific computing problems required alterations or modifications in the physical setup of the machines. ENIAC, on the other hand, could be reprogrammed using a series of switches and cables to handle diverse calculations. The concept of ENIAC took shape during the height of the Second World War in 1943, with construction beginning in the same year. The machine's development was carried out at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. ENIAC was a classified project, and its progress was kept secret. Although the original intention was to aid the Army's artillery calculations, the machine's completion in 1945 coincided with the end of the war, causing its purpose to shift. ENIAC was first used for computational analysis in the development of the hydrogen bomb, under the classified project named 'Monte Carlo Simulations'. This effort was led by John von Neumann, who was among the world-renowned scientists and mathematicians working on the Manhattan Project. Drafted into the project in 1944, von Neumann's involvement drastically changed the course of the ENIAC's application, marking the beginning of its use in nuclear bomb calculations. When ENIAC was unveiled to the public on February 14, 1946, it was hailed as a major milestone in computing technology. Measuring over 100 feet in length, 10 feet in height, and weighing an astonishing 30 tons, ENIAC contained approximately 17,000 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 1,500 relays, and 70,000 resistors. It could perform addition operations in 200 microseconds and multiplication operations in 2,800 microseconds. ENIAC's contributions to modern computing are numerous, particularly as it served as a prototype for future electronic computers. Following ENIAC, several other electronic machines such as EDVAC, UNIVAC I, and IBM 701 were developed, marking the dawn of the computer age. While ENIAC's original purpose was to assist in artillery calculations, its role in the development of the hydrogen bomb and the facilitation of advanced computation marked a historical turning point in both military and computer science fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick your answer from: - description. - entity. - abbreviation. - human. - numeric. - location.Would the answer to the question \\"How do fuel injectors work ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"How do fuel injectors work?\\" would be a description. Fuel injectors are a key component of a vehicle's fuel system, vital for maintaining optimal engine performance. Their function is to deliver fuel to the engine's cylinders in the precise quantity and at the correct timing for combustion. The answer to the query \\"How do fuel injectors work?\\" would thus involve a descriptive explanation of the operational mechanics of fuel injectors. Firstly, the fuel pump sends fuel from the tank to the fuel injectors under pressure. The pressure assists in atomizing the fuel, i.e., transforming it into tiny droplets to facilitate better mixing with air. The fuel injection system is tied to the electronic control module (ECM), a kind of car's computer that controls multiple operations in the engine. When the vehicle is turned on, the engine control unit (ECU) starts sending signals to the injectors. These signals contain information about how much fuel should be released and when it should be administered. As electricity from the ECU flows into the injector, it opens a spring-loaded valve through a solenoid lifting process. Under high pressure, the fuel is sprayed out of the injector's nozzle and enters the engine's combustion chamber. The droplets of fuel mix with the air in the combustion chamber, ignited by the spark plug's power, leading to the creation of power that propels the vehicle. When the ECU stops sending the signal, the valve in the injector closes, halting the supply of fuel. Hence, the fuel injector manages to provide the exact quantity of fuel as needed by the engine, optimizing performance while reducing waste, emissions, and increasing fuel efficiency. Essentially, the answer would be a detailed description of this process and might also include information about different types of fuel injectors, their specific mechanics, and potential issues and solutions related to them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1127, the djinn (Andrew Divoff) asks a Persian emperor to make his second wish. When the emperor wishes to see wonders, the djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. The emperor is horrified, but the djinn tells him to use his third wish to set things right. Before the emperor can make his third wish, Zoroaster (Ari Barak), a sorcerer, explains the consequences of the third wish and reveals a fire opal, which pulls the djinn inside and traps him.

A dog could be a baby's best friend, according to a study in the medical journal Pediatrics. Infants living in households with dogs were healthier and had fewer ear infections than those without a dog, the study found. Researchers also found that cats appeared to offer some protection, but the link wasn't as strong. Babies who lived in households with dogs were healthier and had fewer ear infections than babies without a dog in the home, according to a study in Pediatrics by Finnish researchers. Jennifer Corbett Dooren has details on Lunch Break. (Photo: Getty Images) The study, posted online Monday and based on 397 children who lived in rural and suburban parts of Finland, examined whether contact with dogs and cats during a baby's first year offers any protection from respiratory tract infections, such as colds and resulting common ear infections. \\"The children having dogs at home were healthier, they had less ear infections and they needed less antibiotics,\\" said Eija Bergroth, the study's lead author and a pediatrician affiliated with Kuopio University Hospital in Kuopio, Finland. One measure showed children with dogs were reported as being healthy for about 73% of the time, based on weekly questionnaires, compared with about 65% of children with no dog contact at home. While the study tracked just under 400 babies, the researchers said the results were statistically significant because it relied on weekly questionnaires filled out by parents. Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Infants living in households with dogs were found to be healthier. Dr. Bergroth explained that children who lived in households where dogs spent 18 or more hours a day outside, showed the most healthy days, fewer fevers and the least use of antibiotics compared with babies with no dog at home. One theory is dogs that spend a lot of time outside likely bring more dirt and bacteria inside the home compared with dogs and cats that spend more time indoors, she said. Researchers believe that exposure to dirt and bacteria builds up babies' immune systems. Researchers found that 97% of babies—whose mothers were enrolled in the study during pregnancy—had a runny nose at some point during the study, most had a cough and about 40% had an ear infection. Nearly half of the children needed antibiotics. Earlier studies using smaller samples of children have shown conflicting results on the impact of animal exposure on infections and allergies, though a study funded by the National Institutes of Health showed children exposed to two or more dogs or cats in their first year had lower chances of later developing all kinds of allergies than children exposed to one or no pets. Dr. Bergroth's study involved children who were born at Kuopio University Hospital in Finland between September 2002 and May 2005. The children's parents were given weekly questionnaires from the time their babies were nine weeks old until they were 1 year old. The questionnaires asked if the children had been \\"hale and hearty\\" in the past seven days. If the child wasn't healthy parents were asked to document ailments like fever, cough, runny nose, ear infection, diarrhea, urinary tract infection or rash. Families were also asked each week if they had a dog or a cat at home and how much time the animals spent outside. The study results were tabulated looking at responses on the weekly questionnaires rather than individual children. Researchers analyzed the data in different ways to rule out other factors that could influence infection rates like breastfeeding, low-birth weight, the number of siblings and whether moms smoked during pregnancy. Write to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com ||||| Dogs may protect babies from some infections: study WASHINGTON — Babies who spend time around pet dogs have fewer ear infections and respiratory ailments than those whose homes are animal-free, said a study released on Monday. The study, published in the US journal Pediatrics, did not say why but suggested that being around a dog that spends at least part of its day outdoors may boost a child's immune system in the first year of life. Cats, too, seemed to convey some protection to babies, though the effect observed was weaker than with dogs. The research was based on 397 children in Finland whose parents made diary entries each week recording the state of their child's health during the infant's first year, from nine weeks to 52 weeks of age. Overall, babies in homes with cats or dogs were about 30 percent less likely to have respiratory infectious symptoms -- which included cough, wheezing, rhinitis (stuffy or runny nose) and fever -- and about half as likely to get ear infections. \\"If children had dog or cat contacts at home, they were significantly healthier during the study period,\\" said the study led by experts at Kuopio University Hospital in Finland. The most protective association was seen in children who had a dog inside at home for up to six hours a day, compared to children who did not have any dogs or who had dogs that were always outside. \\"We offer preliminary evidence that dog ownership may be protective against respiratory tract infections during the first year of life,\\" said the study. \\"We speculate that animal contacts could help to mature the immunologic system, leading to more composed immunologic response and shorter duration of infections.\\" The improvement was significant, even after researchers ruled out other factors that could boost infection risk, such as not having been breastfed, attending daycare, being raised by smokers or parents with asthma, or having older siblings in the household. In addition to having less frequent ear infections and respiratory infections, babies near dogs tended to need fewer courses of antibiotics compared to those who were reared in pet-free households, it said. Previous research has shown conflicting results, with some studies finding no benefit for young children being around furry pets and others finding that animal contact appears to offer some protection against colds and stomach ailments. The study authors said their research differs from previous analyses because it focuses solely on the first postnatal year and does not include older children. Copyright © 2012 AFP.

Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - , also known as , was a Japanese domain of the Edo period. It was located in northern Mutsu Province (modern-day Aomori Prefecture), Japan. It was centered on Hirosaki Castle in what is now the city of Hirosaki, Aomori. It was ruled by the Tsugaru clan. A branch of the family ruled the adjoining Kuroishi Domain. - History. Kuroishi Domain began as a 5,000 \\"koku\\" \\"hatamoto\\" holding, created in 1656 for Tsugaru Nobufusa (16201662), the younger son of Tsugaru Nobuhira, 2nd \\"daimy\\" of Hirosaki Domain. Nobuhira had an elder son (Tsugaru Nobuyoshi) by his first wife, the daughter of Ishida Mitsunari, who had been reduced to concubine status when Nobuhira married the niece of Tokugawa Ieyasu to secure his position vis-à-vis the new Tokugawa bakufu following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, his position as the son of a concubine resulted in a split in the ranks of the senior retainers of Tsugaru Domain, with a large faction supporting the younger Tsugaru Nobufusa due to his blood connection to the Tokugawa clan, and due to the fact that he was born as son of Nobuhiras official wife. This resulted in an \\"O-Ie Sd\\" known as the \\"Funahashi Sd\\" of 1634, which was only suppressed with assistance by the Tokugawa shogunate and resulted in the exile of a number of Nobufusas supporters in 1636. Problems arose again in 1647 in what was called the \\"Tempy Sd\\", with remaining supporters of Nobufusa demanding that Nobuyoshi retire in favor of Nobufusa, alleging misgovernment through excessive drinking and womanizing. The situation was partly resolved by the creation of a semi-autonomous subsidiary holding for Nobufusa based at Kuroishi. The size of the holding was later reduced to 4000 \\"koku\\" after Nobufusa's death. - The , also known as the Meiji era, is a Japanese era which extended from October 23, 1868 through July 30, 1912. This period represents the first half of the Empire of Japan during which Japanese society moved from being an isolated feudal society to its modern form. Fundamental changes affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded with the reign of Emperor Meiji after 1868, and lasted until his death in 1912. It was succeeded by the Taish period upon the accession of Emperor Taish to the throne. - The was a Japanese samurai clan originating in northern Japan, specifically Mutsu Province (the northeast coast of Honsh). A branch of the local Nanbu clan, the Tsugaru rose to power during the AzuchiMomoyama period. It was on the winning side of the Battle of Sekigahara, and entered the Edo period as a family of lords (daimyo) ruling the Hirosaki Domain. A second branch of the family was later established, which ruled the Kuroishi Domain. The Tsugaru survived as a daimyo family until the Meiji Restoration, when Tsugaru Tsuguakira of Hirosaki and Tsugaru Tsugumichi of Kuroishi were relieved of office. Their extended family then became part of the new nobility in the Meiji era. - Lord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles.

Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones.

Here's a question: Where do you visit a dentist? Here are possible answers to this question: - fair - phone book - city - dental office - las vegas I believe the correct choice is \\"dental office\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Visiting a dentist is an essential aspect of maintaining good oral health and hygiene. Dentists are professionals who specialize in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of oral diseases and conditions. They provide a range of services, including regular cleanings, fillings, extractions, and various other dental treatments. While the other possible answers you provided may have some relevance to the context of visiting a dentist, there is only one option that stands out as the most appropriate: \\"dental office.\\" Here are reasons why the other choices do not fit as well: - Fair: While it might be feasible that a dental professional could occasionally attend a fair or community event to provide dental screenings or promote dental health, fairs are generally not a place you would go for routine dental visits. Dentists primarily operate out of dental offices, where they have access to the necessary tools and equipment to perform dental procedures effectively and safely. - Phone book: A phone book is a directory that lists telephone numbers and addresses of individuals and businesses. While you can use a phone book to locate the contact information of a dentist in your area, you need to visit a dental clinic to receive the dental services you are seeking. The phone book merely provides the means of locating a dentist; it is not the actual place where dental procedures are carried out. - City: Although dental offices can be found in cities across the world, the term \\"city\\" is too vague. Dentists can also be found in suburban areas, towns, and even rural communities. The location of a dental office can extend beyond just the boundaries of a city. - Las Vegas: While Las Vegas does have dental offices, it is not exclusively known for dental services. Las Vegas is a city in Nevada, known for its luxurious casinos, resorts, and entertainment options. In the context of visiting a dentist, specifying \\"Las Vegas\\" as the answer implies that all dental visits must happen in Las Vegas, which is not the case. Dentists can be found across the globe in various locations, and one would typically choose a dental office based on convenience, proximity to their home, or other personal preferences. Given these explanations, it's clear that \\"dental office\\" is the correct choice as it directly refers to the specific location where patients go for dental treatment and care. Dental offices are equipped with proper instruments, equipment, and sterilization protocols to ensure that dental procedures are performed safely and effectively. These facilities generally provide a comfortable and hygienic environment for both patients and dental professionals, ensuring that dental care is both accessible and of high quality.

A:","completion":"Land degradation is a serious global issue that negatively impacts the environment in various ways, one of which is indeed flooding. While flooding can sometimes be an effect of land degradation, it is important to note that there are numerous other consequences as well. Here is an overview of some of the key environmental effects caused by land degradation: 1. Flooding: Deforestation and soil erosion can lead to an increased risk of flooding. The absence or reduction of vegetation and tree roots destabilizes the soil structure, making it more prone to being washed away by heavy rainfall. 2. Soil infertility: The loss of topsoil, which is nutrient-rich and vital for supporting plant growth, is a major consequence of land degradation. Without this topsoil, crop yields decrease, and food production suffers. 3. Desertification: As land degrades, arable land can turn into deserts. This occurs through a combination of factors such as erosion, salinization, and reduced vegetation cover, leading to decreased land productivity in affected areas. 4. Loss of biodiversity: With the degradation of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, species that rely on these habitats lose their food sources and experience dramatic population declines. This loss of biodiversity weakens ecosystems, making them less resilient to environmental changes and threatening the services they provide to humans. 5. Increased greenhouse gas emissions: Deforestation and land degradation contribute to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as vegetation plays a vital role in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. What's more, soil holds large amounts of carbon, and when the soil is disturbed, carbon is released, further contributing to climate change. 6. Water pollution: Degraded land often leads to increased siltation and contamination of water sources. Erosion washes topsoil, along with pollutants like fertilizers and pesticides, into rivers and lakes, leading to water quality issues and harming aquatic ecosystems. To summarize, while flooding is one of the environmental effects caused by land degradation, it does not encompass the entire scope of the issue. Land degradation has a wide range of adverse impacts on the environment, including decreased soil fertility, desertification, loss of biodiversity, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Miranda was born Maria do Carmo Miranda da Cunha in Varzea da Ovelha e Aliviada, a village in the northern Portuguese municipality of Marco de Canaveses. She was the second daughter of Jose Maria Pinto da Cunha (17 February 1887 - 21 June 1938) and Maria Emilia Miranda (10 March 1886, Rio de Janeiro - 9 November 1971). In 1909, when Miranda was ten months old, her father emigrated to Brazil and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he opened a barber shop. Desiring creative freedom, Miranda decided to produce her own film in 1947 and played opposite Groucho Marx in Copacabana. The film's budget was divided into about ten investors' shares. A Texan investor who owned one of the shares sent his brother, David Sebastian (23 November 1907 - 11 September 1990), to keep an eye on Miranda and his interests on the set. Sebastian befriended her, and they began dating. Miranda and Sebastian married on 17 March 1947 at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, with Patrick J. Concannon officiating. In 1948 Miranda became pregnant, but miscarried after a show. Although the marriage was brief, Miranda (who was Catholic) did not want a divorce. Her sister, Aurora, said in the documentary Bananas is My Business: \\"He married her for selfish reasons; she got very sick after she married and lived with a lot of depression\\". The couple announced their separation in September 1949, but reconciled several months later. Miranda was discreet, and little is known about her private life. Before she left for the U.S., she had relationships with Mario Cunha, Carlos da Rocha Faria (son of a traditional family in Rio de Janeiro) and Aloysio de Oliveira, a member of the Bando da Lua. In the U.S., Miranda maintained relationships with John Payne, Arturo de Cordova, Dana Andrews, Harold Young, John Wayne, Donald Buka and Carlos Niemeyer.

The surprise cancellation of 86% of the country's currency caused huge disruption. At one point it seemed the entire 1.2 billion population of the world's seventh biggest economy had joined a giant bank queue. But this was much more than an issue of inconvenience, everyone was affected. Remember, virtually all transactions in India are conducted in cash. Businesses stalled, lives were disrupted. Lots of people barely had the money to buy food. \\"We never expected that we would be reduced to becoming destitute in this manner,\\" one of the hundreds of thousands migrant workers who lost their jobs told the BBC in the days after the policy was announced. \\"We never expected our children to go hungry.\\" The cash crisis touched every aspect of life. \\"It's my daughter's wedding tomorrow and I need money to pay for everything. I have nothing at the moment,\\" worried an anxious father in the eastern state of Bihar. \\"They told us to deposit our old money so I have given the bank everything I had, now they are not giving me anything back.\\" With tens of millions of people suffering distressing consequences you'd have thought there would be some blowback for the government now that we know almost all the cash was returned. So why hasn't the country risen up in fury? One reason is that lots of people find all the big numbers and complex details difficult and - frankly - dull. You only need to look at the hundreds of news websites in India to see that. The story barely makes the list of top stories on the sites of the leading TV stations or even the country's biggest newspaper. Another explanation is the success Mr Modi has had in spinning his note ban as a bold attempt to strike a blow to the rich and powerful on behalf of the poor. \\"Those who have indulged in corruption by cheating the poor, cannot have a good night's sleep,\\" he thundered from the ramparts of the Red Fort two weeks ago on the anniversary of India's independence. Thanks to demonetisation, he continued, \\"no one is allowed to cheat in the country any more, everyone is answerable.\\" The figures from the Reserve Bank of India may suggest the policy did not achieve that but, in a country riven with inequality, Mr Modi's message hit home hard. In part that is also because the government changed the emphasis of the policy as soon as it became clear that it wasn't working out quite as planned. First off, demonetisation was all about tackling so-called \\"black money\\". \\"There comes a time in the history of a country's development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step,\\" is what Mr Modi said when he launched the policy on the 8 November last year. \\"For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development.\\" But within a few weeks of that announcement it was already clear that far more money was coming back than the government had expected. So the talk became more about how the policy was a tool to persuade Indians to use less cash and enter the so-called \\"digital economy\\". \\"We can now see a positive momentum towards digital transactions in India,\\" said Mr Modi in a New Year address. \\"More and more people are transacting digitally.\\" There certainly was a dramatic increase in digital transactions but, at the same time, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast for India by one percentage point. The other objective that came to the fore was the effort to tackle India's rampant tax evasion. Because so much business is done in cash here it is very easy to evade tax - and many, many Indians do. Figures released last year showed just 1% of the population paid income tax in 2013. This is one area where the policy may have actually been quite successful. Between 1 April and 5 August more than 5.6 million people filled in their income tax returns this year, according to Mr Modi. Last year the figure was just 2.2 million over the same period. But boredom and political spin aside there is another, even more compelling reason why Indians aren't more annoyed about the shortcomings of the policy. The truth is that, nine months on and the worst hardships of demonetisation are over and, in a country as poor as India, most people have more pressing issues to think about than whether or not a government policy, however disruptive, has worked. This article was about:","completion":"A long time ago, the leader of India made a big decision to cancel 86% of the country's money. This caused a lot of problems for many people in India. Imagine if suddenly, the money you use to buy toys, ice cream, and food was gone! Many people had to wait in long lines at the bank, and some couldn't even buy food for their families. But the leader of India, Mr. Modi, said this was to stop rich and powerful people from cheating and help the poor people. Now, after many months, the situation is better, and people have other things to worry about, like finding jobs or getting enough food for their families. So, even though this big decision caused trouble, people in India are now focusing on other important things in their lives."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The statement from the text perfectly matches with the option \\"ring the bell of the house\\". So it's the right answer. It is important to note that the other options such as \\"knock at the door of the house\\", \\"give a call to his mother\\" or \\"ask his mother some questions\\" have no explicit reference in the text and they are just assumptions or speculation. Always try to choose the option that has direct support from the text, which in this case is \\"ring the bell of the house\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(Associated Press) Sarah Harper,Christopher Lane's girlfriend, stands beside a memorial along the road where police say Lane, an Australian baseball player was shot and killed Friday, Aug. 16, 2013 by three “bored” teenagers... (Associated Press) As the boys appeared in an Oklahoma courtroom, a 17-year-old blurted out, \\"I pulled the trigger,\\" then wept after a judge told him that Tuesday's hearing wasn't the time or place to sort out the facts of the case. Prosecutor Jason Hicks called the boys \\"thugs\\" as he told Stephens County Judge Jerry Herberger how Christopher Lane, 22, of Melbourne, died on a city street. Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards, Jr., 15, of Duncan were charged with first-degree murder and, under Oklahoma law, will be tried as adults. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, of Duncan was accused of using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to first-degree murder after the fact. He is considered a youthful offender but will be tried in adult court. \\"I'm appalled,\\" Hicks said after the hearing. \\"This is not supposed to happen in this community.\\" In court, Hicks said Luna was sitting in the rear seat of a car when he pulled the trigger on a .22 caliber revolver and shot Lane once in the back. Hicks said Jones was driving the vehicle and Edwards was in the passenger seat. Edwards has had run-ins with the law previously and had been in court Friday, the day of the killing, to sign documents related to his juvenile probation. \\"I believe this man is a threat to the community and should not be let out,\\" Hicks said as he requested no bond for Edwards. \\"He thinks it's all a joke.\\" The two younger boys were held without bond; Bond was set at 1 million for Jones. Family and friends on two continents mourned Lane, who gave up pursuit of an Australian football career to pursue his passion for baseball, an American pastime. His girlfriend Sarah Harper tearfully laid a cross at a streetside memorial in Duncan, while half a world away, an impromptu memorial grew at the home plate he protected as a catcher on his youth team. \\"We just thought we'd leave it,\\" Sarah Harper said as she visited the memorial on Duncan's north, well-to-do side. \\"This is his final spot.\\" Flowers, photos and an Australian flag already adorned the roadside in a tribute to Lane. \\"I don't know anybody who's left this. It means a lot,\\" Harper said. Police Chief Dan Ford has said the boys wanted to overcome a boring end to their summer vacation _ classes in Duncan resumed Tuesday _ and that Jones told officers that they were bored and killed Lane for \\"the fun of it.\\" Lane played at East Central University in Ada, 85 miles east of Duncan, and had been visiting Harper and her parents after he and his girlfriend returned to the U.S. from Australia about a week ago. His old team, Essendon, scheduled a memorial game for Sunday to raise funds for Lane's parents as they worked to have their boy's remains sent home. At Essendon Catholic School, Lane will be remembered at a November Mass in which all former students who have died are mourned and celebrated, former school captain David Ireland told The Age newspaper in Melbourne. \\"He was the sort of guy at school who everyone knew and knew quite well,\\" Ireland said of Lane. \\"He loved his footy (Australian football) and his sport and spent a lot of time with mates.\\" Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported that roses and a baseball were placed Monday on the home plate where Lane played as a youth with the message, \\"A wonderful young man taken too soon. Why?\\" Former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer criticized the National Rifle Association and asked Australians to avoid the U.S. as a way to force its Congress to act on gun control. \\"Tourists thinking of going to the USA should think twice,\\" Fischer told the Herald Sun. \\"This is the bitter harvest and legacy of the policies of the NRA that even blocked background checks for people buying guns at gunshows. People should take this into account before going to the United States. I am deeply angry about this because of the callous attitude of the three teenagers (but) it's a sign of the proliferation of guns on the ground in the USA. There is a gun for almost every American.\\" Tara Harper, Sarah Harper's cousin, said her family was working with the Lanes on funeral arrangements but that the girlfriend didn't want to attend court proceedings. \\"She wants nothing to do with them. She doesn't want to see them. She doesn't want to hear them,\\" Tara Harper said. \\"I don't think we'll ever know why it happened. No answer will ever be satisfying, no matter what it is.\\" Police said they had been called to a home in Duncan's gritty east side in response to a possible shooting. At the home Tuesday, pieces of cement with the phrases \\"happiness lives in hearts that love\\" and \\"with God all things are possible\\" written on them sat cracked on the front porch. One window was covered with foil, and cardboard and a satellite dish was perched on the roof. No one answered at the home or at homes next door or across the street. At the site of the shooting, Bill Renfrow, 85, said he saw emergency workers tending to Lane and believed there had been a hit-and-run accident behind his home. \\"It's very saddening. It's a terrible thing to happen. It's so unusual,\\" he said, later adding: \\"He was a guest in the country.\\" ||||| — Two teenagers were charged with first-degree murder Tuesday in the “thrill killing” of an East Central University baseball player from Australia in a case that has sparked international outrage. A third teenager is facing related felonies. “This is not Duncan, Oklahoma. This is not Stephens County, Oklahoma. This is not something that we see happen here,” District Attorney Jason Hicks said after the three teens' first court appearance in the case. Directing comments to “our friends in Australia,” Hicks said, “And I'm going to do everything I can to ensure that that we see these three thugs pay for what they did to Christopher Lane.” James Francis Edwards Jr., 15, and Chancey Allen Luna, 16, were charged with first-degree murder. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, was charged with use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory to first-degree murder after the fact. Hicks said all three were in a car that pulled up behind Lane while he was jogging. He said Luna fired a handgun from the backseat, while Jones drove and Edwards rode as a passenger. Stephens County Special Judge Jerry Herberger denied bail for Luna and Edwards, and set the bail at 1 million for Jones. Luna and Edwards could face up to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Jones could face up to life in prison. Prosecutors can't seek the death penalty because of their young age. High emotions About 75 people packed the courtroom's seats, and another two dozen stood along the walls as the hearing got underway. Lane's family filled most of the front row. Parents and family members of the three teenagers also attended the hearing. The judge warned against any outbursts. “Don't try me on that,” he said. “I do know emotions are running high.” The defendants were brought into the courtroom individually, amid tight security, their hands and legs shackled. They showed no emotion throughout the proceedings. Hicks said the “senseless tragedy” has horrified this southwest Oklahoma community of 23,000 residents and caused some to reflect on the inexplicable nature of the crime. Hicks said there was no connection between the victim and the suspects and that one of the teenagers said they chose to shoot Lane at random simply because they were bored. “I can't imagine anything more appalling,” Hicks said. He said the three youths followed Lane in Jones' 2003 Ford Focus after he ran past a home where they had gathered. Luna shot him in the back with a .22-caliber revolver, the prosecutor said. Two women stopped to help Lane. He was taken to a hospital where he later died. Police used surveillance footage from a local business to identify a car thought to be involved in the shooting. Police then located the teens in the vehicle after a caller reported that juveniles were at his house with guns. According to a probable cause statement, Jones admitted to being involved in the shooting, but said he did not pull the trigger. At almost the time of the killing, Edwards was scheduled to be at the courthouse to meet with the office of juvenile affairs to sign his terms of probation in an unrelated matter, Hicks said. Hicks said Edwards was cold and callous throughout the investigation and when he was being processed into the Stephens County jail he danced at the booking desk. “His demeanor was this whole thing was one big joke,” Hicks said. “He thinks it's funny.” The case has drawn international media coverage and prompted condemnation in Australia where one national leader called on Australian tourists to boycott the U.S. Former Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer was quoted in the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper as saying such a move would send a stern message about the need for tighter gun control. “I am deeply angry about this because of the callous attitude of the three teenagers, (but) it's a sign of the proliferation of guns on the ground in the USA,” said Fischer, who helped lead gun control reforms in Australia in 1996. The three teenagers are next scheduled to appear in court in October. Past killing Lane is the second East Central University student to suffer a violent death in the last eight months. In December, 18-year-old Gennaro Sanchez was kidnapped and killed by a fellow freshman at the Ada school. In that case, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Jerrod Murray, 18, of Asher. In an affidavit, an undersheriff wrote that Murray confessed to killing Sanchez to see how it would feel. Ada is about 90 miles east of Duncan. Lane frequently visited Duncan, where his girlfriend lives.

She does not believe her son was involved in the shooting, saying on Monday he was not a member of a gang and definitely not the one who pulled the trigger. The father of the youngest boy accused of being in the car, a 15-year-old, admitted his son had been in some previous \\"kid stuff\\" trouble with the law, but described him as a good boy who also was not part of a gang. \\"I don't think so,\\" the father replied when asked if his son could have been part of the murder. \\"Because he's not the type of person. He likes to wrestle. He's into sports.\\" The two teens have suffered tragic lives, their parents said. The 15-year-old's mother is in jail. The 16-year-old last year dealt with the death of his stepfather and brother. The two boys, along with the 17-year-old who told police he was driving the black Ford Focus, have been locked up in Stephens County Jail since their arrest on Friday and may never spend another day of their lives free. District Attorney Jason Hicks will announce on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) at the boys' arraignment what charges the trio will face. If it is first-degree murder, they can be sentenced to a maximum term of life in prison. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford says he has secured the confession of the 17-year-old who summoned investigators to his jail cell on Sunday and claimed he and the younger boys were bored \\"so they decided to kill somebody\\". \\"He said he was the driver of the car,\\" Chief Ford said. \\"They saw Christopher jog by the house they were at, they chose him to be the target, they got in the car, drove up behind him and shot him in the back. \\"He said the 16-year-old fired the shot.\\" The murder of 22-year-old Mr Lane, who was staying with his girlfriend Sarah Harper in Duncan ahead of going back to Oklahoma's East Central University where he majored in finance and was the catcher on the team's baseball team, is the talk of Duncan. The locals are disgusted their once peaceful, largely law-abiding city has attracted negative international publicity. They fear gangs are corrupting their youth and they want the Lanes in Melbourne and Ms Harper's family to know they are in their prayers. Ms Harper visited the site on Monday where her boyfriend took his last breath - on the side of the road near the corner of Twilight Beach and Country Club Road. An Australian flag, flowers and a sign which reads \\"Rest in peace Chris\\" and the psalm \\"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in times of trouble\\" have been placed as a memorial. Ms Harper said she didn't care what happened to the accused. \\"I feel that if they don't get what they deserve now in the present they will eternally,\\" she said. \\"They're evil people and they'll be taken care of eventually.\\" The 16-year-old's mother said her son should be punished if guilty, but not for the rest of his life. \\"I know he didn't pull the trigger,\\" she said. |||||Summary:","completion":"In 2013, three teenagers in Duncan, Oklahoma, tragically killed Australian collegiate baseball player Christopher Lane.

The reviewer starts by expressing their personal bias towards foxes and fox stories and states that they found the story \\"wonderfully done.\\" This implies that they had a positive and enjoyable experience while watching the movie. Further, they emphasize the importance of showing uncomfortable situations in the movie, specifically mentioning Lily's discomfort. They consider this aspect valuable for children to learn and understand, enhancing the positive sentiment towards the movie. However, there is a degree of confusion when the reviewer discusses the movie's ending. They mention different versions of the ending as per other viewers' comments and seek clarification. This shows a slight scarcity of understanding, but it does not affect the overall sentiment of the review significantly. Furthermore, the reviewer talks about certain scenes being slow and potentially difficult for high-energy kids to watch, which is a minor criticism. Nonetheless, they still recommend the movie if the targeted audience can sit still, maintaining the positive sentiment throughout.

They are placing chickens at fixed points all along their 2,500 km border with the United States of America. It's not a joke, nor have the Canadians gone mad. They are using these chickens to see if the West Nile virus is still around. The virus infects birds, so the chickens have a chance of catching the virus and fall ill. The West Nile virus is spread among humans. It killed seven people in New York last year. Countries around the world are realizing that it may just be possible to stop certain kinds of people from entering their land. However, it is very difficult to stop viruses traveling from one end of the earth to another. When they travel to new places, they get used to the environment very easily and sometimes start destroying the local plant and animal life. These biological polluters are called smart polluters. These smart polluters can be carried across borders of countries unknowingly. Just as we humans are travelling across the world more often than earlier, these biological polluters have also started journey much more. They slide into airplanes through their wheels. They dig into objects that travelers may be carrying from one country to another. There are some good examples of how these polluters work. The water hyacinth of South America is blocking lakes in China and Africa. Tree snakes from Papua New Guinea are busy eating up some birds in the country of Guam, which breaks its natural balance. That's why the customs officials in many foreign countries prevent people from bringing in a small plant, or an object made of wood that is in its natural form. The customs officials have these rules because these varieties of plants are special to certain places. The plants have the power to spread new illnesses among native plants and animals. Biological polluters always create problems in places where they do not belong. They could be special varieties of plants, bugs or even animals. Which of the following is TRUE?

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: \\"Slow City\\" -- a recently launched project focused on preserving the traditional quality of life enjoyed in some of Italy's smaller cities and towns. The project was born from the idea of the \\"Slow Food\\" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style. \\"The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same. We want to stop this kind of globalization,\\" says Paolo Saturnini, an Italian mayor. The \\"Slow City\\" project plans to emphasize the rich, cultural, culinary and artistic local traditions of each community. Walking areas will be enlarged and squares and parks will be made greener with more plants. Car alarms and other noise that disturbs the peace will be banned, and ugly TV aerials , advertising posters, and signs will be taken down. City councils will also insist on the use of recycling and renewable energy sources, and will also introduce ecological transport systems. Parking will be made stress-free by creating more public parking areas, and easily accessible walkways and bike lanes will cross the city. But in the \\"Slow City\\" way, all improvements will probably come about slowly. Thirty-two Italian city councils, which joined the \\"Slow City\\" program, have decided to take further steps in this direction by increasing the numbers of traditional family-style eating establishments, reducing noise pollution, and concentrating on making their towns friendlier for people to live in. Organic local produce will be promoted in all restaurants and genetically modified foods will be banned. \\"We can't stop large, fast-food chains from coming here, but we hope that people who come to our towns will not want to eat exactly the same hamburger they can eat in Melbourne, London or Paris, but want something genuine and different,\\" said Saturnini. Question: Further measures will be included in the \\"Slow City\\" program EXCEPT _ .

Please answer the following question: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Would Neptune have slower or faster speed than Earth? A:","completion":"To determine if Neptune has a slower or faster speed than Earth, we need to consider the factors affecting a planet's orbital speed, which are mainly its distance from the Sun and the gravitational force it experiences. Let's analyze this step by step: 1. Distance from the Sun: Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, while Earth is closer to the Sun. As mentioned in your text, this factor affects a planet's orbital speed. 2. Gravitational force: The farther a planet is from its star, the less affected it is by its star's gravity. So, Neptune experiences less gravitational force from the Sun compared to Earth. Considering these factors, Neptune would have a slower orbital speed than Earth. This is due to its greater distance from the Sun and its weaker gravitational interaction. The larger distance not only requires Neptune to travel a longer path but also results in a slower speed because of the reduced gravitational pull from the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it’s meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people over the years, one thing remains the same: LOVE. In 2019, we’re celebrating 50 Years of Love with special experiences across the state. Stay tuned to Virginia.org for details. \\"Virginia is for Lovers\\" on Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame By popular vote, \\"Virginia is for Lovers\\" was inducted into the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame on September 21, 2009. The slogan was included in the Advertising Icon Museum alongside fellow 2009 inductees, the AOL Running Man, the Budweiser Clydesdales, and State Farm's \\"Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm is There.\\" This recognition came on the heels of Forbes.com tapping \\"Virginia is for Lovers\\" as one of the top ten tourism marketing campaigns of all time. The Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame (located between 42nd and 50th streets in New York City) was created by Advertising Week, the largest gathering of advertising, media and marketing professionals in North America. The Grand Central Partnership and Advertising Week organizers have brought the Walk of Fame to life with a combination of bronze plaques and permanent lamppost street banners on Madison Avenue. The Walk of Fame was created to celebrate great advertising icons and slogans, as well as recognize their business and role in brand building. The Year was 1969 The timing was right in 1969 when the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) adopted what would become its world-renowned \\"Virginia is for Lovers\\" slogan. The Travel Service could not have known that the Yippies would become Yuppies — and later, Boomers — or that the Volkswagen microbus with the peace sign on the dashboard would give way to the station wagon as the official car of a generation, but they knew where the future was in tourism: a new generation of visitors. A favorite book in 1969 was Erich Segal’s Love Story. Jacqueline Susann’s The Love Machine was a best seller. Henry Mancini scored with Love Theme from \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" The Woodstock Music and Art Fair in 1969 drew more than 300,000 young people for a weekend of peace, music and mud. Given the tenor of the times, the roll-out of \\"Virginia is For Lovers\\" appealed to younger consumers who were the market of the future. The Ad Agency The phrase came from a creative team headed by George Woltz of Martin & Woltz Inc., the Richmond advertising agency that won the Virginia State Travel Service account in 1968. According to Martin, a 100-a-week copywriter named Robin McLaughlin came up with an advertising concept that read, \\"Virginia is for history lovers.\\" For a beach-oriented ad, the headline would have read, \\"Virginia is for beach lovers\\"; for a mountains ad, \\"Virginia is for mountain lovers,\\" and so on. Martin thought the approach might be too limiting. Woltz agreed, and the agency dropped the modifier and made it simply \\"Virginia is for Lovers.\\" The new slogan debuted in a 1969 issue of \\"Modern Bride.\\" The phrase was considered bold and provocative, but it was also just plain smart from a marketing perspective. It planted a seed — a new image of a more exciting Virginia — with a generation that would become the most sought-after group of spenders ever to wield a credit card. Virginia is for Lovers of . . . No one knows exactly why \\"Virginia is for Lovers\\" has been so durable, but part of the mystique of the slogan is that it has meant many things to different people. Today, a new generation is discovering love for Virginia’s mountains, beaches, history, theme parks, vibrant cities, outdoor activities, sports and hospitality. And the love story continues. ||||| There's something in the water in Australia's Northern Territory a.k.a. the NT. If you've ever had the pleasure of reading the always-entertaining NT News, or checked out the \\"fun\\" tourist activities on offer, you've probably figured out that Territorians have more of a rough (and sweary) vibe than other Australians. Now, a new tourism campaign called \\"CU in the NT\\" has made that fact plainly obvious. Created by a group called NT Official, there's no prizes for guessing what swear word the campaign is alluding to. The NT Official website is selling shirts and singlets bearing the cheeky slogan.

Its typography and logos are satirised versions of the official NT Tourism look and feel. \\"We are a fronted by a guerrilla group of people with the aim of promoting travel awareness to the Northern Territory region,\\" a spokesperson from NT Official said in an emailed statement. \\"We want people to recognise that if they want to go to the NT they shouldn't hesitate. They should just go and tell their friends to 'CU in the NT!'\\" Got your attention at least, didn't it? ||||| Warning: This article contains language which may offend some people. It's the kind of tourism slogan that would kick you right between the legs. But contrary to earlier reports, a particularly crass line of merchandise in Australia's Northern Territory has not come from official sources. A company that calls itself 'NT Official' released a range of t-shirts which boldly says \\"CU [in the] NT\\". \\"The top end. Different from the bottom end,\\" the merchandise reads. Needless to say the slogan bears a remarkable closeness to a certain expletive. The company's bold name lead many to believe the real Northern Territory government had truly embraced the bogan; Mumbrella reported that the shirts were official products from \\"the good folk at NT Tourism\\". However, Suzanne Morgan, director of domestic marketing at Tourism NT, told Newshub that they are in “no way affiliated with the website or Facebook page of NTOfficial.com or any of their promotions”. “We will not be commenting on this activity,” she said. The shirts and singlets include images of crocodiles, kangaroos and barramundis. Though it seems the merchandise is a grab for younger or cruder demographics, NT Official's website promises enjoyment for all. \\"Whether you're young or old there's so much to see and do in the NT!\\" says the company's website. \\"Grab your squad and jump in a fourbie and explore the top end!\\" Newshub. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"\\"Virginia is for Lovers,\\" an iconic slogan in the world of advertising and tourism, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019.

What were the full names of the two people who calculated the critical mass of uranium? Answer the above question based on the context below: At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...

Determine the sentiment: Criticism of the film EVENING, based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc. For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred. Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'Harris' - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson). As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila's alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to, feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), her housekeeper's son who had become a physician. Harris, Buddy, Lila, and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as Ann is dying. The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.' The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons. Yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words, such 'holes' are understandable. The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave, Richardson (Redgrave's true daughter), Collette, Gummer (Streep's true daughter), Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances. The setting is gorgeous (cinematography by Gyula Pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P. Kaczmarek. Lajos Koltai (\\"Being Julia') directs. Judge this film on your own.... Grady Harp","completion":"This sentiment of the text seems to be mixed, but leans towards a positive and reflective interpretation. The author acknowledges the harsh criticism that the film has received, but they express a different experience while viewing it. They describe the film's character exploration, storytelling, and atmosphere as delicate and rich, and appreciate its subtlety and life lessons. Despite recognizing the flaws or gaps in the story, the author suggests viewers judge the film for themselves, implying that individual experiences may differ."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

U.S. Marines Try to Retake Afghan Valley From Taliban In recent weeks some British troops have been setting up what are known as “blocking positions” on bridges over irrigation canals and at other locations, apparently to help stop the flow of insurgents during the main military operation and to establish greater security before the presidential election scheduled for August. The British forces, whose main base in Helmand is adjacent to the main Marine base, will continue to support the new operation. The British have had too few troops to conduct full-scale counterinsurgency operations and have often relied on heavy aerial weapons, including bombs and helicopter gunships, to attack suspected fighters and their hideouts. The strategy has alienated much of the population because of the potential for civilian deaths. Now, the Marines say their new mission, called Operation Khanjar, will include more troops and resources than ever before, as well as a commitment by the troops to live and patrol near population centers to ensure that residents are protected. More than 600 Afghan soldiers and police officers are also involved. “What makes Operation Khanjar different from those that have occurred before is the massive size of the force introduced, the speed at which it will insert, and the fact that where we go we will stay, and where we stay, we will hold, build and work toward transition of all security responsibilities to Afghan forces,” the Marine commander in Helmand Province, Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, said in a statement released after the operation began. The Marines will be pushing into areas where NATO and Afghan troops have not previously established a permanent presence. As part of the counterinsurgency strategy, the troops will meet with local leaders, help determine their needs and take a variety of actions to make towns and villages more secure, said Capt. Bill Pelletier, a spokesman for the Marines, according to The Associated Press. “We do not want people of Helmand Province to see us as an enemy; we want to protect them from the enemy,” Captain Pelletier said, The A.P. reported. The goal of the operation is to put pressure on the Taliban militants “and to show our commitment to the Afghan people that when we come in we are going to stay long enough to set up their own institutions,” he said. The 21,000 additional American troops that Mr. Obama authorized after taking office in January almost precisely matches the original number of additional troops that President George W. Bush sent to Iraq two years ago. It will bring the overall American deployment in Afghanistan to more than 60,000 troops. But Mr. Obama avoided calling it a surge and resisted sending the full reinforcements initially sought by military commanders. Instead, Mr. Obama chose to re-evaluate troop levels over the next year, officials said. The Obama administration has said that the additional American commitment has three main strategies for denying havens for the Taliban and Al Qaeda: training Afghan security forces, supporting the weak central Afghan government in Kabul and securing the population. In late March, Mr. Obama warned Congressional leaders that he would need more than the 50 billion in his budget for military operations and development efforts. Asked by lawmakers about the prospect of reconciliation with moderate members of the Taliban, officials said Mr. Obama replied that he wanted to sift out hard-core radicals from those who were fighting simply to earn money.

On April 10, 1963, Bull Connor obtained an injunction barring the protests and subsequently raised bail bond for those arrested from 200 to 1,500 (2,000 to 10,000 in 2019). Fred Shuttlesworth called the injunction a \\"flagrant denial of our constitutional rights\\" and organizers prepared to defy the order.

King and the SCLC had obeyed court injunctions in their Albany protests and reasoned that obeying them contributed to the Albany campaign's lack of success. In a press release they explained, \\"We are now confronted with recalcitrant forces in the Deep South that will use the courts to perpetuate the unjust and illegal systems of racial separation\\".

Connor promised, \\"You can rest assured that I will fill the jail full of any persons violating the law as long as I'm at City Hall.\\"The movement organizers found themselves out of money after the amount of required bail was raised.

Mariko changed from skirt to kimono before miss USA competition because the","completion":"traditional Japanese garment showcases her unique cultural heritage and personal style while also demonstrating the importance of embracing diversity and multiculturalism within the Miss USA competition. Mariko, a confident and proud Japanese-American contestant, was keenly aware of the influence she holds on the international stage, as millions of people watch the Miss USA competition every year. By wearing a kimono, she not only showcases the intricate craftsmanship and vibrant colors characteristic of this iconic garment, but also establishes herself as a role model for individuals of all cultural backgrounds to admire and emulate. One of the underlying themes of the Miss USA competition is to promote cultural exchange among its participants and viewers, therefore Mariko's decision to wear a kimono serves as a strategic move to remind everyone that the true essence of beauty lies in the diverse expressions of personal identity. As contestants from various countries come together, they bring with them a rich tapestry of cultural experiences that enhance the overall competition and provide a platform for a broader conversation on the significance of cultural heritage in contemporary society. Additionally, Mariko's choice to don a kimono resonates deeply with her own personal values. By wearing the traditional garment, she stays true to herself, preserving her cultural roots and honoring her identity as a Japanese-American. This decision speaks to her resilience and unwavering self-confidence in an increasingly globalized world where sometimes unique cultural identities can be overlooked or diluted. Furthermore, by wearing a kimono, Mariko effectively breaks the mold of conventional beauty standards and challenges the norms around pageant attire. It allows her to express herself authentically, reinforcing the idea that beauty transcends borders and cannot be contained within a singular definition. Her kimono sends a powerful message to the audience and jury that she stands for diverse representation and promoting inclusivity. Lastly, Mariko's choice to wear a kimono fosters a sense of curiosity and intrigue among the audience members. The Miss USA competition often captivates viewers due to the pageantry and elegance of its contestants, however, Mariko's attire distinguishes her from the rest, creating a unique visual impact. As people from around the world tune in to watch the competition, her presence on stage wearing a traditional Japanese kimono may inspire others to learn about and appreciate the rich culture and history of Japan. In conclusion, Mariko's decision to change from a skirt to a kimono before the Miss USA competition serves several purposes. It highlights her cultural heritage, redefines beauty standards, encourages multiculturalism, honors her personal values, and sparks curiosity about Japanese culture from spectators worldwide. It showcases the essence of what the Miss USA competition seeks to promote: diversity, inclusivity, and the celebration of cultural exchange."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To avoid getting soupy trash at the bottom of your trash cans, there are various methods and practices you can adopt. I will outline several of them below and explain which makes more sense for accomplishing this goal. Method 1: Separating wet and dry waste One way to prevent soupy trash is to separate wet waste (food scraps, decomposable materials, etc.) from dry waste (paper, plastic, etc.). Use two different trash cans or bins for this purpose and ensure that they're properly labeled to avoid confusion. Pros: - Reduces smell and potential for leakage of wet waste. - Makes recycling dry waste easier, since it's no longer contaminated by wet waste. - Decreases overall trash volume. Cons: - Having two separate trash cans may become impractical in some households. - Requires diligence and effort in sorting waste materials. Method 2: Using thick, heavy-duty trash bags Investing in quality, heavy-duty trash bags may reduce the chances of a wet, soggy bottom in your trash can. Thicker trash bags are more resistant to tearing and leaks, effectively holding wet waste better. Pros: - Thicker bags prevent leakage, even when in contact with some wet waste. - More convenient than separating waste materials. Cons: - Heavy-duty bags are more expensive than regular trash bags. - Leakage may still occur when too many liquid waste elements are present. Method 3: Drain wet waste before disposing of it. Before disposing of liquid or wet waste items, drain them off as much as possible. This method is helpful when there is a significant amount of liquid waste, such as leftover food, beverages, etc. Pros: - Reduces overall trash weight. - Lowers the risk of soupy trash. Cons: - Takes more time and effort than using thicker trash bags. - Inefficient in situations where liquid waste is difficult to drain. Method 4: Use absorbent material in the trash can. Placing an absorbent material, such as paper towels, newspapers, or sawdust in the bottom of the trash can help absorb excess moisture from wet waste. Pros: - Easy and inexpensive solution. - Can be made using readily available materials at home. Cons: - Requires regular replacement after each trash disposal. - May not be effective if the amount of wet waste is too high. Based on these methods, the most efficient approach to preventing soupy trash is Method 1: separating wet and dry waste. While it may take a bit more effort and diligence, not only does it solve the problem of soupy trash, but it also contributes to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. Adopting this method makes recycling more accessible, as dry waste remains uncontaminated and easier to transport. However, it's essential to also acknowledge and implement other methods that fit your personal lifestyle. If constant sorting isn't feasible, a combination of using thick heavy-duty trash bags (Method 2), draining wet waste (Method 3), and utilizing absorbent materials (Method 4) can be employed to avoid soupy trash and keep the bottom of your trash cans mess-free."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: apart from cricket which other sport uses a bat? A:","completion":"Apart from cricket, several other sports use a bat. Some of the notable ones include: 1. Baseball: Baseball is a widely popular sport, especially in North America, Japan, and parts of Central and South America. It is played between two teams, with nine players each. A pitcher throws a ball towards a batter from the opposing team, who tries to hit the ball using a round, wooden or metal bat. The batting team aims to score runs by completing circuits around the four bases on the field. 2. Softball: Softball is a variant of baseball, played primarily in the United States and Canada. Played with a larger ball and a shorter field, the game consists of two teams taking turns at batting and fielding. The objective is the same as baseball: to hit the ball with a bat and score runs by running around the bases. Softball bats are traditionally made of wood, aluminum, or composite materials. 3. Table tennis (ping-pong): Table tennis is a popular indoor sport played worldwide. It involves two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth on a table with small, wooden paddles. While the equipment differs from the traditional bat, it is still referred to as a racket or bat. Table tennis focuses on precision, speed, and reflexes. 4. Rounders: Rounders is a bat-and-ball game of British origin and a predecessor of baseball and cricket. In rounders, players strike a lightweight ball with a round wooden bat and proceed to run around the four rounded bases on the field. The game is commonly played in the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially among school children. 5. Stickball: Stickball is a street game played primarily in North America, closely related to baseball but without the need for as much equipment. A broomstick or similar long, slender object is used as a makeshift bat, while a ball (often a rubber spaldeen) is thrown by a pitcher. The game was popularized in cities like New York City and Philadelphia and is still played recreationally today. 6. Pesäpallo (Finnish baseball): Pesäpallo is a Finnish sport that combines elements of traditional baseball, football, and cricket. The game is played with a bat and a ball, with the objective of scoring runs by hitting the ball and running the bases. It is Finland's national sport and is played in the Nordic countries and some parts of Europe as well. The bat is typically 72–92 cm in length, with a flat spade-like hitting surface. These are just a few examples of sports that rely on some form of bat-like instrument. Bat-and-ball sports are diverse and span many different cultures and regions globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

(Photo: 104th Fighter Wing) The crash occurred shortly after 9 a.m. west of Staunton in the rural community of Deerfield in Augusta County (about 135 miles northwest of Richmond). The area around Deerfield is filled with rocky, steep terrain. Residents who live in the town of 130 people were shaken when they heard a series of explosions-like booms and then saw a pillar of heavy, black smoke coming from the crash site. \\"It's the loudest noise I've ever heard,\\" said 63-year-old Rebecca Shinaberry, who lives on a farm about two miles away. \\"(It) just shook the ground, and from my house we could just see a big plume of smoke.\\" Turkey farmer A.D. Shinaberry said that from the first two booms, he thought a plane had broken the sound barrier. But 10 seconds later he heard a third boom - the crash, he said. Then, \\"it was like a mushroom, black smoke came up,\\" Shinaberry said. No injuries on the ground were reported. Virginia State Police launched a helicopter to search for the pilot, who may have ejected from the plane before impact. Witnesses reportedly saw an ejection chute. \\"We are hopeful that the pilot is OK, and the pilot will be in our thoughts and prayers,\\" said Col. James Keefe, commander of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. State troopers and firefighters followed the smoke from Deerfield about five miles into the forest, where they found a deep crater and a large debris field among the hills and mountains. Rescuers initially expressed concern about possible toxic fumes and radioactive materials, but Keefe said the plane had no munitions aboard - just fuel. Guard officials confirmed to ABC7 News that communication with the jet had been lost prior to the crash; the pilot reported an \\"in-flight emergency\\" moments before radio contact ceased. The plane was traveling at a high altitude, about 30,000 to 40,000 feet, when the \\"extremely experienced\\" pilot reported encountering a problem, officials said. The jet was on a maintenance flight from Barnes Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts. which is home to the 104th Fighter Wing. Base officials told ABC7 the crashed jet was an older aircraft due to receive a system upgrade upon arrival at its flight destination in New Orleans, Louisiana. F-15s are maneuverable tactical fighters that can reach speeds up to 1,875 mph, according to the U.S. Air Force website. The F-15C Eagle entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and costs nearly 30 million, the website says. The Air Force has nearly 250 of them. A Massachusetts Guard spokesman said he \\"couldn't even remember the last time they had a mishap\\" with the F-15C model aircraft. But the Associated Press reported that several F-15s have crashed over the past few years in various states. In at least one, the pilot ejected safely. Causes included failure of a support structure for the jet and pilot error. ||||| DEERFIELD, Va.

The pilot of the single-seat F-15C was with the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard in Westfield, spokesman Maj. Matthew Mutti said. The jet was on a standard training exercise with no munition onboard, Mutti said. He didn't say where it was headed or release the pilot's name. Military officials in Washington told local authorities in Augusta County that they had lost communication with a jet, according to Augusta County dispatcher Becky Coynter.

James Keefe of the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard said at a news conference in Westfield, Massachusetts, that the missing pilot is an experienced flyer. He said the jet was on its way to New Orleans to have a radar installed as part of routine maintenance. \\"Information on this incident is developing rapidly, and we are not going to speculate on what occurred or the status of the pilot,\\" Col James Keefe, 104th Fighter Wing Commander, said in a statement. \\"We are hopeful that the pilot is OK, and the pilot will be in our thoughts and prayers.\\" No injuries were reported on the ground as authorities located the crash site through heavy smoke on a mountainside. The crash is in a rural part of the county near Deerfield, which is a small community west of Staunton and just miles from the West Virginia state line. The crash happened in the middle of the George Washington Forest. We're told the debris is spread out across a field up near the highest mountain peak in Augusta County, which is making the investigation much more complicated. Corinne Geller with Virginia State Police said, \\"The wreckage site is a large debris field. It's up against Elliott's Knob, and it's in kind of a flattened area along the knob there, heavily wooded and at this time we have a lot of resources deployed in the search and rescue efforts.\\" A helicopter, hazmat crews and emergency responders are on the scene. Virginia State Police and the Augusta County Sheriff's Office blocked off the road near the scene and set up a command center. Crews are searching about a 20-mile radius. Crews had to treat it as a hazmat situation because of the jet fuel. Officials say the cleanup is not going to be a quick process because of toxic chemicals. The Massachusetts Air National Guard says there were no weapons or any sort of ammunition on board the plane. According to the Air Force website, F-15s are maneuverable tactical fighters that can reach speeds of up to 1,875 mph. The F-15C Eagle entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and costs nearly 30 million, the website says. The Air Force has nearly 250 of them. The Associated Press contributed to this article. At 9:06 a.m. Wednesday (Aug. 27, 2014), Virginia State Police were notified of a plane crash in the Deerfield community of Augusta County. A crash site has been visually located due to heavy smoke coming from the side of a nearby mountain. State police, with the assistance of the Augusta County Sheriff's Office, are working to reach the crash site at this time. There have been no reported injuries on the ground – meaning no local residents have been injured as a result of the crash. VSP is not confirming the type of aircraft until crews reach the wreckage.

Bigger, faster tight ends pace NFL playoff teams All the talk coming into this season was about the lockout. But as we enter the second season - the NFL playoffs, which start with two games today - people should be screaming about the lockup of defensive players. With helmet-to-helmet penalties being called without real guidelines and quarterbacks protected like never before, defensive players don't have much of a chance. Especially when you start putting 6-foot-6, 265-pound freaks like Rob Gronkowski in the middle of the field. The Patriots tight end broke the NFL records for receptions (90), receiving yards (1,327) and touchdowns (17) at his position, and he needed a last-minute garbage-time play to do it. The Saints' 6-6, 260-pound Jimmy Graham had finished with 1,310 yards (and 11 touchdowns) earlier Sunday to break Kellen Winslow's 1980 record of 1,290 yards. \\"He deserved that,\\" New England coach Bill Belichick said of the 22-yard pass with 90 seconds left and the Patriots up on the Bills by 28 points. It may have been the equivalent of hanging on the rim, but that's OK because many of these dominant tight ends are former basketball players who are too big for opposing safeties and too quick and athletic for linebackers. Fourteen tight ends - including the 49ers' Vernon Davis - had at least 750 yards receiving this season. (And that doesn't count the Houston Texans, who had Owen Daniels and Joel Dreesen combine for 1,002.) It's a big reason, along with the flags flying everywhere, why a record 11,356 points were scored in the NFL. The three quarterbacks who threw for 5,000 yards each have a big Transformer at tight end, and New England's Tom Brady has two. Besides Gronkowski, Aaron Hernandez had 79 catches for 910 yards. In fact, every team in the playoffs except for Denver has a big, play-making tight end. Falcons coach Mike Smith says it's all because of one man: former Cal power forward and current Atlanta tight end Tony Gonzalez. The all-time leader with 1,149 catches, 13,338 yards and 95 touchdowns. The Godfather. \\"That may be the best way to describe him,\\" Smith told reporters. \\"Without a doubt, he is one of the greatest tight ends to play the game. He is probably one of the first guys to change the position in terms of his athleticism. ... He was probably the first one of basketball-type players, and there have been a handful of followers that have had the success, but Tony's work ethic is unbelievable.\\" In his 15th year, the 6-5, 247-pound Gonzalez was fifth among tight ends with 80 catches for 875 yards. Amazingly, he has never won a playoff game with either the Chiefs or Falcons - but that will change Sunday. We have Gonzalez and the Falcons surprising a lot of people this month, starting with a win over the Giants (see playoff capsules). Matt Ryan has gone from getting too much hype to not enough (career-high 29 touchdown passes), and Atlanta is 22-4 when Michael Turner runs for more than 100 yards. And forget about the Packers and Saints, the Falcons have the second-best defense in the NFC besides the 49ers. After the Saints take care of business against the Lions today, they travel to San Francisco. And like most teams, they have no idea how physical and nasty the 49ers' defense is. They will lose to the 49ers, and the Packers will lose to the Falcons, who will expose Green Bay's 32nd-ranked defense. The magic carpet ride will end for Alex Smith, however, in the NFC title game against the Falcons, who will shut down Frank Gore. In the AFC, there will be another miracle Sunday. The Broncos somehow won six in a row this season, many believe, because of a divine hand rather than the wobbly arm of Tim Tebow. Now, after three losses, nobody believes again. Hello? The big fella in the sky puts the Broncos jersey back on this weekend. Denver beats Pittsburgh and Houston beats Cincinnati, setting up New England and Baltimore for easy wins next weekend. In the AFC title game, the Patriots will make the Ravens' defense look old again, as it has looked several times this season. Then, the Patriots will beat the Falcons for Brady's fourth Super Bowl ring. For the simple reason that the San Mateo kid has two tight ends to play with and Ryan has only one.

The rising significance of tight ends in the NFL, such as Rob Gronkowski and Jimmy Graham, who are able to make successful plays due to their size and athletic prowess. Gronkowski broke NFL records for receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns and Graham surpassed Kellen Winslow's 1980 record. 2. This increasing prominence of tight ends, many of whom are former basketball players, is noted as a contributing factor to the record 11,356 points scored in the NFL. 3. Tony Gonzalez's influence on the evolution of the tight end role is highlighted. Known as the \\"Godfather\\", Gonzalez combined incredible athleticism with exceptional work ethics, becoming an all-time leader with impressive stats. 4. The discussion about the upcoming playoffs, with focus on various teams and their prospects. For instance, the Falcons are expected to cause surprises starting with a win over the Giants, though the Patriots are favored to win the Super Bowl due to having two play-making tight ends, versus Ryan's Falcons who only have one. 5. Lastly, the article delves into the speculated outcomes of various games, suggesting that teams with strong tight ends are likely to succeed due to the significant shift in football strategy. Each of these points are critical because they discuss both the changing dynamics of football related to player roles, particularly the role of the tight end, along with competitive speculations. The trend mentioned showcases the evolving strategies in professional football, while the playoff forecasts help generate excitement and anticipation among the fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"Being on a diet may indirectly impact a step of the exocrine pancreas process. Step-by-step justification: 1. Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices. Being on a diet does not directly affect the production of digestive juices by these cells. 2. They secrete digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine. The process of secretion will not be directly affected by being on a diet. 3. There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. A diet might change the proportion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates consumed, but it will not directly impact the production of these enzymes. 4. Digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine - This step is not directly impacted by a diet. 5. When blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released. Being on a diet can indirectly impact this step, as consuming a different balance of foods or eating less frequently might impact blood sugar levels and the need for insulin release. 6. When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream. A diet could indirectly impact this step as well, depending on the type and timing of meals which might result in either higher or lower blood sugar levels during various points in the day. So, being on a diet could indirectly impact a step of the exocrine pancreas process – specifically the steps related to insulin and glucagon release. The body's adjustment to the diet and changes in macronutrient intake could affect the balance of these hormones and ultimately have an impact on pancreatic function."},{"prompt":"Instructions: Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.

Given the below context: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut... Guess a valid title for it!

Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Google hauled in by Europe over ‘right to be forgotten’ reaction Google is being hauled in front of European data protection regulators on Thursday to explain its handling of the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The ECJ ruling meant that EU citizens had the right to request that information online that is inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive be removed from search listings and other non-media websites. Google's interpretation has been a high publicity approach, encouraging a wide debate about the complexity of the ruling and introducing a removal request form to its website. The company is judging each case independently, and then removing some requested links from search results that specifically mention the relevant name and subject. \\"Google is a massive commercial organisation making millions and millions out of processing people's personal information. They're going to have to do some tidying up,” the Information Commissioner Christopher Graham told Radio 5 live Thursday morning. Google will join Microsoft and Yahoo in a meeting in Brussels today to discuss the fallout from the ruling and the actions taken to respond to the ruling. The Guardian understands that Google has seen regulators privately and publicly applying pressure, given their dissatisfaction over its methods, including its notification of websites on removal of their links from the search index. Google received more 12,000 requests for link removals within 24 hours of its European web form to handle requests being online. That number rose to 70,000 removal requests in less than two months. Google began removing links, including those to Guardian articles, in June. Many have seen the removals as censorship, with websites set up to expose those links that have been removed under the ruling. The alerts over link removals have also caused news organisations to highlight the removals meaning that those seeking to be “forgotten” end up back in the public eye. \\"All this talk about rewriting history and airbrushing embarrassing bits from your past - this is nonsense, that's not going to happen,\\" Graham said discounting fears that removal of links from search impacted the wealth of public knowledge. The meeting of regulators and search companies, known as the Article 29 Working Party, could place further restrictions and give strict guidance on how Google and other search engines respond to removal requests. Google publicly expressed dismay on the ECJ’s ruling. Former chief executive Eric Schmidt said in May that “Google believes, having looked at the decision which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.” Larry Page, Google chief executive, also expressed concern that the ruling will be “used by other governments that aren’t as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things\\", though has since distanced himself from that position. Google initially made it known that a paedophile, politician and doctor were among the initial removal requests, but has since acknowledged more diverse and compelling claims. \\"The issues at stake here are important and difficult, but we're committed to complying with the court's decision,\\" wrote David Drummond, Google's legal officer. \\"Indeed, it's hard not to empathise with some of the requests that we've seen – from the man who asked that we do not show a news article saying that he had been questioned in connection with a crime (he's able to demonstrate that he was never charged) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter's name as she had been the victim of abuse.\\" Google’s link removals only affect its website domains within Europe, with the links still visible on sites like google.com outside the Union. • A manifesto for the future of the 'right to be forgotten' debate Summary:","completion":"European data protection regulators have called on Google to discuss its approach to the \\"right to be forgotten\\" ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The ECJ ruled that EU citizens have the right to request the removal of inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive information from search listings. Google has been dealing with these removal requests on a case-by-case basis. The meeting of regulators, which includes Microsoft and Yahoo, could lead to further restrictions and stricter guidance on how search engines should handle such requests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Answer this question please: Which parcel of land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","completion":"Tom's forested land had an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, in forests precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, resulting in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers.

Translate to English","completion":"In April 1992, he took over the command of the JNA's Second Military District, headquartered in Sarajevo. In April 1992, the individual in question took over the command of the Second Military District of the JNA, which is the abbreviation for the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). The headquarters of this military district was situated in Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During this time, the region was embroiled in the chaos of the Yugoslav Wars, a series of ethnic conflicts, wars of independence, and insurgencies that took place in the former Yugoslavia from 1991 to 2001. The wars were characterized by bitter fighting, massacres, and systematic rape, primarily perpetrated by Serb forces against Bosniak and Croat civilians. As the commander of the Second Military District of the JNA, the individual would have been responsible for a range of military activities and operations in the region, including troop movements, strategic planning and coordination, and the execution of military actions against enemy forces. Although the JNA was initially portrayed as a neutral peacekeeping force, it later became apparent that they were providing support and resources to Serb nationalist forces. The city of Sarajevo itself became a focal point of the conflict, as it was besieged by Serb forces from April 1992 to February 1996, during the Siege of Sarajevo. This was the longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 10,000-14,000 people, the majority of whom were civilians. Thus, taking command of the JNA's Second Military District in Sarajevo during April 1992 placed the individual at the center of a complex and brutal conflict, tasked with navigating the numerous military and political challenges posed by the ongoing Yugoslav Wars."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - article - adjective - interjection - conjunction - pronoun The rationale to choose \\"conjunction\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"The correct answer to the question is \\"conjunction.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"conjunction\\" is that conjunctions are used to connect or join words, phrases, clauses, or sentences in the English language. They help create more complex and meaningful statements by linking various linguistic elements together. Unlike articles, adjectives, interjections, and pronouns, which have different functions in a sentence, conjunctions specifically serve the purpose of connecting two or more elements. There are two main types of conjunctions: 1. Coordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions link equal grammatical elements together, such as two independent clauses, noun phrases, or verb phrases. Some common coordinating conjunctions include \\"and,\\" \\"but,\\" \\"or,\\" \\"nor,\\" \\"for,\\" \\"so,\\" and \\"yet.\\" Example: Sarah likes to read novels, and her sister enjoys watching movies. 2. Subordinating conjunctions: These conjunctions connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, establishing a relationship between them that indicates time, cause, or comparison. Common subordinating conjunctions include \\"because,\\" \\"although,\\" \\"since,\\" \\"if,\\" and \\"when.\\" Example: Although the weather was cold, she decided to go for a walk.

In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty., The Portinari Altarpiece or Portinari Triptych ( c. 1475 ) is an oil on wood triptych painting by the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes representing the Adoration of the Shepherds . It measures 253 x 304 cm , and is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence , Italy ., The Adoration of the Shepherds, in the Nativity of Jesus in art, is a scene in which shepherds are near witnesses to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, arriving soon after the actual birth. It is often combined in art with the Adoration of the Magi, in which case it is typically just referred to by the latter title. The Annunciation to the Shepherds, when they are summoned by an angel to the scene, is a distinct subject., Hans Memling (also spelled Memlinc; c. 1430 11 August 1494) was a German painter who moved to Flanders and worked in the tradition of Early Netherlandish painting. He spent some time in the Brussels workshop of Rogier van der Weyden, and after van der Weyden's death in 1464, Memling was made a citizen of Bruges, where he became one of the leading artists, painting both portraits and diptychs for personal devotion and several large religious works, continuing the style he learned in his youth., Jan van Eyck (before c. 1390 9 July 1441) was a Flemish/Netherlandish painter active in Bruges. He is often considered one of the founders of Early Netherlandish painting school and one of the most significant representatives of Northern Renaissance art. The few surviving records of his early life indicate that he was born c. 13801390, most likely in Maaseik. He took employment in the Hague as painter and \\"Valet de chambre\\" with John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland and Hainaut in the Hague around 1422, when he was already a master painter with workshop assistants. After John's death in 1425 he was employed in Lille as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, until 1429 before moving to Bruges, where he lived until his death. He was highly regarded by Philip, and undertook a number of diplomatic visits abroad, including to Lisbon in 1428 to explore the possibility of a marriage contract between the duke and Isabella of Portugal., Hugo van der Goes (probably Ghent c. 1430/1440 Auderghem 1482) was one of the most important Flemish painters of the late 15th century, along with Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Dieric Bouts. He introduced important innovations such as a new monumentalism, a specific colour spectrum and an individualistic manner of portraiture. The presence of his masterpiece, the Portinari Triptych in Florence, from the late-15th century onwards played a role in the development of realism in Italian Renaissance art., Subject: portinari altarpiece, Relation: movement, Options: (A) early netherlandish painting (B) northern renaissance (C) realism (D) renaissance art (E) zoroastrianism","completion":"Based on the context and the relation \\"movement,\\" the object entity that has the given relation with the subject \\"Portinari Altarpiece\\" is (A) Early Netherlandish painting."},{"prompt":"Question: when did lucy stone died?

Question: Information: - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana is a unitary presidential constitutional democracy, located along the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean, in the subregion of West Africa.

It is one of the oldest administrative districts in Ghana. - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments.

They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What other countries did the Bush administration have to deal with other than al Qaeda?\\" is \\"Germany\\"?","completion":"According to the above paragraph, the statement \\"the correct answer to the question 'What other countries did the Bush administration have to deal with other than al Qaeda?' is 'Germany'?\\" is incorrect. The paragraph does not mention Germany as a country the Bush administration had to deal with. Instead, it highlights various issues and countries the administration focused on, which include: 1. The collapse of the Middle East peace process: This indicates that countries involved in the Middle East peace process, such as Israel and Palestine, were among the administration's concerns. 2. The crisis over a U.S. spy plane in Chinese territory: This event shows that China was another country the Bush administration dealt with during its first months. 3. A heavy focus on Russia: The administration worked on a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, which involved dealings with Russia. 4. Europe: Although specific European countries are not mentioned in the paragraph, the administration's attention to Europe as a whole is noted. 5. Mexico: The paragraph mentions that the administration was engaged with Mexico during its early months in office. 6. The Persian Gulf: This again refers to a region rather than a specific country, but it implies that the countries situated around the Persian Gulf were on the administration's radar. Thus, the countries and regions the Bush administration had to deal with other than Al Qaeda, as mentioned in the paragraph, are Israel, Palestine, China, Russia, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf region.

Jess chose to use wallpaper and not paint for the walls because the Pick from: A. wallpaper was dull.; B. paint was dull.;","completion":"B. paint was dull. Jess had always been somebody who appreciated the little details in life. It wasn't just about making a statement or catching the eye – no, Jess loved the nuance and depth that unique designs could bring to the table. That's why, when the time came to redecorate her home, she chose to use wallpaper instead of paint. After all, the paint seemed so dull compared to the intricate patterns and rich textures offered by the wallpaper. As the days inched closer to her renovation project's start, Jess excitedly scanned through endless catalogs and websites, trying to find the perfect wallpaper design that would breathe new life into her home. The decision wasn't easy, as there were so many beautiful and tantalizing options in front of her – bold floral patterns, delicate damasks, whimsical illustrations, and mesmerizing geometric designs. Jess spent countless hours poring over her selections, debating whether to choose something subtle and understated, or something more daring and eye-catching. At night, she would imagine transforming her dull, paint-filled rooms into veritable masterpieces of intricate design. Ultimately, her heart settled on a stunning teal wallpaper with metallic gold accents. The interwoven pattern reminded her of the swirling beauty of Gustav Klimt’s paintings – and she knew it would be the perfect backdrop for her personal sanctuary. Once the wallpaper arrived, Jess couldn't wait to start the installation process. She contacted a well-regarded wallpaper installer in her area and scheduled a date for the project to begin. The anticipation and excitement built up inside her like a tidal wave, as her once-boring walls were soon to be completely transformed. The installation process was nothing short of magical. With each strip of wallpaper being carefully applied, Jess could see the room's personality slowly emerge from its once featureless surface. She marveled at the metallic accents as they seemed to dance and shimmer, delighting in the way they played with the light streaming through the windows. Even the shade of teal appeared richer and more luxurious than she could have ever imagined, and she knew without a doubt that she had made the right choice. As Jess admired the newly-wallpapered room, a sense of satisfaction washed over her. She knew that her decision to forego the dull paint in favor of this eye-catching wallpaper had turned her home into the sanctuary she always dreamed it would be. The room truly felt like her personal domain, an extension and reflection of her unique style and taste. However, beyond the physical beauty of the wallpaper, Jess felt a deeper sense of accomplishment. In choosing a design that resonated with her heart and spirit, she had fostered a connection between her personal aesthetic and the space she inhabited. Every time she looked at those patterned walls, they reminded her of the importance of following her instincts and staying true to her passion. With her home now a piece of art in its own right, Jess embraced the thrill of leaving dull paint behind and continuing her journey of self-expression. She eagerly anticipated more opportunities to showcase her creativity and personal style in other aspects of her life, inspired by the boldness and beauty that surrounded her. The wallpaper had done more than just transform her living space – it had sparked a newfound confidence in Jess, empowering her to embrace her uniqueness and share it with the world. And, with each passing day, she grew more and more grateful that she had chosen wallpaper over paint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The information you possess is the foundation for implementing any strategy or undertaking any project. To help inspire you to make effective decisions on prioritizing your initiatives, here are some key aspects to consider when targeting initiatives based on knowledge. 1. Understand your goals and objectives: Be clear on your goals and objectives, both short-term and long-term. This will help in narrowing down the initiatives to be taken up and identifying the priority areas that will help in achieving the desired outcomes. 2. Identify your core competencies and areas of expertise: Your core competencies are the unique strengths and skills that distinguish you from your competitors. Identifying these strengths will help you to focus on those initiatives that align with your expertise and where you have a competitive edge. 3. Prioritize initiatives based on potential impact: Evaluate the potential impact of each initiative on your overall objectives, and prioritize them accordingly. This step is critical in ensuring that the most valuable initiatives are being targeted and allocated the necessary resources. 4. Allocate resources effectively: After prioritizing initiatives, allocate resources such as time, workforce, and budget optimally to achieve the maximum impact on your goals and objectives. Proper allocation of resources will ensure that your initiatives are effectively executed and your time isn't wasted on low-impact projects. 5. Keep learning and updating your knowledge base: To make informed decisions, stay abreast of industry trends, and continuously update your knowledge. Attend conferences, webinars, and read industry reports to stay on top of new developments and innovations in your field. This knowledge will be crucial for making sound decisions and staying ahead of the competition. 6. Foster a knowledge-sharing culture: Encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing within your team or organization. This will help generate a more extensive knowledge base, enabling more informed decision-making on prioritizing initiatives. 7. Monitor progress and reassess priorities: Regularly monitor and evaluate the progress of your initiatives to ensure they are on track to meet your objectives. If an initiative is not producing the desired results, do not hesitate to modify or even terminate it. Moreover, stay open to re-evaluating priorities as new information becomes available. 8. Be open to innovation: Be open to exploring new ideas and techniques for executing your initiatives. This will help keep your approach fresh and increase the chances of success. In conclusion, prioritizing and targeting initiatives based on knowledge is crucial for the success of any individual or organization. By considering the factors outlined above, one can make well-informed decisions to focus on critical initiatives that will ultimately lead to the achievement of their goals and objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There is a man. 2. He is by himself (which implies he is alone). 3. He is sleeping. 4. He is at a table. 5. There are 3 empty chairs at the table. Now, let's break down the second sentence, \\"A man sleeping alone at a table\\": 1. There is a man. 2. He is sleeping. 3. He is alone. 4. He is at a table. By comparing the two sentences, we can see that the second sentence captures the essence of the first sentence while omitting certain unessential details (namely, the number of empty chairs).

Answer the following question given this paragraph: USDA, photo by Scott Bauer. Deer ticks are the vectors for Lyme disease . public domain. Q: Deer ticks are the vectors for what disease that affects humans? A: The answer is:","completion":"Lyme disease. Deer ticks, scientifically known as Ixodes scapularis, are the primary carriers or vectors of Lyme disease, a bacterial infection that affects humans. The paragraph provided by USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) and accompanied by a photo taken by Scott Bauer, clearly states that deer ticks are the vectors for Lyme disease. This information appears within the public domain, making it accessible and reliable for general use. Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks, commonly known as deer ticks. These ticks are usually found in wooded and grassy areas where they inhabit and feed on various mammals, particularly white-tailed deer, hence the name deer ticks. When a tick bites an infected animal, it ingests the bacteria and subsequently becomes a vector for disease transmission. Humans can contract Lyme disease when bitten by an infected deer tick. The tick must be attached to the human skin for at least 36 to 48 hours for the bacteria to be transmitted and cause infection. Early symptoms of Lyme disease include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. In some cases, a circular rash called erythema migrans or a \\"bull's-eye\\" rash may develop at the site of the tick bite, typically within one week of exposure. If left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to more severe symptoms and complications, such as facial palsy, arthritis, numbness or weakness in the limbs, and impaired muscle movement. In some cases, it may also cause heart palpitations, dizziness, and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics are essential, as they can help prevent the development of severe symptoms and potential long-term health issues. In conclusion, deer ticks are the primary vectors responsible for the transmission of Lyme disease in humans. This infection can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, that may result in long-term health complications if not addressed appropriately. Awareness, prevention measures, and early treatment are crucial in managing the risks associated with Lyme disease."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Who was born first, Ivo Andrić or Peter Ackroyd?

First, we need our color palette. We're going to need the colors brown and red. Imagine them like chocolate and strawberry ice cream flavors. 2. Now, let's talk about the shield. Imagine it as a big cookie. The outside part of the cookie that you see, we call that the \\"outer layer\\". This is where we'll use our chocolate color (brown) paint. Grab a nice, big paintbrush, dip it in the brown color and paint the outer layer of the shield just like you would frost a cookie. 3. Once you're done with that, we'll move to the inside of the shield. There's a neat design there, something like a swirl - think of a cinnamon roll. We're going to use our strawberry flavor (red). For this, we will need a smaller paintbrush because it's a small area we're painting. Paint the inside swirl with red color, just like adding a nice swirl of strawberry sauce on your cinnamon roll. 4. After we're done painting, we have to let the paint dry. Think of it like waiting for the cookie to bake. Give it some time and voila! We have a beautifully painted, realistic shield! Remember, creativity is like magic but it needs a bit of patience.

During their escape, they find themselves on an airfield, where they hide the rocket pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy, trapped by several Valentine mobsters, learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum.[Note 1] At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent, and Jenny knocks him out.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who sends emissaries to movie producers? Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film. Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screen writers, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh. The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson whom he's had a crush on since they first met. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution.

SAN FRANCISCO — The new iPhone that Apple unveiled on Wednesday does not have the biggest screen of any smartphone on the market, nor is it the first to offer Internet access over the latest, speediest wireless networks. Apple executives say that does not matter. They care more about building the best phone, they say, and combining technologies into the most attractive package, not being first with the latest bells and whistles. “I feel the need to be the best,” said Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, in a conversation after the event announcing the new device, the iPhone 5. “We don’t view our products as a checklist of features,” he added. The new iPhone has a larger, four-inch screen, faster wireless Internet speeds and a more powerful chip than the previous version of the company’s smartphone. It is 18 percent thinner and 20 percent lighter. This is the first time Apple has altered the dimensions of the iPhone’s display, which has measured 3.5 inches diagonally since the original iPhone was released in 2007. While the display at that time seemed gigantic compared with the tiny screens on most cellphones, Apple’s competitors have been far more aggressive in pushing bigger displays on their smartphones, with some screens approaching five inches. Apple said the new display offered a bigger canvas for activities like reading books, browsing Web sites and watching movies. The device will also work on the latest variety of high-speed data network with wireless carriers, known as LTE, which other companies have included in their products for some time. Even though the product is not as startling as the original iPhone — the likes of which had not been seen before in the electronics industry — analysts still expect the iPhone 5 to be a hot seller this holiday season. Investors seemed to agree, sending Apple’s shares up 9.20, or 1.4 percent, to close at 669.79 after the event. The device, which will go on sale on Sept. 21, will start at 199 with a two-year wireless contract, a price similar to that of previous versions. In what could be one of Apple’s more vexing moves with a new product, though, the company got rid of the traditional 30-pin dock connector for attaching the iPhone to power cables, stereo docking stations and other peripherals, replacing it with a smaller connector it calls Lightning. The change means owners of existing iPhone accessories will have to buy an adapter from Apple so they can plug the new phone into those devices. The adapters are on sale at the Apple store for 30 for one version and 40 for another. Apple said it made the change because the new connector was more durable, freed space for other technologies inside the iPhone and enabled the iPhone 5’s thinner design. The company said many of the functions of traditional iPhone cables, other than charging, were now handled by wireless connections like Bluetooth. In a brief interview after the event, Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said the company was offering the adapter to try to make the shift to the new technology as painless as possible for its users. “At some point you have to move to the next generation,” he said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, said the iPhone 5 showed how Apple approaches new technologies cautiously until it is sure it can deliver the best experience possible. The first phones that supported LTE, for example, were often criticized for poor battery life, but Apple waited until it could offer a product that could hold a charge long enough, he said. In the new product, Apple also chose not to support near-field communication wireless technology, which can be used to make wireless payments but has been slow to take off. Mr. Cook said the four-inch display was the perfect size because it could be easily held in one hand. Apple made the screen taller, but not wider, than the previous generation of iPhone for that very reason, he said.

London (CNN)A UK public inquiry into the 2006 death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko opened Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after years of wrangling over what evidence can be heard. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering his poisoning by tea at a London hotel. The Kremlin has always strongly denied the accusation. Sir Robert Owen, who's chairman of the inquiry, said Tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors. The British government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry, but the decision was reversed last summer after Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, challenged it in court. She argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. An inquest -- a coroner-led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in England -- had been opened after her husband's death. But unlike a public inquiry, it cannot hear evidence behind closed doors. In Alexander Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security. \\"The issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern,\\" Owen said. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital on November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. UK prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, from Russia in connection with Litvinenko's murder. But Moscow has refused, saying Russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of Russian citizens. Both men deny involvement in Litvinenko's death. Owen said that Lugovoi and Kovtun had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from Russia and that he hoped they would do so. The public inquiry will look at possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death. However, it will not address the question as to whether the UK government could, or should, have taken steps to prevent the murder. Litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a British agent, with a handler at MI6, Britain's foreign security service. In 2012, the counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said evidence provided by the UK government showed Russian involvement and \\"does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko.\\" The inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held. Owen, the coroner in the inquest, said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before Easter; that is, early April. More than 70 witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks, including family and friends of Litvinenko, those who worked with him before his death, medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy, the court heard. The pathologists will testify Wednesday on the postmortem results. The presence of radiation in Litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy, the inquiry heard. A nuclear scientist will also give evidence Wednesday about polonium-210, its qualities, where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once ingested. In the course of the inquiry, evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material. Owen said polonium could have been used to \\"kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1. A long-awaited public inquiry into the death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko began in London. Litvinenko blamed Russian President Putin for his death by poisoning in 2006. 2. The inquiry will review sensitive material about potential Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death, some of which will be heard behind closed doors. 3. Litvinenko's widow, Marina, successfully argued in court for a public inquiry, allowing for a more thorough investigation than an inquest could provide. 4. UK prosecutors have requested the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun from Russia in relation to the murder. Russia declined, citing constitutional restrictions on extraditing Russian citizens. Both men deny involvement. 5. Hugh Davies, counsel to the inquest, stated in 2012 that there is a prima facie case of Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death. 6. The inquiry will conclude before Easter with testimonies from over 70 witnesses, including family, friends, colleagues, medical staff and pathologists. 7. A nuclear scientist will provide evidence about polonium-210, the radioactive poison that killed Litvinenko, and its effects on the human body. 8. Evidence will be considered regarding the public risk posed by such a highly radioactive material.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Your living room Feng shui is all about balance. Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things. Take a look at every object, and ask yourself, \\"Do I really need it? Do I really like it?\\" If the answer is no, get rid of it. Your bedroom You should have the head of your bed placed against a wall, as this gives you a sense of security. Avoid having a bed under a window, as you are exposed to danger and bad energy from outside. If this is impossible, use blinds or heavy curtains to cover the window. Never sleep in a place where you can't see the door--you should always be able to see someone who's coming in. Avoid hanging pictures or lights above your bed, as this leads to a subconscious feeling of threat. Don't put mirrors opposite the bed either, as they \\"break up\\" the image, and therefore the relationship reflected in them. Keep lighting low and soft, and decorate...

These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. - The Milwaukee Road 's class F7 comprised six ( # 100 -- # 105 ) high - speed , streamlined 4 - 6 - 4 \`\` Baltic '' or \`\` Hudson '' type steam locomotives built by Alco in 1937 -- 38 to haul the Milwaukee 's Hiawatha express passenger trains . Following on from the success of the road 's class A 4 - 4 - 2s , the F7s allowed the road to haul heavier trains on the popular Chicago -- Twin Cities routes . The F7s are major contenders for the fastest steam locomotives ever built , as they ran at over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) daily . One run in January 1941 recorded by a reporter for Trains magazine saw 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) achieved twice -- in the midst of a heavy snowstorm . Baron Gérard Vuillet , a French railroading expert , once recorded a run between Chicago and Milwaukee where the locomotive reached 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) and sustained an average 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) for 4.5 miles ( 7.2 km ) . However , the British locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is officially accepted to be the world 's fastest , with a run recorded at 125.88 mph ( 202.58 km / h ) in 1938 . The Milwaukee F7s are accepted as the fastest steam locomotives by a different measure -- scheduled speed between stations . In 1939 , shortly after they were introduced into passenger service , the Twin Cities Hiawatha schedule was modified such that the engines would need to run the 78.3 mi ( 126.0 km ) between Portage and Sparta , Wisconsin in 58 minutes -- a start - to - stop average of 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) . First - built # 100 was also the first withdrawn from service , on November 10 , 1949 ; last - built # 105 was the final one in service , withdrawn August 10 , 1951 . All were scrapped . - On a steam locomotive, a driving wheel is a powered wheel which is driven by the locomotive's pistons (or turbine, in the case of a steam turbine locomotive). On a conventional, non-articulated locomotive, the driving wheels are all coupled together with side rods (also known as coupling rods); normally one pair is directly driven by the main rod (or connecting rod) which is connected to the end of the piston rod; power is transmitted to the others through the side rods. - Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, six powered and coupled driving wheels and four trailing wheels. In France, where the type was first used, it is known as the Baltic, while it became known as the Hudson in most of North America. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'milwaukee road class f7' with the relationship of 'powerplant'.

A weak entity is a type of entity in a relational database that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone and relies on a foreign key relationship with another (strong) entity to obtain its primary key. It is called weak because of its dependency on a strong entity for its existence. Question2, on the other hand, is focused on comparing strong and weak entity sets in DBMS. A strong entity set is a set of entities that can be uniquely identified by their primary key attributes without relying on a relationship with another entity set. In contrast, weak entity sets are those that need a foreign key in addition to their partial key attributes to uniquely identify their entities, due to their relationship with a strong entity set."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Lewis Henry Morgan (November 21, 1818 - December 17, 1881) was a pioneering American anthropologist and social theorist who worked as a railroad lawyer. He is best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of social evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds societies together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic institution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family. Also interested in what leads to social change, he was a contemporary of the European social theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were influenced by reading his work on social structure and material culture, the influence of technology on progress. After graduating in 1840, Morgan returned to Aurora to read the law with an established firm. In 1842 he was admitted to the bar in Rochester, where he went into partnership with a Union classmate, George F. Danforth, a future judge. They could find no clients, as the nation was in an economic depression, which had started with the Panic of 1837. Morgan wrote essays, which he had begun to do while studying law, and published some in The Knickerbocker under the pen name Aquarius. On January 1, 1841, Morgan and some friends from Cayuga Academy formed a secret fraternal society which they called the Gordian Knot. As Morgan's earliest essays from that time had classical themes, the club may have been a kind of literary society, as was common then. In 1841 or 1842 the young men redefined the society, renaming it the Order of the Iroquois. Morgan referred to this event as cutting the knot. In 1843 they named it the Grand Order of the Iroquois, followed by the New Confederacy of the Iroquois. They made the group a research organization to collect information on the Iroquois, whose historical territory for centuries had included central and upstate New York west of the Hudson and the Finger Lakes region. The men intended to resurrect the spirit of the Iroquois. They tried to learn the languages, assumed Iroquois names, and organized the group by the historic pattern of Iroquois tribes. In 1844 they received permission from the former Freemasons of Aurora to use the upper floor of the Masonic temple as a meeting hall. New members underwent a secret rite called inindianation in which they were transformed spiritually into Iroquois. They met in the summer around campfires and paraded yearly through the town in costume. Morgan seemed infused with the spirit of the Iroquois. He said, \\"We are now upon the very soil over which they exercised dominion ... Poetry still lingers around the scenery....\\" These new Iroquois retained a literary frame of mind, but they intended to focus on \\"the writing of a native American epic that would define national identity\\". Who else was involved in this project?","completion":"In the project of forming a secret fraternal society called the Gordian Knot, which later became the Order of the Iroquois, Lewis Henry Morgan was joined by his friends from Cayuga Academy."},{"prompt":"Title: Fantastic Work-out in very short time Review: This is a great workout dvd.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Gaelic Ireland was involved in trade with Britain and mainland Europe from ancient times, and this trade increased over the centuries. Tacitus, for example, wrote in the 1st century that most of Ireland's harbours were known to the Romans through commerce. There are many passages in early Irish literature that mention luxury items imported from foreign lands, and the fair of Carman in Leinster included a market of foreign traders. In the Middle Ages the main exports were textiles such as wool and linen while the main imports were luxury items. Money was seldom used in Gaelic society; instead, goods and services were usually exchanged for other goods and services. The economy was mainly a pastoral one, based on livestock (cows, sheep, pigs, goats, etc.) and their products. Cattle was \\"the main element in the Irish pastoral economy\\" and the main form of wealth, providing milk, butter, cheese, meat, fat, hides, and so forth. They were a \\"highly mobile form of wealth and economic resource which could be quickly and easily moved to a safer locality in time of war or trouble\\". The nobility owned great herds of cattle that had herdsmen and guards. Sheep, goats and pigs were also a valuable resource but had a lesser role in Irish pastoralism. Horticulture was practised; the main crops being oats, wheat and barley, although flax was also grown for making linen. Transhumance was also practised, whereby people moved with their livestock to higher pastures in summer and back to lower pastures in the cooler months. The summer pasture was called the buaile (anglicized as booley) and it is noteworthy that the Irish word for boy (buachaill) originally meant a herdsman. Many moorland areas were \\"shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony\\".","completion":"This text is about Gaelic Ireland (Eire Ghaidhealach), an entity that encompasses the Gaelic political, social order, culture, and way of life that existed in Ireland from prehistoric times until the early 17th century.

Answer the question...who was the first whig president of the united states??","completion":"The first Whig president of the United States was William Henry Harrison, who was elected as the ninth U.S. president in 1840. Born on February 9, 1773, in Virginia, Harrison came from a prominent political family. His father, Benjamin Harrison, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his grandfather, also named Benjamin Harrison, was the Governor of Virginia. Before becoming the president, William Henry Harrison had a lengthy career in public service. He started as a soldier, joining the U.S. Army in 1791, where he saw action in several notable battles, including the Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812. Harrison became a national hero for his leadership at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, where his forces defeated an Indian confederation led by the Shawnee chief Tecumseh. The popular slogan \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\\" would later be associated with his presidential campaign. After his military service, Harrison held various political positions, including serving as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for the Northwest Territory and later as the Governor of the Indiana Territory. From 1816 to 1819, he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for the state of Ohio. Harrison was also a U.S. Senator from Ohio from 1825 to 1828, and he briefly served as the U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1828 to 1829. William Henry Harrison was the Whig Party's candidate in the 1836 election, but he lost to Democrat Martin Van Buren. However, in the 1840 election, Harrison, along with his running mate John Tyler, secured a victory as the first Whig president and vice president of the United States. Harrison's successful campaign focused on his military prowess, and he promoted a \\"log cabin and hard cider\\" image to appeal to everyday Americans as a man of the people. Unfortunately, William Henry Harrison's presidency was short-lived. On March 4, 1841, he delivered the longest inaugural address in U.S. history in a cold, wet weather without wearing a coat. As a result, Harrison contracted pneumonia, an illness that ultimately led to his death on April 4, 1841, just one month into his presidential term. His passing marked the first time a U.S. president died in office and led to Vice President John Tyler becoming the 10th President of the United States. Despite Harrison's brief time in office, his election as the first Whig president laid the foundation for future Whig presidents, such as Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore, who were elected in the 1840s and early 1850s."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can do this by adding 2286*y to both sides of the equation: 2286*y + 49 = -2286*y + 2293*y + 2286*y This gives us: 2286*y + 49 = 2293*y Now, we want to get all the \\"y\\" terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do this, we'll subtract 2286*y from both sides: 2286*y - 2286*y + 49 = 2293*y - 2286*y This gives us: 49 = 7*y Next, we want to find out what one \\"y\\" is, so we'll divide both sides by 7: 49 ÷ 7 = 7*y ÷ 7 That gives us: 7 = y So, the value of \\"y\\" that makes this equation true is 7.

He noted that as case B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: A:","completion":"Given the information provided, case C (Jupiter) would see slower movement than case A (Mars).

His work helped inspire the creation of the personal computer and the Internet. Artificial Intelligence Before Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \\"Artificial Intelligence\\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \\"artificial neural network\\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on. Robotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality How many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research. Minsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment. Minsky's major prediction that computers will one day become as intelligent as humans is now called the Theory of Singularity. Which is NOT one of Minsky's characteristics according to the passage?

Cut the bread in half horizontally. If the bread is too long for the cookie sheet, cut each end of the bread to be able to fit in the sheet.","completion":"After preparing your bread, it's time to move on to preparing the garlic butter mixture. Start by peeling and mincing around 3-4 cloves of garlic. In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic with 1 cup (2 sticks) of room temperature unsalted butter. The butter needs to be at room temperature to ensure it combines evenly with the garlic. You can also microwave the butter for a few seconds to soften it if it's still too hard. Now, add in some chopped fresh parsley. About 1/4 cup should do, but you can adjust to your personal preference. You may also include herbs like oregano or basil for a bit of extra flavor. Season this mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Mix the ingredients together until they are well-incorporated. You should end up with a smooth, slightly fluffy garlic butter. Spread this butter mixture evenly on the cut sides of the bread. Make sure to cover all areas, even the corners. This will ensure every bite is full of the rich, garlicky flavor. Once the bread is slathered with your garlic butter mixture, it's time to add the cheese. Grate approximately 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, but feel free to play around with what cheeses you want! You can even use a mix of different cheeses like cheddar, Monterrey Jack, or even some Parmesan if you're feeling fancy. Sprinkle the cheese generously over the bread, ensuring it's covered evenly. This will help to make sure that every piece of bread has a generous amount of cheese. Place the bread on your previously prepared baking sheet and put it in the oven. Bake for around 10-15 minutes, or until the edges of the bread are golden and crispy and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned. After taking it from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes. Cutting into it too soon may result in the cheese pulling away. Want a bit of extra garlicky kick? Sprinkle some garlic powder over the top right when it comes out of the oven. Once cooled slightly, cut the bread into serving size pieces. You can cut it into large chunks, or slimmer slices - whichever you and your guests prefer. There you have it - cheesy garlic bread homemade from scratch! Best enjoyed warm, alongside your favorite pasta dish or just as a snack on its own. It's the perfect blend of crisp, chewy bread, creamy, melty cheese, and that savory garlic butter that makes this a true comfort food classic. Remember, you can always jazz up your recipe with other ingredients you love. Some people love adding a bit of crispy bacon or some jalapenos for a spicy kick. The beauty of homemade cheesy garlic bread is that you can modify it to suit your taste perfectly! Enjoy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly.

Build up to jogging with regular walks. Warm up for 5-10 minutes before you jog. Alternate between jogging and walking when you start. Practice proper form while jogging. Breathe regularly as you jog. Stay hydrated while you run. Cool down after you jog with walking and light stretches.","completion":"Title: Enhance Your Jogging Experience: From Preparation to Cool Down Introduction Jogging is a popular and accessible cardiovascular exercise that offers numerous health benefits, including weight management, improved cardiovascular health, and increased stamina. To achieve the best results and minimize the risk of injury, it's crucial to properly prepare, maintain good form during the exercise, and recover adequately. In this article, we will discuss ways to fuel your body, build up to jogging, warm-up and cool-down strategies, and maintaining proper jogging form. 1. Fuel Your Body with a Protein-Rich Meal The nutrients we consume before physical activity can have a significant impact on our performance. Consuming a protein-rich meal 2-4 hours before jogging provides the body with essential amino acids required for muscle recovery and growth. It also helps prevent muscle soreness and fatigue. Some examples of protein-rich meals include grilled chicken or fish, yogurt with nuts and berries, or even a protein smoothie. Combining these proteins with carbohydrates will help supply your muscles with energy throughout your jog. 2. Gradual Transition to Jogging Before diving into jogging, it's essential to build your endurance and physical preparedness through regular walks. Walking helps condition your muscles, joints, and cardiovascular system for the more demanding intensity of jogging. Start with brisk walks and gradually increase your pace over time until you feel comfortable transitioning to jogging. 3. Warm-Up Before You Jog Warming up for 5-10 minutes before jogging is crucial to avoid injury and improve performance. This can include light aerobic exercises, such as jumping jacks or high knees, to increase your heart rate and blood flow to the muscles. Follow this with dynamic stretches targeting major muscle groups, such as leg swings, arm circles, and hip circles. 4. Alternate Between Jogging and Walking When starting out with jogging, it is recommended to alternate between jogging and walking to avoid overexertion and prevent injuries. This strategy can help build endurance and adapt your body to the physical demands of jogging. Gradually increase the jogging intervals while reducing walking intervals until you can sustain jogging for your desired duration. 5. Practice Proper Jogging Form Maintain an upright posture with a slight forward lean while jogging. Keep your head up, shoulders relaxed, and swing your arms at a 90-degree angle to maintain momentum. Land on the midfoot or forefoot instead of the heel, rolling forward onto the toes with each step. Proper jogging form can minimize the risk of injury and improve running efficiency. 6. Breathe Regularly Breathing rhythmically helps supply your muscles with ample oxygen to maintain performance. Maintain a consistent breathing pattern by inhaling for 2-3 steps and exhaling for 2-3 steps. Deep, controlled breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth can also help prevent side stitches and cramps. 7. Stay Hydrated Hydration is vital to your overall performance, especially during cardiovascular exercises like jogging. Sip water before, during, and after your jog to help regulate your body temperature, lubricate joints, and prevent dehydration. Avoid sugary sports drinks unless you are running for more than an hour, in which case you might need electrolyte replacement. 8. Cool Down After Jogging After finishing your jog, it's important to cool down and gradually return to your resting heart rate. Walk for 5-10 minutes, followed by static stretches targeting your major muscle groups, such as quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. Cooling down helps prevent injury, aids muscle recovery, and improves flexibility. Conclusion To get the most out of your jogging experience and minimize the risk of injury, it's important to follow the recommended steps for preparation, proper form, and recovery. Incorporate a protein-rich meal, gradual transitions, warm-ups, walking intervals, hydration, and cool-down strategies into your jogging routine and experience the benefits of this accessible, effective exercise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the first day of the Test match, England's captain, Alastair Cook, won the toss and decided to send India in to bat. This strategic decision paid off as Anderson, known for his exceptional bowling skills, wreaked havoc on the Indian batting lineup. Anderson's top-notch performance broke several records, including passing Fred Trueman as the highest Test wicket-taker in England and beating Ian Botham's mark to claim the most Test wickets at Lord's. Despite the impactful bowling by Anderson, India found a hero in Ajinkya Rahane, who scored a brilliant century that put India's total at a respectable position. Rahane managed to stay focused and resilient in the face of England's relentless bowling attack, ultimately reaching 103 before being dismissed by Anderson late in the day. Rahane and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (36) put up a strong show for the eighth-wicket partnership, contributing 90 runs before Kumar's dismissal. Their valiant effort provided a much-needed boost to the Indian team, giving them momentum as the match continued. Other notable performances included Stuart Broad taking two wickets and Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes claiming one wicket each. The combined efforts of the England bowlers helped maintain the pressure on India throughout the day, keeping the match closely contested. As the match continues, fans from both sides eagerly await more captivating performances from these skilled cricketers. The Test match at Lord's serves as a showcase of exceptional talent, and it remains to be seen which side will emerge victorious in this thrilling encounter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","completion":"In the Bible, the son of Cush and grandson of Ham who is described as 'a mighty hunter before the Lord' is Nimrod. Nimrod is a prominent figure in Genesis 10, which is a part of the Table of Nations, a list that details the descendants of Noah and their respective nations following the Great Flood. Nimrod is particularly notable for being remembered as a great leader, a mighty warrior, and a skilled hunter. The specific verse that refers to Nimrod as a mighty hunter before God is found in Genesis 10:8-9: \\"Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, 'Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.'\\" Although Nimrod's other accomplishments are not detailed extensively in the Bible, his legacy has had a lasting impact on the world, as his name became synonymous with impressive feats and accomplishments. Furthermore, his status as a skilled hunter extended beyond the biblical context and was adopted by later writers and cultures, who recognized him for his prowess and leadership skills. Nimrod is also recognized for his role in the establishment of several ancient cities. The first of these was Babel (later known as Babylon), the location of the infamous Tower of Babel, as well as other important cities in the region, including Erech, Akkad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar. He is also credited with building the great cities of Assyria, including Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, and Resen. Despite his accomplishments, over time Nimrod became associated with tyranny and oppression, which has led to mixed views on his character. Some view him as a heroic persona—a brilliant strategist, leader, and hunter—while others consider him a tyrant, a power-hungry despot who sought to dominate others and make a name for himself. The story of Nimrod, ultimately, serves as a reminder of the complexities and contradictions that can be found in human character, and how one man's legacy can shift and evolve through the lens of time and perspective."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grade was born in Tokmak, Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire to Isaak and Olga Winogradsky. In 1912, when Grade was six, the Jewish family emigrated to escape Cossack violence and anti-Semitism, from Odessa via Berlin to Brick Lane in Bethnal Green in the East End of London. Isaak worked as a trouser-presser while his three sons (Grade and his younger brothers, Bernard (later Bernard Delfont) and Leslie) attended the Rochelle Street Elementary School near Shoreditch, where Yiddish was spoken by 90% of the pupils. For two years the Winogradskys lived in rented rooms at the north end of Brick Lane, before moving to the nearby Boundary Estate. At the age of 15, Grade became an agent for a clothing company, and shortly afterwards started his own business. In 1926, he was declared Charleston Champion of the World at a dancing competition at the Royal Albert Hall. Fred Astaire was one of the judges. Grade subsequently became a professional dancer going by the name Louis Grad; this form came from a Paris reporter's typing error that Grade liked and decided to keep. Decades later, the then octogenarian Lord Grade once danced the Charleston at a party Arthur Ochs Sulzberger gave in New York. Signed as a dancer by Joe Collins (father of Jackie and Joan Collins) in 1931, around 1934, Grade went into partnership with him and became a talent agent in their company Collins & Grade. Among their earliest clients were the harmonica player Larry Adler and the jazz group Quintet of the Hot Club of France. Following the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, Grade became involved in arranging entertainment for soldiers in Harrogate, and later joined the British Army. He was discharged after two years when an old problem with swelling of the knees, which had earlier ended his dancing career, recurred. In 1945, the arrangement with Collins having been terminated, Grade formed a partnership with his brother Leslie (Lew and Leslie Grade Ltd., or the Grade Organisation). That year, the brothers traveled in the United States, where they developed their entertainment interests. His connections included, among others, Bob Hope and Judy Garland, who performed in Britain for the first time. The brothers became the main bookers of artists for the London Palladium in 1948, then managed by Val Parnell for the Moss Empires Group owned by the family of Prince Littler.

Information: - The Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer, in Poland the Volkswagen Garbus and in the U.S. the Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003. - The Love Bug (sometimes referred to as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American comedy film and the first in a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions that starred an anthropomorphic pearl-white, fabric-sunroofed 1963 Volkswagen racing Beetle named Herbie. It was based on the 1961 book \\"Car, Boy, Girl\\" by Gordon Buford. - Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing or automobile racing) is a sport involving the racing of automobiles for competition. - In sport, racing is a competition of speed, against an objective criterion, usually a clock or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Herbie the Love Bug is an anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle , a character that is featured in several Disney motion pictures starting with the 1968 feature film The Love Bug . He has a mind of his own and is capable of driving himself , and is also a serious contender in auto racing competitions . Throughout most of the franchise , Herbie is distinguished by red , white and blue racing stripes from front to back bumper , a racing - style number \`\` 53 '' on the front luggage compartment lid , doors , and engine lid , and a yellow - on - black ' 63 California license plate with the lettering \`\` OFP 857 '' . - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'main subject'.","completion":"The subject entity is 'The Love Bug' and the object entity is 'Herbie the Love Bug'.

Combining the terms with 'n' on both sides of the equation, we get: (399 + 312) * n = (1102 - 294) * n + 11058 Now, add 399 and 312: 711 * n = 808 * n + 11058 Now, we want to isolate 'n' on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 711n from both sides: 711 * n - 711 * n = 808 * n - 711 * n + 11058 0 = 97 * n + 11058 Now, we want to isolate 'n' further by getting rid of the constant term 11058. To do this, subtract 11058 from both sides of the equation: -11058 = 97 * n Now that we have isolated 'n' on one side, we can solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 97: -11058 / 97 = n Calculating the result: n=-114"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the movie is as padded as allen 's jelly belly .","completion":"The sentiment of the following sentence can be interpreted as negative. In this context, the statement is comparing the movie to \\"Allen's jelly belly,\\" which alludes to the idea of the movie being bloated, overly extended, or unnecessary in parts. The term \\"padded\\" is often used when discussing a movie or similar artistic work that includes elements that don't contribute to its substance but are added to make it appear longer or more extensive than it needs to be. By associating the movie with a \\"jelly belly,\\" the author is likely suggesting that the movie is somewhat unappealing and undesirable, like excess body fat. It creates a visual metaphor that immediately evokes negative emotions as people usually associate a \\"jelly belly\\" with unhealthy habits or lack of fitness. Consequently, this comparison implies a certain level of dissatisfaction with the movie's overall structure, pacing, and choice of content. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the given sentence is negative because it highlights the displeasing aspects of the movie being compared to an undesirable physical attribute. It suggests that the movie could have been better if it had been more concise, focused, and free of unnecessary elements that only detracted from its overall impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These chilling images taken inside the home of one of America's most prolific child porn collectors reveal his sickening hoard of pacifiers and girl's underwear. The 52-year-old pedophile, who stored one million indecent images of children on discs and hard drives, was arrested in 2013 when police stormed his Orlando apartment. It was there they discovered framed photographs of naked children among piles of garbage and sippy cups. The haul is the largest in Florida's history, with law enforcement describing the contents of the sex offender's home as 'mind-boggling'. Framed photographs of naked children downloaded from the internet were among the sickening indicators of pedophilia found by law enforcement when they swooped on the home of one of America's most prolific child pornography collectors. And despite fearing for his life inside the walls of the Alabama prison where he will spend 20 years, the criminal, a former Navy information systems technician, said 'it would be nice' to be able to access the images again. 'What I did is not worth the hassle … the penalty,' he told USA Today under the promise of anonymity to protect himself from inmates. He claimed to have already been moved from one facility after being threatened by fellow prisoners. Despite possessing one of the largest collections of child pornography on record, the man insists he never acted on his sadistic impulses, confining his pedophilia to his ocean-side home. 'I never touched anybody. There was no direct contact with a victim,' he protested. Prosecutors have not been able to confirm his claim. It started, he said, in 2001, 12 years before being prosecuted, when a single image of a 'very young girl' flashed across his computer screen. 'It piqued my curiosity more than anything,' he remarked, fidgeting in a desk chair. Sippy cups and pacifiers were also discovered at the property in Orlando where the 52-year-old spent 40 uninterrupted days downloading indecent images of children. During a visit to Japan in the 1990s, the man admitted to buying and wearing children's clothes. Girls' underwear and a dress were found by police when they stormed his apartment. Law enforcement described the haul as 'mind boggling' and the largest police had ever seen in Florida's history. From there, his taste graduated from girls between the ages of three and six to those aged eight to 15. Records held by Florida's Department of Law Enforcement reveal the youngest child to appear in his collection was just one. Among the most horrifying of images was one of a two-year-old being sexually abused by an adult female. Another, of a girl around 10, showed her to be tied up with rope. While he claims not to have begun downloading the indecent images until 2001, the former serviceman admitted to 'encounters' with child prostitutes during a 1987 tour of the Philippines. Seven years later in Japan he began wearing children's underwear and buying sippy cups, pacifiers and diapers. Such behavior has 'nothing to do' with the collection of pornography discovered by police some years later, he claimed, adding his only allies in prison were fellow pedophiles. When arrested, the 52-year-old had spent 40 uninterrupted days downloading and looking at child pornography. The end of the binge came when police arrived on his doorstep with a search warrant.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

Question: Which gender of moth is able to detect the other gender? Context: Many insects possess very sensitive and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1 Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2 kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50 kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation.:87–94 Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - The Capital Centre (later known as USAir Arena) was an indoor arena in the eastern United States, located in Landover, Maryland, a suburb east of Washington, D.C.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. After reading the above, is \\"A change in Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What was the assassination of President Hosni Mubarak a tipping point for?\\"? Available choices: a). no b). yes","completion":"b). yes The assassination attempt of President Hosni Mubarak was a tipping point for a change in the Sudanese regime and less support for Bin Laden. This is because, after the attempt, outside pressures increased, and supporters of General Omar al Bashir, the president of Sudan, started to displace those of Turabi, who had supported Bin Laden. This led to the UN Security Council criticizing Sudan and eventually sanctioning it. This also signaled to Bin Laden that he would lose support in Sudan. The answer is not \\"a). no\\" because the passage clearly states that the assassination attempt was indeed a tipping point for the change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite efforts to improve and strengthen community flood defence schemes, many homes and businesses remain vulnerable. The Environment Agency acknowledges that it is impossible to completely flood-proof a property, but there are a number of measures to prevent flood-water getting in and limit the damage. There are a number of routes in which floodwater can enter a property. As well as coming through doors and patios, water can find its way in through air bricks on exposed walls and through gaps in the floor. Another way is via through drains and pipes as the pressure created by flooding can reverse the flow, causing water to back-up and enter a home through sinks, toilets, washing machines etc. The Environment Agency lists two ways that homes and businesses can protect properties: \\"flood resistance\\" measures, and making a building \\"flood resilient\\". Flood resistance refers to preventing water from entering in the first place. The traditional methods of using sandbags can help for short periods when used in conjunction with plastic sheeting, and they can prevent contaminated mud and silt from entering a property. But they do allow water to seep through and are not as effective as purpose-designed flood products. There are a range of products on the market that are designed to offer protection. These include: Flood protection experts recommend that people buy products that have been awarded a kitemark, as this means that the product has undergone a series of tests to ensure it is fit for purpose. If a product is awarded a kitemark, it means that it meets the requirements outlined in PAS-1188 - a quality benchmark developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Environment Agency and other partners. The benchmark covers a range of product types, including removable products that act as barriers across vulnerable points, such as doors and airbricks; temporary, freestanding barriers which are assembled close to, but not in contact with, a building; and property flood skirt systems. As well as fitting flood protection measures to your home, another measure is landscaping your garden in a way that helps divert water away from your property. From the BBC: Elsewhere: It is impossible to guarantee that flood-water will not enter your property, even if you have taken steps to protect your property. The Environment Agency lists a number of ways to make your home \\"flood resilient\\", which will limit the damage and allow residents to return to their property quickly (on average, people are unable to live in their homes for nine months after being flooded). These include: This will depend on the size of your property and the level of flood resistance and resilience you require. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate that protecting a property against shallow flash floods will cost in the region of £2,000-£6,000. However, protection against prolonged flooding requires bigger changes and could cost up to £40,000. But the Environment Agency says taking measures to protect your property will limit the distress and damage caused by flooding, reduce the level of repairs and will allow you to return to your home or business more quickly. As an estimated one-in-six homes are located within at-risk areas, more than one million people have signed up to the Environment Agency's flood warning service. As well as its flood warning service, the Agency has a section on its website that offers practical advice on how people can protect their homes and businesses from flooding, including an interactive guide on ways to reduce flood damage. It also offers advice on how to develop a \\"flood plan\\" and what you and your neighbours need to do once a flood warning has been issued for your area. The National Flood Forum, a charity that is dedicated to representing people living in areas at risk from flooding, has produced the \\"blue pages\\", which is an independent directory of flood protection products. What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about how to protect homes and businesses from floods in the UK. Even though stopping floods completely is not possible, there are ways to lessen the damage they can do. The Environment Agency suggests two ways to do this: to make buildings \\"flood-resistant\\" and \\"flood resilient\\". You can imagine \\"flood-resistant\\" as a big, strong superhero who prevents the water from getting into the building in the first place, and \\"flood resilient\\" as a quick healer who helps the building bounce back faster even if some water gets in. The article also says there are different ways water can sneak in, like through gaps, drains, and even through doors and walls. But don't worry, there are many products available to protect against this, including special barriers and other items - kind of like magic shields! Just like you might choose the best toy with a safety mark to make sure it's top quality, these products also have a kitemark to show they've been tested and will work. The cost of these protections can vary, but the article explains that they could save time, money, and distress in the long run. It's like spending a little money on an umbrella to stay dry instead of getting soaked in the rain and then having to pay more to replace your wet clothes. The article also talks about a warning service and other tools and advice to help people stay safe."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Sleepaway Camp IV: The Survivor Movie plot: Allison Kramer (Carrie Chambers), a survivor of the original Sleepaway Camp, is being plagued by nightmares which gruesomely force her to revisit the camp site. Unable to recall the actual occurrences due to a forced mental block, she seeks the help of a psychiatrist in overcoming her insomnia. After numerous visits and hypnosis, Allison's psychiatrist advises her that she is a survivor of a massacre which occurred at a camp over a decade ago. Her disbelief for the whole situation inclines her doctor to advise her to return to the site for an afternoon, in hopes that if she were to see the scenes of the crimes, she would remember them and overcome them. Doubtful, Allison sets out for the camp she attended but never remembered. When she reaches her destination, she finds the camp to be closed and abandoned, the land now Federal Property. She remininces about the events that occurred in the original trilogy. Allison narrates over many of these scenes. Archive footage from the first three film are organised into themes, such as Angela being afraid of water. Allison looks for the ranger, Jack (John Lodicos), that her psychologist, Dr. Lewis, advised her to meet up with. The ranger tries to have sex with her, but Allison decides things are going too far and runs away. The ranger chases her through the woods. Allison stops because she can run no longer. Then she is found by a hunter, Eugene (Victor Campos). Later on, she approaches the ranger with a gun and threatens to kill him if he doesn't stay away from her. She then approaches the hunter and shoots him. In the next scene, Allison is standing in the sun with a knife, which the sun is reflecting light off of. The ranger approaches her, but she whirls around and the film freezes as she holds the knife near him. It then cuts to a cabin, where you see the ranger's dead body. The credits then roll over the image of his dead body.[2] It is implied in the opening crawl that Allison may actually be Angela, as it states that she \\"is a woman without identity,\\" and asks...

An anonymous do-gooder traveling the country giving servers incredibly generous tips is reportedly multimillionaire former PayPal Vice President Jack Selby. According to ValleyWag, the 39-year-old businessman, who appears to be single, has handed out more than 50,000 in tips in the past three months at cafes and clubs from Michigan to California under the name 'Tipsforjesus.' Each kind gesture has been documented on the Instagram feed Tipsforjesus, which has the tagline, 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' Selby was among a small group of alumni who made an astronomical fortune at PayPal, and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a drycleaning business. While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page. And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme. One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?' Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...' He also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California. Last year, Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of 10 million or less. Selby secured 50 million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company. Tipsforjesus has left a trail of extremely happy servers across the country after dropping the ridiculously generous tips. The servers at the Legends of Notre Dame, pictured, were thrilled by the generous tip. Harris' Restaurant in San Francisco received a 1500 tip on a 468 bill. Selby earned a reputation for leaving extremely generous tips and Instagram-ing photos to prove it such as this one with a waitress who has just received 5,000. Little was known about Tipsforjesus bar an Instagram page until his identity was revealed Wednesday. Until now, little was known about the. mystery money man bar the Instagram page where a series of photographs. have been posted since September of happy servers and receipts bearing. gratuities with up to five figures. Adding. up all the tips posted so far, Tips4jesus has handed out over 54,000. to servers across the country in establishments including Tio's Mexican. Cafe in Ann Arbor, the Paris Club in Chicago and the Hungry Cat in Los. Angeles. To begin with many people – especially waiters and waitresses - questioned the authenticity of the mega-tips which have so far ranged in size from 500 to 10,000. But one lucky recipient came come forward to confirm that Tips4jesus is the real deal. Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, who was lucky enough to pick up a 7,000 tip for a 215 bar tab. Selby was also generous in Phoenix at the restaurant Crudo. Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, was lucky enough to pick up a 7,000 tip for a 215 bar tab, he described Tipforjesus as 'friendly and polite' Tipsforjesus Instagram feed was set up to show the growing number of generous tips. Schulz recently confirmed to local blog. Damn Arbor that the tip was real and that he served the mysterious. Tip4jesus in September when he and his entourage were in town for the. Notre Dame versus Michigan game. According to Schulz, the Tips4jesus crew found themselves at his bar at 1:45am after a couple of other places had turned them away. He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night. Schultz had expectations that perhaps a 50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing 7,000. A black AMEX card was a sure sign that the customer was going to be good for massive tip as the exclusive card is by invitation only and. the average cardholder has 16.3 million in assets and a household. income of 1.3 million. Another happy server poses with her 3,000 tip after a visit from the mysterious Tipsforjesus character, who is believed to be Selby. It's every server's dream to have some super generous customer leave an enormous tip for a job well done and one bartender came forward to confirm that Tipsforjesus was the real deal. At Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tipsforjesus, or Selby, left a 10,000 tip - over two receipts - which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud. According to Schultz, Tips4jesus promised him that the amount was 100 per cent legit and he was good for the amount. He even returned the next day to buy some T-shirts and take the picture that appears on the Instagram account. After the tip cleared Schultz very generously distributed the money amongst the staff who worked that night, in addition to at least one employee who had the night off. But not everyone has been so fortunate with getting their windfall. At a bar called Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tips4jesus left a 10,000 which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud, reports the South Bend Tribune. When the server noted that the tip didn't go through, Tips4jesus replied with a vow to ensure that the charge had been approved and followed that up with a photo of the Amex statement to prove it. Tips4jesus' further offered to help the server, posting, 'Nobody is going to ruin the good were trying to do.'

On Sunday, both The Post and the New York Times assembled more than 20 savants and asked them, as the Times put it, \\"How Can Obama Rebound?\\" Good question. Not only do six out of 10 voters \\"lack faith in the president to make the right decisions for the country,\\" according to a Post-ABC News poll, but Barack Obama does not even get credit for the right decisions he's made. The bank bailout averted a financial crackup and the stimulus package pulled the economy back from the abyss. Along with reform of the financial industry and health care, these are considerable achievements. Only the voters disagree. Why? Some of the answers are apparent. The economy remains sluggish and unemployment remains high. The effects of the health-care act have yet to be felt and the ink is hardly dry on financial reform. Until these measures prove popular, they can be mischaracterized by Republicans and other evil-doers. As for the economy, not letting things get worse is not the same as making them better. If you're out of work, it hardly cheers you that the recession stopped at your house and spared the guy next door. It's your job that matters. So what can be done about all this? The experts in the most mainstream of the mainstream media brimmed with ideas. \\"New thinking\\" could save the day, says David Frum, and a revived war on cancer would work wonders, says Elizabeth Edwards. The Democratic strategist Catherine A. \\"Kiki\\" McLean says Obama should focus on \\"jobs, jobs, jobs,\\" while Matthew Dowd, he of ABC News, suggests the president \\"get off the partisan campaign trail.\\" Donna Brazile urges Obama to step up his rhetoric, and Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator, favors \\"a campaign to promote private-sector innovation.\\" Mark Penn proposes doubling the size of the space program. Edward Rollins thinks Obama would do better if he stopped blaming his predecessor for what ails the country, and Robert Shrum opines that \\"Obama needs only to be himself.\\" (What's that?) All these are nifty suggestions, and some could make a really exciting panel discussion at Brookings. But the fallacy in all of them is apparent when -- as always happens -- Obama is likened to Ronald Reagan. (Shrum does this.) The similarities are superficial, and foremost among them is the fact that Reagan too had dismal numbers at this state of his presidency -- a consequence of a steep recession. In fact, the Republicans lost House seats in the 1982 midterm elections, just as the Democrats are fated to do, according to every conceivable political seer. Reagan, of course, went on to win reelection by a landslide and has since become a Mount Rushmorian figure. Break out the chisels. The comparison to Reagan may give Obama cheer, but it is not really apt. For even in Reagan's darkest days when, according to Gallup, six out of 10 Americans reported that they did not like the job he was doing, an astounding six in 10 nevertheless said they liked the man himself. He was, of course, phenomenally charming, authentic and schooled at countless soundstages in appearing that way. Just as important, the public had faith in the consistency of his principles, agree or not. This was the Reagan Paradox and it helped lift his presidency. No one is accusing Obama of being likable. He is not unlikable, but he lacks Reagan's (or Bill Clinton's) warmth. What's more, his career has been brief. He led no movement, was spokesman for no ideology and campaigned like a Nike sneaker -- change instead of swoosh. He seems distant. No Irish jokes from him. For the average voter, he casts no shadow. Reagan, by contrast, had been around forever. He was not defined solely by gauzy campaign ads but by countless speeches, two contentious and highly controversial terms as California governor, and a previous race for the presidency. There was never a question about who Reagan was and what he stood for. Not so Obama. About all he shares with Reagan at this point are low ratings. What has come to be called the Obama Paradox is not a paradox at all. Voters lack faith in him making the right economic decisions because, as far as they're concerned, he hasn't. He went for health-care reform, not jobs. He supported the public option, then he didn't. He's been cold to Israel's Binyamin Netanyahu and then all over him like a cheap suit. Americans know Obama is smart. But we still don't know him. Before Americans can give him credit for what he's done, they have to know who he is. We're waiting. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the challenges faced by President Barack Obama amidst low voter confidence and unfavorable comparisons to former President Ronald Reagan. Despite Obama's significant achievements such as the bank bailout, stimulus package, financial industry reform, and healthcare reform, the economy remains sluggish, and unemployment is high. Various suggestions are offered to help improve Obama's image, but the author stresses that a key issue lies in the lack of warmth and authenticity in Obama's personality as compared to Reagan's.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Before the Advice, Check Out the Adviser WHEN Elaine and Merlin Toffel, a retired couple in their 70s, needed help with their investments, they went to their local U.S. Bank branch. The tellers knew them by their first names. They were comfortable there. So when a teller suggested that they meet with the bank’s investment brokers, the Toffels made an appointment. After discussions and an evaluation, the bank sold them variable annuities, in which they invested more than 650,000. The annuities promised to generate lifetime income payments. “We wanted to make the most amount of interest we could so if we needed it to live on, we could use it,” said Ms. Toffel, 74, of Lindenhurst, Ill. What she says they didn’t fully understand was that the variable annuities came with a hefty annual charge: about 4 percent of the amount invested. That’s more than 26,000, annually — enough to buy a new Honda sedan every year. What’s more, if they needed to tap the money right away, there would be a 7 percent surrender charge, or more than 45,000. Michael Walsh, a spokesman for U.S. Bank, said that the investments were appropriate for the Toffels, that fees were disclosed and that the sale was completed after months of consultations. But the Toffels now question whether they were given financial advice that was truly in their best interests. Like many consumers, they say they didn’t realize that their broker wasn’t required to follow the most stringent requirement for financial professionals, known as the fiduciary standard. It amounts to this: providing advice that is always 100 percent in the consumer’s interest. Many people think that they are getting that kind of advice when they are not, said Arthur Laby, a professor at the Rutgers School of Law and a former assistant general counsel at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Brokerage customers are, in a certain sense, deceived,” he said. “If brokers continue to call themselves advisers and advertise advisory services, customers believe they are receiving objective advice that is in their best interest. In many cases, however, they are not.” Brokers, like those at the Toffels’ bank, are technically known as registered representatives. They are required only to recommend “suitable” investments based on an investor’s personal situation — their age, investment goals, time horizon and appetite for risk, among other things. “Suitable” may sound like an adequate standard, but there’s a hitch: It can mean that a broker isn’t required to put a customer’s interests before his own. There are some specific situations when brokers must act as fiduciaries — for example, when they collect a percentage of total assets to manage an investment account, or when they are given full control of an investor’s account. But under current rules, a broker can take off his fiduciary hat and recommend merely “suitable” investments for the same customer’s other buckets of money. Confusing? Absolutely. “While many brokers do right by their clients, others push bad products at high prices,” said Knut A. Rostad, the regulatory and compliance officer at Rembert Pendleton Jackson, an investment adviser, and a longtime champion of requiring a uniform fiduciary standard for brokers. “They do so because their culture celebrates sales. They do so because they can.” IT’S a bewildering situation for consumers, particularly as they try to figure out which advisers do follow a fiduciary standard: Investment advisers, who generally must register with the S.E.C. or a state securities regulator, must put their customers’ interests first, regardless of what accounts they are working with. This creates a muddle for investors. Say you sit down with a broker — one who isn’t legally required to act as a fiduciary — and the broker has access to a dozen mutual funds, all of which are deemed “suitable” for a particular customer. The broker can recommend the most expensive fund, even if it makes him more money at the consumer’s expense and isn’t preferable in any other way, Professor Laby said. On the other hand, if advisers are following a fiduciary standard, the proper course is clear: “They have to recommend the one that is the lowest cost” because that will be in a consumer’s best interest, he added. Regulators have been considering whether stronger rules are needed. The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law of 2010 gave the S.E.C. the authority to propose a rule that would require brokers to act as fiduciaries — but the law didn’t actually require the S.E.C. to enact new regulations. The agency hasn’t yet decided whether it will move forward. Two Republican commissioners have publicly questioned whether it is necessary. The Labor Department expects to issue a new proposal in January for a rule that would broaden fiduciary requirements for retirement accounts. In 2010, the department withdrew an earlier proposal after fierce opposition from the financial services industry. Investors can’t simply accept an adviser’s title at face value. For example, certified financial planners, a professional designation with some of the more rigorous curriculum and experience requirements, pledge to put their customers’ interests ahead of their own when providing advice — and can lose their designation if they don’t. But even they do not have to act as fiduciaries if they are just selling an investment without including any advice, said Craig W. Lemoine, a program director at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. To make matters worse, many brokers call themselves “advisers,” a term that suggests consumers can unequivocally trust their counsel much as they might trust the family physician’s. Merrill Lynch, for instance, recently introduced an approach called Merrill Lynch Clear — which is essentially a way for the company to set up a conversation with customers about their longer-term goals and priorities, including family or health issues or whether they need long-term care insurance. Merrill advertises this approach on its website as a conversation with a “trusted adviser,” though not all of its “advisers” are legally bound by a fiduciary duty. Matt Card, a Merrill Lynch spokesman, says the firm’s focus on customers’ broad goals is designed to put a client’s interests first, regardless of whether its representatives are acting as fiduciaries. Even if stronger protections are enacted, some advisers at financial firms may face potential conflicts of interest, depending on issues like sales goals or incentives that encourage them to push financial products that aren’t ideal for customers. A former senior account executive at Fidelity, who left last year to join a small independent firm, said he was given sales targets that helped to determine whether he would receive bonuses or retain his job. (He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he needed to protect colleagues who were still at the company.) “By far, the biggest two weightings were on your ability to sell annuities and portfolio advisory services,” he said, referring to a program in which Fidelity investment accounts are managed for a fee. “So if you hit all the other goals but missed one of these two, there was a good risk that you could be put on verbal or written warning and quite possibly terminated.” Joseph Madden, a Fidelity spokesman, said representatives’ compensation is based on whether their advice was appropriate for the customer, as well as other factors related to sales, service and customer satisfaction. Advisers’ pay can provide clues about whether their interests may be mismatched with consumers’. At the largest brokerage firms — Merrill, Wells Fargo, UBS and Morgan Stanley — there are incentives to bring in new money. These firms typically pay their brokers and advisers 45 to 55 percent of fees and commissions generated for their companies, explained Alois Pirker, research director of wealth management at the Aite Group, which tracks and advises the financial services industry. “They are very much hunters,” he said. “They are hunting for assets.” Some brokers may collect a higher percentage of the money they generate for the firm once they hit certain thresholds. That may reward hard workers, as outlined in a 2013 report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the brokerage industry’s private self-regulator. But it could also encourage an increase in the number or a shift in the types of recommendations that brokers make to customers. Conflicts can also arise when a brokerage firm receives money from, say, a mutual fund provider through a practice known as revenue sharing: Those funds may land on a “preferred list,” which a broker may favor. It may be less confusing for consumers to simply pay for advice through “fee-only” independent financial planners who are fiduciaries. Independent planners typically charged from 0.85 percent to 1.15 percent of assets at the end of 2013, according to Cerulli Associates, though fees can vary depending on how much you have to invest. (There is always the additional cost of the underlying investments, though they can be quite low.) Often, in addition to investment advice, those fees cover issues like how much to save or how much term life insurance to buy. Other advisers charge a single flat fee or hourly fees. The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Garrett Planning Network are groups of fee-only planners, while a network of advisers, called the XY Planning Network, charges subscription fees, typically around 100 a month. IF consumers really want to put prospective advisers to the test, they could try a direct approach: Ask them to sign an oath stating they will act as fiduciaries, like the one recently created by the Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, an advocacy group. Andrew Stoltmann, a securities lawyer in Chicago, said such an oath would be binding in an arbitration proceeding, which is how a vast majority of customer disputes are settled. “If the adviser refused to sign it, then the investor should run for the hills,” he said. A fiduciary pledge doesn’t protect an investor from outright chicanery, however. Consider the case of the former Seattle investment adviser Mark Spangler, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison for defrauding customers and money laundering. He previously served as a chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, a group whose advisers pledge to act as fiduciaries. Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said a fiduciary standard might protect people from brokers who are acting legally but who aren’t recommending the best options for them. “Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that investors suffer real financial harm — albeit unquantifiable harm — as a result of so-called ‘advice’ to invest in products that have high costs, that expose them to unnecessary risks or that simply offer mediocre performance relative to other options,” Ms. Roper said. The Toffels, who bought their investments through their bank’s brokerage unit, now wish they had taken much more care in choosing their advisers. “We thought they could help us invest our money smartly and soundly and that just hasn’t happened,” Ms. Toffel said. When the couple initially went to the bank for investment help, they had a portfolio of low-cost Vanguard funds, with an allocation in the stock market that was probably too high, according to the Toffels’ son-in-law, Christopher Lombardo. But following the bank’s advice, instead of merely adjusting that portfolio, they sold it and paid taxes on the capital gains. They put most of their money in the annuities, which were invested in mutual funds and paid 5 percent each year. But the illiquidity of the annuities caused serious problems last year, Ms. Toffel said. While the couple followed the bank’s suggestion and held more than 200,000 in money market funds, they found that they were short of cash because their life situation had changed: Mr. Toffel, 78, received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and needed to move into a skilled nursing facility, while Ms. Toffel wanted to buy an apartment in the same senior community. But much of their money was locked inside those very costly annuities, which carried the 7 percent surrender charge. “I was sick about it,” said Tammy Lombardo, the couple’s daughter. Her husband, Mr. Lombardo, has spent many hours documenting their predicament and petitioning the bank for a hardship withdrawal, which has been successful. They ultimately received some of the money from the annuities without paying the surrender charge, but they are still trying to undo other changes made by the bank to their financial arrangements. “It’s been a mountain of red tape and hoops to jump through,” Mr. Lombardo said. Required to make “suitable” recommendations to investors based on criteria like age, goals, time horizon and risk appetite. Generally not required to put customers’ interest first at all times, a standard called fiduciary duty.

The bank's investment brokers sold them variable annuities with a hefty annual charge of about 4 percent, equaling over 26,000 a year, and a 7 percent surrender charge if they needed access to the money immediately.

News article: WASHINGTON (April 28, 2017)--A new study examining the muscular system of bonobos provides firsthand evidence that the rare great ape species may be more closely linked, anatomically, to human ancestors than common chimpanzees. Previous research suggested this theory at the molecular level, but this is the first study to compare in detail the anatomy of the three species. \\"Bonobo muscles have changed least, which means they are the closest we can get to having a 'living' ancestor,\\" said Bernard Wood, professor of human origins at the GW Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology. Scientists believe that modern human and common chimpanzee/bonobo lineages split about 8 million years ago with the two great ape species splitting about 2 million years ago. As common chimpanzees and bonobos evolved after their split, they developed different traits and physical characteristics, even though they remained geographically relatively close, with their main division being the Congo River. Because of this, researchers have been curious as to what those differences are and how they compare to humans. By studying the muscles of bonobos (which indicates how they physically function), the team was able to discover that they are more closely related to human anatomy than common chimpanzees, in the sense that their muscles have changed less than they have in common chimpanzees. Earlier studies examined the DNA similarities and differences between bonobos and common chimpanzees, but this was the first study to compare the muscles of the three species. \\"In addition, our study has shown that there is a mosaic evolution of the three species, in the sense that some features are shared by humans and bonobos, others by humans and common chimpanzees, and still others by the two ape species,\\" said Rui Diogo, lead author of the paper and associate professor of anatomy at Howard University. \\"Such a mosaic anatomical evolution may well be related to the somewhat similar molecular mosaic evolution between the three species revealed by previous genetic studies: each of the chimpanzees species share about 3 percent of genetic traits with humans that are not present in the other chimpanzee species.\\" The researchers led a team that examined seven bonobos from the Antwerp Zoo that had died and were being preserved. Researchers said this was an extremely rare opportunity given bonobos' status as an endangered species. The scientists note that having a clear understanding of what makes humans different from our closest living relatives might lead to new breakthroughs or understandings of human health. # The paper, \\"Bonobo anatomy reveals stasis and mosaicism in chimpanzee evolution, and supports bonobos as the most appropriate extant model for the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans,\\" published in Scientific Reports, a Nature publication, this month. ||||| Among the 166 HN and FL muscle characters recognized in our earlier phylogenetic studies6, 7, there were 16 character state differences between common chimpanzees and modern humans (Figs 1 and 2; see SI). The new HL data added 12 more differences: the usual absence in modern humans of a psoas minor, ischiofemoralis, adductor minimus, opponens hallucis, contrahentes pedis, opponens digiti minimi, and of tendons of flexor hallucis longus to digits 3–4, and the presence of a fibularis tertius, of digit 2 as the interossei axis of the foot, and of fibularis longus-medial cuneiform, soleus-tibia and flexor digitorum brevis-digit 5 attachments (see Fig. 3 and refs 11, 15). Therefore, since the chimpanzee-human split c.8 Mya, the divergence rate for striated muscle gross morphology has been c.3.5 characters per million years (Ma). In comparison, across the body there are seven differences in muscle morphology between common chimpanzees and bonobos (Figs 1 and 3; SI). This divergence rate of c.3.5 muscle characters per Ma since common chimpanzees and bonobos split c.2 Ma is similar to the divergence rate for common chimpanzees and modern humans. Interestingly, only one of the common chimpanzee/bonobo differences involves HN muscles: bonobos have a single belly of the omohyoideus, compared to the two bellies that are usually present in both common chimpanzees and modern humans (Fig. 1). Three of the differences are in the FL: (1) the intermetacarpales and flexores breves profundi muscles in the hand of bonobos fuse to form dorsal interossei, a shared feature with modern humans; (2) bonobos have a stout tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus attaching to digit 1, and (3) an attachment between the pectoralis minor and the coracoid process of the scapula (Fig. 2). In the HL, bonobos retain a scansorius and have popliteus-fibula and extensor hallucis longus-proximal big toe phalanx attachments: all these features are missing in common chimpanzees and modern humans (Fig. 3). Figure 1 Differences between head muscles of common chimpanzees, bonobos and modern humans. There are no major consistent differences concerning the presence/absence of muscles in adult common chimpanzees (left) and bonobos (center), the only minor difference (shown in grey in the common chimpanzee scheme) being that the omohyoideus has no intermediate tendon in bonobos, contrary to common chimpanzees (and modern humans). In contrast, there are many differences between bonobos and modern humans (right) concerning the presence/absence of muscles in the normal phenotype (shown in colors and/or with labels in the human scheme). See text for more details. Full size image Figure 2 Differences between forelimb muscles of common chimpanzees, bonobos and modern humans. The only consistent difference between bonobos (center) and common chimpanzees (left) concerning the presence/absence of muscles (shown in colors in the common chimpanzee and bonobos schemes) is that in the former the intermetacarpales 1–4 are usually fused with the flexores breves profundi 3, 5, 6 and 8 to form the dorsal interossei muscles 1–4 (* in bonobo) figure, as is the case in modern humans. In contrast, there are many differences between bonobos and modern humans (right) concerning the presence/absence of muscles (shown in colors and/or with labels in the human scheme; muscles present in chimpanzees and not in humans are shown in black, in chimpanzees). See text for more details. Full size image Figure 3 Differences between hindlimb muscles of common chimpanzees, bonobos and modern humans. The only consistent difference between bonobos (center) and common chimpanzees (left) concerning the presence/absence of muscles (shown in colors in the common chimpanzee scheme) is that the latter usually lack the scansorius, as is the case in humans. In contrast, there are many differences between bonobos and modern humans (right) concerning the presence/absence of muscles (shown in colors and/or with labels in the human scheme; muscles present in chimpanzees and not in humans are shown in black, in chimps). See text for more details. Full size image Importantly, of the seven common chimpanzee/bonobo differences only two, the presence of dorsal interossei and scansorius in bonobos, concern major differences (i.e., presence/absence of muscles). This contrasts with the 20 major differences between common chimps and modern humans (13 for HN-FL + 7 for HL). The seven common chimpanzee modern human HL muscle absence/presence differences were listed within the 12 HL differences listed in paragraph above. The 13 HN-FL differences are: the presence in modern humans of the HN muscles temporoparietalis, risorius and arytenoideus obliquus (these two latter muscles are only present as variants in chimpanzees) and of the FL muscles rhomboideus minor, flexor pollicis longus, adductor pollicis accessorius, extensor pollicis brevis; presence in common chimpanzees of the FL muscles levator claviculae, dorsoepitrochlearlis, epitrochleoanconeus, contrahentes to digits 4 and 5, and intermetacarpales (Figs 1, 2 and 3 and refs 11, 15). The number of major bonobo-human muscle absence/presence differences is exactly the same, i.e. 13, because bonobos and modern humans do not have distinct intermetacarpales (Fig. 2), but bonobos are different from modern humans in having a scansorius (Fig. 3). Thus, although the overall common chimpanzee/bonobo vs. modern human, and common chimpanzee vs. bonobo divergence rates are similar overall, in terms of major changes the common chimpanzee vs. bonobo divergence rate (two character state differences in c.2.0 Ma) is strikingly (>2.5 times) lower than the common chimpanzee vs. modern human divergence rate of 20 major changes in c.8 Ma. The rate for the bonobo vs. modern human divergence is also higher (>1.6 times) than the bonobo vs. common chimp divergence concerning major changes, because there are also 13 major differences between the musculature of bonobos and modern humans. This is because in the FL bonobos and modern humans have dorsal interossei in contrast to common chimpanzees (Fig. 2), but in the HL bonobos differ from modern humans and common chimpanzees because they retain a scansorius (Fig. 3). Remarkably, all seven differences between common chimpanzees and bonobos are features that are shared by one of the two panin species and modern humans. Moreover, the analysis of these differences reveals a mosaic evolution across the three lineages. Different anatomical regions are evolving in markedly different ways in different taxa: the four features shared between common chimpanzees and modern humans concern the HN and HL muscles, whereas the three bonobo-modern human similarities concern the FL muscles. It will be interesting to investigate whether the four former features are under the control of the approximately three per cent of the modern human genome that is more closely related to the common chimpanzees, and the three later features are linked with the three per cent of our genome that is shared with the genome of bonobos4. The relatively small number of changes in striated muscle morphology in the panin clade compared to the human clade is particularly evident when the data for P. paniscus are included in a phylogenetic analysis of the 166 HN and FL muscle characters used in our previous studies6, 7 (Fig. 4 and SI). Importantly, the inclusion of these data affected the distribution of synapomorphies at two thirds (6/10) of the nodes in the tree (Fig. 4), including the one leading to modern humans, relative to the tree obtained in our previous analyses (see refs 6, 7). Firstly, there was a removal of the 0 –> 1 change of char. 112 (CS1 vestigial tendon of long flexor to distal phalanx of digit 1) from the node leading to great apes + humans and of the 1 –> 0 change of this character from the human lineage, as the presence of a non-vestigial tendon in bonobos now makes it equally parsimonious to have CS1 acquired in great apes + humans and then reverted in humans and bonobos or an independent acquisition of CS1 in common chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans (3 steps). Secondly, the 0 –> 1 change in char. 66 (CS1 intermediate tendon of omohyoideus present) was removed in the node leading to panins + humans, as the absence of tendon in bonobos now makes it equally parsimonious to have acquisition of the tendon in this node and subsequent loss in bonobos or an independent acquisition in P. troglodytes and modern humans (2 steps). Thirdly, two of the features that were previously seen as Pan synapomorphies (concerning char. 140: CS1 intermetacarpales not present as separate muscles; and char. 83: CS1 pectoralis minor going to coracoid process) are now assigned to P. troglodytes, i.e. reversion to CS0 in both characters. Thus, the Pan clade thus now has only two synapomorphies (reversion to CS0 in char. 120: CS1 not having a distinct epitrochleoanconeus; and in char. 131: CS1 contrahentes digitorum missing). These changes emphasize the importance of taking information about bonobos into account in studies on human evolution. Figure 4 Cladogram showing evolutionary changes in head-forelimb musculature in hominoids. Single most parsimonious tree (L = 303, CI = 57, RI = 75) obtained in our phylogenetic analysis; for a key of the characters and character state changes show in the cladogram, see text and SI. Note how node leading to LCA of two Pan species has only two changes; P. troglodytes then accumulated two changes, with no changes in the bonobo lineage (for more details, see text). Note that the phylogenetic software converts P. paniscus and P. troglodytes into P. Paniscus and P. Troglodytes. Full size image As can be seen in Fig. 4, the rate of HN and FL muscle evolutionary changes in the human clade (4 in 8 Ma, i.e. 0.5 per Ma) is twice that in the chimpanzee clade (8 in 8 Ma, i.e. 1 per Ma). Moreover, all the four changes in the chimpanzee clade are reversions to the ancestral state, i.e. there is not even a single acquisition of a derived muscle feature within that clade, whereas in the human clade there are several examples of muscles that are not part of the normal phenotype in any other primate (i.e., they are autapomorphies). A similar picture also applies to the striated musculature of the hindlimb, in that all of the 12 differences in HL muscles between common chimpanzees/bonobos vs. modern humans are due to derived changes in the lineage leading to modern humans (Fig. 3)15. Furthermore, since the split between common chimpanzees and bonobos c.2 Mya the only two changes that occurred in the chimpanzee clade are within the lineage leading to common chimpanzees. That is, within all the 124 HN and FL muscles of bonobos (Table S2) there is not a single minor change - even including a simple site of origin or attachment, or a fusion, of a muscle - in the 2 Ma of evolution of the bonobo lineage. This is a striking example of evolutionary stasis. To put these results in perspective, it is useful to compare them with those of our previous paper focusing specifically on the comparison of primate morphological (muscle) and molecular evolutionary rates13. This is because the phylogenetic analysis, terminal taxa and muscle characters that were used as a basis for that paper are exactly the same as those used for the present paper, with the difference that we now include bonobos as an additional terminal taxon (see SI and Fig. 4). It should be noted that for the earlier paper the muscle rates were calculated taking into account both the split between clades and the time of appearance of each terminal taxon (genus) calculated by taking into account genetic data available for various species within a genus. Figure 4 of this genus (as they are shared by different gorilla species) were assumed to have been acquired during 7.1 Ma, i.e. a rate of 0.28 (2/7.1) changes per Ma. Using the same methodology, in that paper the muscle rate leading to the genus Pongo was 0.51 changes per Ma. As explained in detail in that paper, these muscle evolutionary rates are very slow when compared with the rates leading to other hominoid terminal taxa such as Hylobates (rate of 2.72) and Homo (rate of 1.77; for more details, see that paper). So, if we were to use the same methodology in order to compare those rates in a systematic way with the results obtained for chimpanzees in the cladistic analysis of the present paper and thus set the chimpanzee/human split at 7.5 Mya and the origin of the genus Pan at c. 3 Mya as we did in that paper, instead of using respectively the 8 Mya and 2 Mya dates suggested in more recent genetic studies (see above) the rate leading to Pan in the cladogram of Fig. 4 would be only 4.4 muscle changes per Ma (2 muscle changes in 4.5 MMa). This results in a rate even lower than the very slow rate of 0.51 leading to the genus Pongo, for instance. Moreover, within all the hominoid genera, Pan is the only one that lacks a unique feature/muscle character state - or even a derived character - as a synapomorphy. The only two muscles changes acquired are reversions to the plesiomorphic state and, even more remarkably, there we no muscle changes, major or minor, leading to P. paniscu s, as noted above. These new bonobo data are also relevant to two major ongoing debates in biological sciences. The first is whether bonobos or common chimpanzees are a better model for the last common ancestor (LCA) of chimpanzees, and of chimpanzees and modern humans. Zihlman and colleagues have suggested that, within the two extant chimpanzee species, bonobos make a more suitable model for the two LCAs21,22,23,24, but others have proposed that bonobos are highly derived chimpanzees, being for instance adapted to unique ecological conditions that selected for a specialized locomotor habits25. Our data do not support the latter suggestion because bonobos do not display a single muscle or muscle feature that is unique within primate, or even hominoid, evolution. In fact, it is now becoming increasingly accepted that the bonobo-common chimpanzee divergence was likely mainly due to the barrier to gene flow created by the formation of the Congo River c.1.5–2.5 Mya. Since then relatively little hybridization has occurred between bonobos and common chimpanzees on opposite sides of this river4. This scenario can therefore help to explain why the anatomical differences between the two Pan species are so minor when compared to the striking anatomical differences between them and humans. The second debate is about hypothesized differences in the ontogenetic trajectories of common chimpanzees and bonobos. Some have argued that bonobos are more paedomorphic than chimpanzees26, but more recently Bolter and Zihlman27 suggested that skeletal development in common chimpanzees is slower than that of bonobos, an idea also partially supported in a recent study linking phenotypic development and genotypic variation in common chimpanzees and bonobos28. One of the two major (presence/absence) muscle differences between these two species is consistent with the hypothesis that the musculoskeletal development of common chimps is slower than that of bonobos. This is because early in human ontogeny the intermetacarpales are distinct muscles (as they remain in adult common chimpanzees), and only in the later stages of human development do they become fused with the flexores breves profundi to form the dorsal interossei (as they are in adult bonobos)29, 30. These discussions emphasize how the study of the soft tissues of bonobos and other apes is crucial for a comprehensive and integrative understanding of the evolution and biology of chimpanzees, other apes, and primates, and ultimately of our own human lineage. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Scientists have found that bonobos, a rare great ape species, might be more closely related to human ancestors than common chimpanzees.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Making friends is an essential aspect of human socialization that brings people together and plays a significant role in personal development, happiness, and well-being. To make friends, you need to develop specific social skills, display empathy, embrace various interests, and practice patience. Here's a detailed guide on how to make friends, both in and out of the technological realm. 1. Develop self-awareness: Before reaching out to other people, work on your self-awareness and understand your social strengths and weaknesses. Identifying areas of personal improvement will help you become a better friend. 2. Be open to meeting new people: To make friends, it's essential to embrace meeting people from different walks of life, whether it's in-person or online. Attend social gatherings, join clubs, engage in hobbies, and expand your social circles – all of these activities can help you meet new people and build connections. 3. Show genuine interest: When talking with others, be genuinely interested in what they have to say. Ask open-ended questions and listen attentively. People are generally drawn to individuals who truly care about their thoughts and experiences. 4. Emphasize common ground: Focus on shared interests, hobbies, and experiences to build a connection with people you meet. Being relatable helps create a foundation upon which friendship can grow. 5. Communicate effectively: Effective communication includes both active listening and clear self-expression. Understand the perspectives of others, while also sharing your own thoughts and feelings in a respectful manner. 6. Be empathetic: Display empathy and compassion, especially when your friends are experiencing difficulties or challenges. Being supportive and understanding will help strengthen your friendships. 7. Practice patience: Building a strong and meaningful friendship takes time and effort. Be patient as relationships naturally progress at different paces. 8. Be reliable and trustworthy: Keep your promises, maintain confidentiality, and demonstrate loyalty. Being reliable and trustworthy will earn you the respect and admiration of your friends. 9. Engage in social activities: Plan social events, attend gatherings, and get involved in group activities. An active social life creates opportunities to make new friends and maintain existing connections. 10. Stay open to technological avenues: While it's essential to maintain a balance between technology and real-life connections, utilizing social media and online platforms can help you make friends too. Meet people who share your interests in online forums, gaming communities, or social media platforms. Now, to address the second question: how to make friends that are not in tech? While the second question may appear similar in meaning to the first one, it addresses a slightly different issue. This question concerns making friends who have different interests and are not technology-oriented, whereas the first question is more general. Here are some strategies to help you make friends with interests outside of technology: 1. Diversify your interests: Explore new subjects and develop hobbies apart from technology, such as art, sports, literature, or nature. Broadening your interests will give you more common ground with a wider range of people. 2. Attend non-technology events: Join clubs, classes, and social groups that are unrelated to technology. These events provide a chance to meet people who share your newfound interests. 3. Share your expertise kindly: While you want to make connections outside of the tech realm, you may have unique technological knowledge that can be helpful to others. Share this knowledge with your new friends when appropriate, but avoid being condescending or flaunting your expertise. 4. Learn from your non-tech friends: Just as you have knowledge to share, your non-tech friends have their own areas of expertise. Be open to learning from them and respect their skills and interests. 5. Be active on non-tech platforms: If you're using technology to communicate with others, participate in online forums, social media platforms, or groups that cater to your non-technology interests. In summary, these two questions are not mere paraphrases of each other. While both seek to understand the process of making friends, the first question has a broader scope, whereas the second question specifically focuses on befriending individuals with interests outside the domain of technology. By understanding these nuances and following the various strategies outlined above, you can successfully make friends in and out of tech and enrich your social life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: Five Sussex Police officers could face criminal charges following the death of a man who died after he was arrested.","completion":"Title: Potential Criminal Charges Loom for Sussex Police Officers Following In-Custody Death Introduction In a shocking turn of events, five Sussex Police officers are currently under investigation and may face criminal charges in connection with the death of a man who died shortly after being arrested. The case has gained significant attention, eliciting a widespread call for a thorough examination of the events leading to the tragic incident and further review of the officers' actions. Background While the official report is yet to be released, sources close to the matter have provided a clearer understanding of the incident. The man, whose identity is currently withheld by the authorities, was arrested based on undisclosed charges. Following the arrest, he was transported to the custody suite where he later passed away. The cause of death is still under investigation. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the independent body responsible for investigating complaints against the police, swiftly launched an inquiry into the matter. As the investigation progressed, critical evidence emerged implicating five Sussex Police officers' potential misconduct during the arrest and detention process. Criminal Charges and Their Implications The exact nature and severity of the criminal charges the five officers could face remain undisclosed. However, the possibility of criminal charges being filed indicates that the IOPC suspects significant misconduct, which may have played a direct or indirect role in the man's death. Possible charges could range from excessive force, negligence, manslaughter, or even murder, depending on the investigation's outcome. Should the officers be charged, the event's aftermath may have significant implications for the broader policing community. The legal proceedings surrounding the case will be closely monitored, and a high-profile court case will likely spark public debate on police accountability and potential systemic issues within the police force. Additionally, the case could serve as a referendum on current officer training methods, mental health awareness, and the use of force in various arrest situations. Concerns for Police Accountability and Systemic Issues The incident has fueled public concern over police accountability, putting law enforcement agencies under increased scrutiny. The possibility of criminal charges filed against the officers in question raises questions about the transparency of police work, the use of force in arrest situations, and the general protection of detainee rights. Many argue that systemic issues within the police force may contribute to violence or negligence in arrest situations. The five Sussex Police officers' potential criminal charges underscore the need for a comprehensive review of policies and practices to address these issues effectively. Furthermore, police departments across the nation may face increasing pressure to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to improving officer training and ensuring safe environments for detainees. Conclusion The ongoing investigation into the death of a man under Sussex Police's custody serves as a stark reminder of the importance of police accountability and the need for improved procedures at every stage of the arrest and detainment process. As the IOPC continues its investigation, a clearer picture of the possible criminal charges and the case's broader implications will emerge. Regardless of the outcome, the incident has already ignited public conversations on police conduct, use of force, and accountability measures. It is an opportunity for law enforcement agencies to re-evaluate their practices and policies, ensuring that such tragic occurrences are thoroughly investigated and that appropriate measures are taken to prevent their recurrence."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me.

My room at the hotel had been given to somebody else and they had no room for me. Harkin had known my travel plans and had planned everything. How could he have booked the room only for three days? There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel, and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport, thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city, they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport. There was one small matter: the room rate was 300 per night. The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only 145. I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time. The hotel was far from the train station, so I had to take a taxi, as 25. On the way to the Holiday Inn, we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of 104. At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot. \\"No, this is a 4star hotel,\\" the waiter told me. \\"In that case,\\" I replied, \\"I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel.\\" But she warned me that they were probably full and that if I didn't take the room, it might not be available when I came back.

Bugs pops out in Golden Gate Park and encounters a man, who asks Bugs to hold his balloons while he ties his shoelaces. Bugs complies, but soon finds himself lifted in the air by the balloons and drifting off into the ocean. Eventually he clashes in midair with a stork delivering a kangaroo joey, leading to Bugs getting switched with the joey, brought to Australia, and dropped into a kangaroo's arms. Bugs refuses to be the kangaroo's baby, but feels guilty after the kangaroo starts crying and agrees to be its 'baby'.

In these two sentences (1) Spray paint on the wall. (2) Spray water on someone., does the word spray mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, the word 'spray' in both sentences has the same fundamental meaning, but is applied differently based on the context. 'Spray', as a verb, generally means to disperse or distribute small droplets or particles of a substance over a wide area in a low concentration, often in a quick motion. This concept remains the same in both sentences; however, the substance being sprayed and the nature of application vary. In the sentence, \\"Spray paint on the wall\\", 'spray' refers to applying paint in a dispersed or scattered fashion onto a wall. This is usually done with a spray can or an airbrush, a tool that when activated will propel particles of paint outward in a fine mist. The paint is evenly distributed across a surface, reducing the appearance of brushstroke lines and providing a smooth, seamless coverage. In this context, 'spray' implies an art technique which results in an even coat of paint because of the dispersed small droplets. In the sentence, \\"Spray water on someone\\", 'spray' still refers to the act of dispersing small droplets, but in this case, it's water rather than paint. This could be achieved by various means, possibly through a water gun, a garden hose with a certain setting, or even a simple spray bottle. The purpose here isn't to evenly cover a surface for artistic or functional purposes, but perhaps to cool someone off in hot weather or simply for playful fun. In understanding this, we see that the context of the usage of 'spray' defines its specific interpretation, but fundamentally, 'spray' as a verb refers to the scattered, usually forceful ejection of small particles of a particular substance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. The Han also expanded southward. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC, followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. In China's first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Question: In the passage above, discuss the territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC and the resulting administrative and defense measures implemented by the Han. Additionally, explain the implications of the first nationwide census taken in 2 AD for the size and scope of the Han dynasty. Answer: The passage recounts several key territorial expansions of the Han dynasty from 115 to 60 BC, highlighting their military conquests and establishment of control over new territories. Initially, the Han forces fought against the Xiongnu for control over the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Emerging victorious, they established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which was responsible for the region's defense and foreign affairs. This strategic move allowed the Han dynasty to protect its newly-acquired territories and ensure their political stability. In addition to their conquests in the Tarim Basin and the establishment of the Protectorate, the passage also notes the Han dynasty's southern expansions. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC allowed the Han to extend their rule into modern-day Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. They continued their expansion by incorporating Yunnan through the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC. The Han dynasty's influence reached as far as parts of the Korean Peninsula, where they established Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. These colonial establishments served as administrative centers, allowing the Han dynasty to effectively govern and manage their expanding territories. The passage also mentions the first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, which recorded 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households. This information is significant because it reflects the enormity of the Han dynasty's population and the vast scope of their territory. The census data provides an insight into the complexity of governing such a large number of people, as well as the extensive resources and infrastructure necessary to maintain the realm's stability and prosperity. As a result, the census highlights the importance of the Han dynasty's territorial expansions and the establishment of various administrative, defense, and foreign affairs measures in maintaining their power and influence across the region."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He places one in refrigerated storage, but forgot one and left it out on the counter top. and a hint : Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Please answer this question : Which sample will be viable for a shorter time, the one on the counter top or the one in refrigerated storage? A:","completion":"The sample that will be viable for a shorter time is the one left on the counter top. The reason is that temperature plays an important role in the stability and longevity of enzymes. At lower temperatures, enzymes can remain functional and stable for longer periods of time. When Thomas left the sample on the counter top, it was exposed to room temperature, which is generally higher than the temperature inside the refrigerated storage unit. As a result, the enzymes in the sample on the counter top undergo faster degradation and lose their viability at a quicker pace than the sample placed in the refrigerated storage. On the other hand, the enzymes in the sample placed in refrigerated storage are subjected to a lower temperature, which helps to slow down any chemical reactions and thus preserve the enzyme's stability and functionality for a longer time. This leads to a higher likelihood of the sample remaining viable when compared to the one left on the counter top."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches What might be the last step of the process?

He once was an extreme-left militant and a founding member of the Red Army Faction, but later became a Maoist before switching to Neo-Nazism. Between 2000 and 2003, he was a member of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany. Since 2003, he has repeatedly been convicted of \\"Volksverhetzung\\" (\\"incitement of popular hatred\\") and Holocaust denial and is currently serving a twelve-year prison sentence. - The Dow Jones Industrial Average , also called DJIA, the Industrial Average, the Dow Jones, the Dow Jones Industrial, ^DJI, the Dow 30 or simply the Dow, is a stock market index, and one of several indices created by \\"Wall Street Journal\\" editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow. The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990.

After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - Banaadir (or \\"Bandir\\") is an administrative region (\\"gobol\\") in southeastern Somalia.

They demanded the release of ten RAF members detained at the Stammheim Prison plus two Palestinian compatriots held in Turkey and US15 million in exchange for the hostages. The assassination of Siegfried Buback, the attorney-general of West Germany on 7 April 1977, and the failed kidnapping and murder of the banker Jürgen Ponto on 30 July 1977, marked the beginning of the German Autumn.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no coal available happens, how will it affect MORE power produced by the steam engine. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the original source of energy in the process - In this case, coal is the energy source for heating the boiler. Step 2: Consider the perturbation - No coal is available. Step 3: Analyze the consequences of the perturbation on the process - Since there is no coal to heat the boiler, the boiler cannot generate heat. Step 4: Evaluate the effect of this consequence on the rest of the process: - The water tank over the boiler will not be heated, so no steam will be produced. - The steam cannot be funneled to the piston since it is not being generated. - The piston will not receive any energy from the steam, so it will not move. - The crankshaft will not receive any motion from the piston and thus will not move. Step 5: Conclusion of the direct or indirect effect of the perturbation - The absence of coal in the process has a direct effect on the power produced by the steam engine. Without coal, no energy can be provided to heat the boiler, leading to a chain reaction affecting all other components in the system. This ultimately results in the steam engine not producing any power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

This article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers?, what is it ?

Question: Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish, and most sponges are sessile. Given these facts, what can be a source of food for many species of fish among the following options: - Fully cooking the oysters - Organic compounds - beef - fishing poles - sessile organisms - barnacles - grass - gastropod shells Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's evaluate the given options step-by-step and relate them to the facts provided. 1. Fully cooking the oysters: This option is irrelevant as the question is about a natural food source, not a prepared dish. 2. Organic compounds: While organic compounds are essential for life, the question is more specific about a particular type of food source. 3. Beef: Beef is not a natural food source for most species of fish. 4. Fishing poles: This option is an inanimate object and not a food source. 5. Sessile organisms: The fact is given that most sponges are sessile and they are a source of food for many species of fish. This option is relevant and directly connected to the facts. 6. Barnacles: Barnacles are sessile organisms, so they could potentially be a food source for some fish species. However, the question is focused on sponges. 7. Grass: Grass is not a common food source for many species of fish, especially if they eat sponges. 8. Gastropod shells: This option indicates the shells, not the gastropods themselves, which makes it irrelevant as a food source.

Article: Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the standard concert repertoire are male composers, even though there has been a large number of women composers throughout the classical music period. Musicologist Marcia Citron has asked \\"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\\" Citron \\"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works.\\" She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.

Staff member at Manchester Piccadilly railway station raised the alarm. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Train Driver Pleads Guilty to Drink-Driving Charges Following Alert from Manchester Station Staff Member\\" Introduction: A train driver from Manchester was charged with drink-driving, following concerns from a railway station staff member who noticed her slurred speech. Felicity Hall, 46, pleaded guilty in court, bringing to light the importance of vigilance when it comes to the safety of passengers and fellow staff members in the railway industry. Main Body: Felicity Hall, a 46-year-old train driver from Horwich, Manchester, admitted to charges of drink-driving after an incident at Manchester Piccadilly railway station. The case came to light when a staff member observed Hall slurring her words before she was scheduled to drive passengers. The concerned staff member took swift action, raising the alarm with management. Upon receiving reports of Felicity's condition, the railway officials promptly removed Hall from her duties. Following an investigation, which involved assessing her blood alcohol content, it was confirmed that the train driver was indeed above the legal limit to operate a vehicle. Consequently, she was charged with drink-driving. Felicity Hall quickly entered a guilty plea in court, sparing the prosecution from having to present their case and saving time for all parties involved. While the sentence is yet to be determined, the charge of drink-driving holds severe consequences. This case serves as a stark reminder to railway professionals of the perils of operating any motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. The staff member at Manchester Piccadilly station played a crucial role in preventing a potentially hazardous situation. Had they not been diligent and observant, Felicity Hall would have been operating a train carrying numerous passengers while being impaired by alcohol, increasing the risk of accidents or negligence-related incidents. Conclusion: This unfortunate incident has highlighted the importance of constant vigilance when it comes to passenger and staff safety within the railway industry. The swift action of the staff member at Manchester Piccadilly railway station showcases how individuals can work together to create a more secure travel environment, ensuring public transport remains a safe and reliable means of getting around. Felicity Hall's case is not an isolated one, and it is essential for everyone within the railway sector to be well-educated on the risks of drink-driving and the potential harm that such behavior can cause, both to innocent passengers and fellow colleagues. Having an open conversation about the challenges and consequences of such actions can help to prevent such incidents in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: Salesmen in shirts with an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin wait for customers at GUM (the State Department Store) in Moscow, Russia, Monday, Oct. 6, 2014. Souvenirs and clothing featuring Putin... (Associated Press) MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin is celebrating his 62nd birthday in the wilderness of Siberia as supporters from across Russia create tributes in his honor. Putin celebrated his birthday Tuesday in the Siberian forest some \\"300-400 kilometers (185-250 miles) from the nearest populated area,\\" his press secretary told Russian news media. Putin has often brandished his tough-guy image with widely publicized wilderness romps during which he hunts, fishes or rides horses — often while shirtless. In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, thousands carried a 600-meter-long (650 yards) Russian flag through the streets. Others dressed in the red, white and blue of the Russian tricolor walked through the streets as an enormous human flag, many of them holding portraits of the Russian leader over their heads. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's president, wrote on his official Instagram account that there were 100,000 participants. Russian news websites published photographs from a one-day exhibition in Moscow titled \\"The 12 Labors of Vladimir Putin,\\" in which Putin is depicted as Hercules — battling Western nations disguised as serpents and monsters or taming an ox bearing the symbol of Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in March. Putin's always-high ratings have skyrocketed this year as he responded to a pro-European uprising in Ukraine by seizing Crimea, and reacted defiantly to Western sanctions. His approval rating remains at 86 percent according to the independent Levada Center, which conducted a poll in September with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent. Souvenirs decorated with Putin's face have become best-sellers on Red Square, while Russian designers have made him the theme of pricey T-shirts and sweaters. Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, congratulated Putin on his birthday and said his tenure in office had become \\"an integral part of national history.\\" However, as the value of the ruble sinks under pressure from sanctions, some online commentators were less enthusiastic: \\"The dollar is 40 (rubles), the Euro is 50 (rubles), and Putin is 62,\\" was one joke that spread across the web. ___ Musa Sadulayev in Grozny, Chechnya contributed reporting. ||||| Photo: Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images For his birthday, President Obama only got a photo essay of the past year’s events posted to the White House website. Russian president Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, got a whole exhibition comparing him to the Greek mythical hero Heracles (known further west as Hercules). No joke — it’s called “The 12 Labors of Putin.” The exhibit was held on Monday by members of a pro-Putin Facebook group in Moscow’s “Red October” showspace, formerly the site of a chocolate factory by the same name. Putin turns 62 on Tuesday. “Interestingly, the events of the ancient legends about the mythological hero Hercules can be relayed onto our days, when the three-headed dog Cerberus reminds us of the USA, annihilation of the Stymphalian Birds — of stopping the air raids in Syria and the cleaning of the Augean stables is fighting corruption,” the organizers wrote on Facebook, apparently in earnest. The organizer at the event itself appeared to be a young, bearded man named Mikhail Antonov, whose T-shirt was almost obscured by his blazer. Almost, but not quite — it appeared to read “Vladimir Putin” and have a thumbs-up sign underneath. куратор выставки о подвигах Путина pic.twitter.com/uzoQT4pfgk — Feldman (@EvgenyFeldman) October 6, 2014 He said that members of the Facebook group often sent in artwork depicting the president, and they decided to do a thematic show for the leader’s birthday.

An 11-year-old girl with leukemia whose mother removed her from a hospital while she still had a catheter in her heart is 'getting better,' according to her mother. 'She's happy. She's getting better,' Emily Bracamontes' mother told NBC's Today Show in her first interview since she removed Emily from Phoenix Children's Hospital so she could take her to Mexico to continue her care. Emily had been receiving chemotherapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital for a month when her mother Norma removed an IV drip from her arm, changed her clothes and walked her out of the facility two weeks ago. Scroll down for videos. Speaking out: 11-year-old Emily Bracamontes, who is sick with leukemia, says she's 'happy' her mother removed from a Phoenix hospital two weeks ago so she could continue her care in Mexico. Claims: 'She's happy. She's getting better,' Emily Bracamontes' mother told NBC's Today Show in her first interview since removing Emily from Phoenix Children's Hospital. 'I'm happy that I'm going back home. to see my doctors in Mexico,' Emily, wearing a bright pink hat, told. NBC. 'My mom's only trying to save my life,' she added. 'She doesn't. want me to die in a hospital. So I was happy that she took that. decision.' Emily's parents say they felt pressured over health care insurance and mounting costs at the Phoenix hospital. They also claimed that their daughter, who contracted an infection at. the hospital that led to her arm being amputated, was 'threatened and. intimidated' by doctors there. But Emily's doctors in Phoenix are concerned that the decision to remove. her - especially with the catheter still her in heart - could endanger. her life.

Question: Question: What did Angier use the machine to create? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Prestige Context: The Prestige begins with shots of several dozen top hats inexplicably strewn about in a forest.Cutter (Michael Caine), in voiceover, explains the three parts of a magic trick while performing a disappearing bird trick for a little girl. Part one is the pledge, where the magician shows you something ordinary, like a bird. Part two is the turn, where he does something extraordinary, like make the bird disappear. But this isn't enough. There always has to be a third act, the prestige, where you have a twist, and bring the bird back. Only then will the audience applaud.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), stage name \\"the Great Danton,\\" attempts a transporting trick that involves walking under a giant electrical machine with a Tesla coil and then disappearing through a trapdoor. Except that he falls straight into a giant tank of water that has been placed under the stage, and is automatically locked inside. A man in the audience, who we shortly learn is fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), stage name \\"the Professor,\\" forces his way beneath the stage in time to see Angier drown.After this introduction, we follow three timelines at once. In the present day (19th century England), Borden is on trial for murdering Angier, who we learn was his greatest rival. Cutter is revealed to be Angier's engineer, the man who builds the machinery for his tricks, and the little girl is Borden's daughter Jess (Samantha Mahurin).Cutter confides to the judge in a private meeting that the machine Angier was using wasn't built by him, but by \\"a wizard,\\" and it legitimately did what it appeared to do.The trial does not go well for Borden, and he faces execution. Later, in jail, Borden is approached by the solicitor for a collector, Lord Caldlow, who is interested in buying his secrets, particularly the secret of Borden's famous \\"Transported Man\\" trick. The same collector has also bought all of Angier's equipment and props. When Borden refuses, the solicitor threatens that Jess is in danger of being declared an indigent orphan and... Answer:","completion":"In the movie The Prestige, Angier (Hugh Jackman) uses a machine to create duplicates of himself in order to perform a seemingly impossible magic trick called the \\"Transported Man.\\" The machine was built by Nikola Tesla, a real-life inventor, and electrical engineer, who is portrayed by David Bowie in the film. In the \\"Transported Man\\" trick, Angier disappears on one side of the stage and instantly reappears on the other side. However, instead of merely creating the illusion of transport, the machine that Tesla had built actually worked by creating a duplicate of Angier. One Angier would go through the trapdoor and into a tank of water below the stage, where he would drown. Simultaneously, the duplicate Angier would appear on the other side of the stage, thus completing the trick and receiving applause from the audience. Angier's use of the machine to create duplicates of himself is an essential plot point in The Prestige, as it drives the intense rivalry between him and fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). The competition between the two magicians escalates, leading to Angier framing Borden for his own murder by drowning, which eventually results in Borden's execution. In the end, it is revealed that Borden also had a \\"prestige\\" of his own - he had a secret twin brother, who had helped him perform their version of the \\"Transported Man\\" trick. Ultimately, Angier's obsession with besting his rival and achieving the perfect magic trick leads to tragic consequences for both magicians. As they continually try to outdo each other, their lives become entangled with deceit, loss, and revenge. The Prestige serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition and obsession, as well as the power of secrets in the art of illusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the first name of the person who was not formally trained but gifted? Answer the above question based on the context below: At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention.

On Saturday, a barge carrying 900,000 gallons of oil collided with ship in the Houston Ship Channel, spilling nearly 170,000 gallons of thick oil across the busy waterway and closing it down. More crews arrived on Monday to skim oil from the surface of the water and place protective booms along the shore. Environmental groups fear that an important shorebird habitat 45 miles southeast of Houston could be hit. Company that owns barge is taking responsibility for the spill and its clear up costs. The disaster comes 25 years after an Exxon oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons of oil into the water at Prince William Sound, Alaska; two decades on and the area is still largely affected by the pollution. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Oil Spill Threatens Shorebird Habitat and Shuts Down Houston Ship Channel On Saturday, a disastrous event struck the Houston Ship Channel, as a barge carrying a staggering 900,000 gallons of oil met with a catastrophic collision with a ship. This unfortunate occurrence led to the spillage of approximately 170,000 gallons of dense, viscous oil all across the bustling waterway, forcing it to shut down, much to the chagrin of those who depended on it for their livelihood. Monday saw an influx of additional crews, who were sent to the scene to skim the oil from the surface of the water and place protective booms along the shoreline in an attempt to prevent further environmental damage. The focus of this cleanup effort resulted from fears expressed by various environmental groups concerning the welfare of a vital shorebird habitat located approximately 45 miles southeast of Houston. The company that owns the barge has come forward to accept responsibility for the grievous spill and will shoulder the costs associated with the cleanup operation. In the meantime, comparisons have been drawn to the infamous Exxon oil tanker disaster that occurred 25 years ago, during which 11 million gallons of oil were spilled into the waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska. To this day, that area still feels the profound and lasting effects of the pollution that came about as a result of this incident. While the Houston Ship Channel spill may not be as extensive as the Exxon case, it remains a solemn reminder of the potential hazards posed by humanity's reliance on oil and the transportation methods used to carry it around the globe. Moving forward, it is essential to diligently monitor the situation in the Houston area, particularly as it pertains to the ecological impact on the shorebird habitat and the overall wellbeing of the marine ecosystem. Additionally, the disruption caused by the channel's closure will inevitably have economic implications, and the swiftest return to normalcy should be pursued by the responsible company's reparation efforts. In conclusion, the oil spill in the Houston Ship Channel represents not just an isolated accident, but a crucial reminder of the environmental and economic consequences that go hand in hand with the oil industry. Society's ongoing endeavours to find more efficient and less hazardous transportation methods, as well as cleaner alternative energy sources, remain paramount in mitigating the likelihood of future disasters on this scale. This incident serves as a stark cautionary tale—a serious call to action for corporations and governments alike—to safeguard the precious natural resources at stake, all around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this: Several churches and monasteries were built inside, or close to, the city of Utrecht. The most dominant of these was the Cathedral of Saint Martin, inside the old Roman fortress. The construction of the present Gothic building was begun in 1254 after an earlier romanesque construction had been badly damaged by fire. The choir and transept were finished from 1320 and were followed then by the ambitious Dom tower. The last part to be constructed was the central nave, from 1420. By that time, however, the age of the great cathedrals had come to an end and declining finances prevented the ambitious project from being finished, the construction of the central nave being suspended before the planned flying buttresses could be finished. Besides the cathedral there were four collegiate churches in Utrecht: St. Salvator's Church (demolished in the 16th century), on the Dom square, dating back to the early 8th century. Saint John (Janskerk), originating in 1040; Saint Peter, building started in 1039 and Saint Mary's church building started around 1090 (demolished in the early 19th century, cloister survives). Besides these churches the city housed St. Paul's Abbey, the 15th-century beguinage of St. Nicholas, and a 14th-century chapter house of the Teutonic Knights.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

Hooker Brown has played twice since his return from injury, while scrum-half Pyrgos was back in action on Sunday. Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hailed the performance of Pyrgos in the 27-20 win over Cardiff Blues in the Pro12. \\"I thought Henry Pyrgos was outstanding,\\" he told BBC Scotland. \\"To be out of the game for four months and really add tempo to our game, make the right decisions of where to attack and the players followed him and we got a couple of cracking tries in there.\\" Cowan and Maitland will be notable absentees from the Scotland squad that will gather on Tuesday at Murrayfield ahead of Sunday's Six Nations game against France. Loose forward Cowan missed the victory over Italy through concussion, while winger Maitland dropped out of the squad with a thigh injury. Both returned to London Irish for treatment but were deemed fit enough to play in the 47-20 defeat by Leicester in the English Premiership, a game that took place 24 hours after Scotland's win in Rome. However, Scotland coach Vern Cotter has decided against recalling either player after the likes Ryan Wilson and Tim Visser, who had returned to the squad after recovering from their own injuries, took their chance to impress. Dunbar, Pyrgos and Brown had missed the start of the tournament through injury. Pygos, who captained Scotland for the first time last year in the absence of Greig Laidlaw, had wrist surgery after picking up his injury in October.

Question: How many chopping blows does it take to kill Doyle? Movie title: Sling Blade Movie plot: Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton) is an intellectually disabled Arkansas man who has been in the custody of the state mental hospital since the age of 12 for having killed his mother and her lover. Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle. Karl is haunted by the task given to him by his parents when he was six or eight years old to dispose of his premature, unwanted, newborn brother. He visits his father (Robert Duvall), who has become a mentally unbalanced hermit living in the dilapidated home...","completion":"In the movie \\"Sling Blade\\" directed by Billy Bob Thornton, the character Doyle Hargraves is portrayed as an abusive, alcoholic boyfriend to Linda, Frank's mother. Doyle is a source of distress and discomfort for both Linda and her son, Frank. The main character of the movie, Karl Childers, who is intellectually disabled, does end up killing Doyle but not without significant consequences both morally and legally. The decision to kill Doyle is one that Karl doesn't take lightly. It is informed by his deep affection for Linda and Frank, and his desire to protect them from Doyle's abuse. The act itself is accomplished using the same type of weapon that was used earlier in the film and mentioned in your film proposal, the \\"Kaiser blade\\" or as Karl calls it, the \\"sling blade.\\" Remember, Karl is no stranger to the violent use of such implements, having already killed his mother and her lover when he was younger. In terms of the number of blows it took to kill Doyle, the film isn't explicitly clear. The scene is highly intense and emotionally charged, and doesn't focus on the gory details. Karl viciously swings the blade, perhaps multiple times, until Doyle is dead. The act is not valorized; it is portrayed as gruesome and devastating. So, as an investor, you may want to consider the impact this violent scene and the overarching theme of violence might have on potential audiences. On the one hand, the intensity of these scenes might be off-putting to some. However, others might appreciate the exploration of complex themes such as morality, mental illness, and the lengths one might go to protect those they care about. You should also consider the performances by notable actors like Billy Bob Thornton and Dwight Yoakam, which may draw in audiences out of appreciation for their work. Be sure to weigh these factors carefully, knowing that the ultimate return on investment would depend on the film’s market acceptance and performance, beyond the obscurity of how many blows were needed for Karl to kill Doyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When medics arrived, they couldn't say whether or not Teka's unusual version of CPR had any effect, but her owner feels grateful to her.And her efforts didn't go unnoticed: Teka was given a Purple Cross medal for bravery by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Zoey Size is no barrier to a dog determined to protect her family and Zoey, a 5-pound chihuahua puppy from Colorado, is living proof. She made headlines in 2007 after saving a one-year-old from the bite of a large rattlesnake. Zoey, who weighed only five pounds, was just 10 months old at the time, but she rose to the occasion when needed.One-year-old Booker West was playing in his grandparent's backyard when a rattlesnake struck at him! Zoey sprang into action, putting herself between the snake and the kid.She got several snakebites and was rushed to an animal hospital.Her head swelled and she almost lost an eye, but with proper treatment, Zoey made a full recovery. Hachiko Hachiko, an Akita, was brought to Tokyo in 1924 by Ueno, a college professor. Every day Hachiko waited for him to return from work, meeting him at the train station at four.

Upon his death in 1935, Hachiko was a national celebrity and a bronze statue of him was installed at Shibuya Station as a tribute. Stubby In 1917 Stubby was adopted by a soldier, who trained him to drill and salute. His owner developed such a strong connection with him that when he was sent to war in Europe, he took Stubby along, hiding him on the ship bound for France. Stubby proved a war star.He served 18 months in the front lines and took part in seventeen battles.He kept watch, warned the soldiers of surprise attacks, and saved the wounded in no man's land.He once found a German spy and held him by the seat of the pants until American soldiers arrived.

The presence of more coal miners would only increase the availability of coal as an alternative fuel source but wouldn't directly affect the heating properties of oil.

A local state of emergency has been declared in a western Manitoba municipality after homes in Ochre Beach were destroyed and seriously damaged by a wave of lake ice. Area officials told CBC News the wind pushed built-up ice off Dauphin Lake on Friday evening and caused it to pile up in the community, located on the lake's southern shore. The piles of ice, which were more than nine metres tall in some cases, destroyed at least six homes and cottages, according to the Rural Municipality of Ochre River. Another 14 homes suffered extensive damage, with some structures knocked off their foundations. Clayton Watts, Ochre River's deputy reeve, said it's a miracle no one was hurt. He told CBC News one minute people were watching hockey in their living rooms, the next they heard something that sounded like a freight train near their homes. \\"It happened so quick,\\" said Watts. \\"And you can't predict it — not like water that slowly comes up.\\" Watts said there are several cabins that were completely flattened by the wall of ice that came at them. \\"The ice is over top of them, they've been crushed, there's nothing left,\\" he said. \\"There are other cabins that have been knocked right off their footings,\\" he continued. \\"There's ice right over top of some of the cabins, coming over the roof on the other side.\\" According to Environment Canada winds were registered at about 80 km/h in the area Friday night. No insurance coverage for ice damage Dennis Stykalo, whose cottage is full of ice after Friday night's wind storm, told CBC News his insurance does not cover damage done by ice. He said he's devastated after the event — he can't even get inside to recover his valuables. \\"You know you've got cement, concrete blocks, and steel and the ice goes through it like its just a toothpick,\\" said Stykalo. \\"It just shows the power. There is nothing you can do, you just get out of the way and just watch.\\" CBC News also contacted an insurance company in Winnipeg who said generally coverage is not provided for damage to homes caused by shoreline ice build up or water-borne ice. Same area hit by flood in 2011 The damage is even more traumatic for some, he added, as many of the homes in the area were ruined by flooding in 2011. Dozens of properties in Ochre Beach and Dauphin Beach were evacuated due to extremely high lake levels that spring. \\"They're devastated. Most of these people were hit pretty hard during the flood,\\" said Watts. \\"Most of them were just back to the stage where they were back living in their homes again. And now this has happened. So they're pretty devastated right now.\\" Ochre Beach is about 300 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg and 20 kilometres east of Dauphin. ||||| Hey there, time traveller!

Then the volunteers cometh. 730 CKDM 730 CKDM 730 CKDM Ice from Dauphin Lake smashed into this home at Ochre Beach Friday. About 23 homes were destroyed and 27 affected. No injuries were reported. Hundreds of local residents arrived by the dozens on Saturday with backhoes and bulldozers and wheelbarrows — helping to chip away massive ice floes that on Friday night destroyed 12 homes and damaged another 15 along Ochre Beach, located 20 kilometres east of Dauphin. \\"Today was just a work day,\\" RM of Ochre River deputy reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday night. \\"They got a lot done. They had an unbelievable amount of people working out there; all kinds of friends and people from around other beaches.\\" Or total strangers. \\"Everybody was pitching in to help them (residents) make it through the day,\\" Watts said. \\"It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just helps out.\\" According to provincial Emergency Measures Organization officials, a total of seven permanent homes were literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes from Lake Dauphin around supper time on Friday, pushed by north winds gusting up to 60 kilometres per hour. Doug Davis had just taken a shower and was about to sit down on his couch and relax at his home along Ochre Beach on Friday night. Then he heard the ice coming. \\"All of a sudden,\\" said Davis’s wife, Elaine, \\"that was it.\\" Within the next five minutes, a wall of ice rose from the lake so powerful that it plowed though the Davis’s two-storey home, pushing furniture from one bedroom into another. It pushed the bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway. The Davis family wasn’t alone. In all, 27 homes and cottages were damaged or destroyed – although no injuries were reported. A local state of emergency was declared in the municipality, and residents along the beach were evacuated on Friday night. The provincial Emergency Social Services were called to the scene Friday night to assist residents in finding temporary lodging. Structural experts from the Office of the Fire Commissioner were also on hand to determine whether some residents could be allowed to attempt clean up or collect belongings. On Saturday, the residents and volunteers were allowed to return to the area and begin digging the ice on homes that were declared structurally stable. All for a natural event that was over in just 15 minutes. \\"They (homeowners) heard it before they saw it (the ice) coming up their decks,\\" Watts said. \\"Then it came right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no one was hurt. We were very lucky.\\" On Saturday morning, Watts was standing on an adjacent beach, looking over the damage. \\"The ice is up taller than the cottages and homes,\\" he said. \\"It kind of dwarfs them.\\" \\"This is nothing you can predict,\\" Watts said. \\"Water, you can see it coming up. There’s nothing you can do to prevent this. Sometimes, it’s just the luck of the way the wind is blowing. You can just hope for the best, and the best was no one got hurt.\\" However, Watts said many of the cottagers and home owners affected by the ice wave were also just recovering from severe flooding in 2011. In fact, a few of the homes were newly constructed. \\"That’s what’s so devastating,\\" he said. \\"These people have rebuilt their homes and got their lives back together. Now they have to start over again.\\" In fact, the Davis’s were just in the process of seeking out contractors to rebuild the foundation of their home, due to lingering flood damage. Instead, on Saturday morning, Elaine was surveying an entirely different dilemma. \\"We’re looking at a front room filled ice and we’re trying to shovel it out,\\" she said. \\"There are huge chunks. It breaks my heart to see our house....everybody’s houses. The feeling is indescribable. She’s gone. \\"But you salvage what you can. There’s not much a person can do. You just have to take a deep breath and do what you have to do.\\" Davis was even more concerned about weather reports on Saturday that high winds were being predicted this weekend. \\"Mother nature’s not done with us yet,\\" she said. \\"You never know.\\" However, on Saturday night, the winds had begun to die down, Watts said. randy.turner@freepress.mb.ca ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A local state of emergency was declared in Ochre Beach, a western Manitoba municipality, after homes were destroyed and seriously damaged by a wave of lake ice.

Article: A few years ago, pop poets such as Murray Lachlan Young began to set poetry to rock music with some surprising results. People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse Erato is pictured with a lyre in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that _ . - there is more rhythm in pop songs than poetry - pop songs are more difficult to understand than poetry - some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again - pop songs are not always performed before audience","completion":"According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shenouda endured more than three years of exile in the 1980s but later rarely fought with Mubarak's regime [EPA] Egypt's Coptic Pope Shenouda III, the leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority, has died at 88, state television and church sources said. The cause of death was not immediately clear, but for years Shenouda had suffered from back and liver problems, and health issues forced him to cancel his weekly sermon on Wednesday. Named pope in 1971, Shenouda led the Coptic Orthodox Church through 40 years of quiet expansion, including a strong growth in North America, but came under criticism in his native Egypt during the later years of his papacy. Most of the church's more than 10 million members are in Egypt, where Copts are believed to make up around 10 per cent of the population. For most Egyptian Copts, Shenouda was the only spiritual leader they have ever known, a beloved figure who nonetheless became controversial for rarely opposing a government that was often accused of promoting Muslims' rights over those of Copts. Naguib Sawiris, a liberal Coptic Christian political leader and billionaire telecommunications tycoon, wrote on Twitter that Shenouda had been \\"an icon of wisdom, intellect and knowledge, a man of courage and honour\\". Exile and return Shenouda, who worked as a journalist before spending years as a monk and being elected pope, entered his tenure with a political agenda, set on reforming the church from within, Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros reported from Cairo. In the 1980s, Shenouda spent more than three years in exile in a desert monastery after former president Anwar Sadat stripped him of his powers by decree. At the time, Shenouda had been pressing for more rights for the Coptic community and trying to preserve his congregation from escalating attacks by Muslim extremists. Former president Hosni Mubarak canceled Sadat's decree in 1985, and Shenouda returned to lead Christmas Mass before a crowd of thousands in Cairo's St Mark's Cathedral. After returning, Shenouda oversaw the growth of the church in the United States and South America. He emphasised Christian unity and dialogue between churches throughout the world. 'Beloved children' In recent years, some Egyptian Copts had begun to express criticism of Shenouda for not speaking out on Coptic rights, particularly as sectarian violence seemed to increase. \\"It was really after the former president Hosni Mubarak then took power that you saw a more cordial relationship ... and at that point people began to criticize the pope,\\" Tadros said. Although Shenouda gave limited praise to Egypt's revolution, he often encouraged protesters to go home, both before and after Mubarak's fall, and he pleaded for stability. The later part of his papacy was marked by co-operation with Mubarak and, after the revolt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. When sectarian clashes began to erupt after Mubarak's removal, including church burnings throughout the country, Shenouda praised the military leadership for helping to rebuild. But in October, when soldiers brutally dispersed a Coptic protest outside state media headquarters, leaving at least 26 people dead, Shenouda declared that those killed were martyrs and blamed the military for the violence. \\"These martyrs are our beloved children and their blood does not come cheap,\\" he said. \\"I, along with all the bishops, priests and monks, will pray for them. And we know that God will forgive their sins.\\" ||||| Image caption Pope Shenouda III led Egypt's Coptic Christian church for more than three decades Egypt's Coptic Christian Pope Shenouda III has died at the age of 88, state television has announced. The leader of the Middle East's largest Christian minority was reported to suffer from cancer that had spread to several organs. Coptic Christians make up 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million. After attacks on Coptic Christians in recent years, Pope Shenouda urged officials to do more to address the community's concerns. Pope Shenouda led the church, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, for four decades. His political adviser Hany Aziz told Reuters news agency that Shenouda \\"died from complications in health and from old age\\". He had returned recently to Egypt after seeking treatment abroad. Pope Shenouda was born Nazeer Gayed into a devout Christian family on 3 August 1923 in Asyut, Upper Egypt, and became a monk in 1954, taking the name Shenouda. After Pope Cyril died in 1971, Shenouda was enthroned as Pope of Alexandria. He fell out with President Anwar Sadat, who in 1981 sent him into internal exile. He was allowed back to Cairo by President Hosni Mubarak four years later. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says Pope Shenouda sought to protect his Christian community amid a Muslim population by striking a conservative tone and lending tacit support to President Mubarak's rule. Whoever succeeds him now faces the task of reassuring the Coptic community as the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood look on the verge of sharing power in Egypt for the first time, our correspondent says. Many younger Copts will now be looking for a leader who can help redefine their community's role in a rapidly changing post-Mubarak Egypt, our correspondent adds. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Pope Shenouda III, the leader of Egypt's Coptic Christian Church and the largest Christian minority in the Middle East, passed away at age 88.

On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. But I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... What is an answer for this question: Would Kettle Foods potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo'? Answer:","completion":"Kettle Foods potatoes would likely be less herbicide tolerant than PepsiCo's potatoes. This is because Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers, while PepsiCo supplies GMO potato seeds. GMO crops, such as those used by PepsiCo, often have enhanced traits such as herbicide tolerance, allowing them to withstand exposure to herbicides without being harmed. In contrast, non-GMO crops, like those used by Kettle Foods, have not been genetically modified for such traits and may be more susceptible to damage from herbicides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Revenge may be all in the anticipation \\"Sweet is revenge,\\" Lord Byron wrote in \\"Don Juan\\" â and how could it be otherwise? Who wouldn't enjoy getting even with a sadistic boss, a two-faced friend who slept with your spouse or that teacher who had it in for your child for no good reason? Most of us have revenge fantasies, human behavior researchers say, and nearly everyone believes that punishing someone who did him wrong would feel tremendously satisfying. But new studies suggest the reality of revenge is far different. Acting on vengeful thoughts often isn't nearly as gratifying as expected and â surprisingly â can even make people feel worse. Still, the delicious pleasure anticipated from taking revenge is such a powerful drive that it appears to be hard-wired in the brain. University of Zurich scientists found that merely contemplating revenge stimulates a region of the brain called the dorsal striatum, which is known to become active in anticipation of a reward or pleasure, such as making money or eating good food. In the study, 14 volunteers earned money if they cooperated with one another in games. A double-crosser pretended to cooperate but secretly took an unfair share of the cash. Victims could retaliate by imposing a fine on the betrayer, though they sometimes had to spend their own money to carry out the punishment. All 14 volunteers chose to retaliate if they could do so at no charge, and 12 out of 14 did so even if it cost them additional money. When they decided to seek revenge, the dorsal striatum lighted up on a PET scan. Those whose brains were activated the most were willing to spend the most to punish the double-crosser, notes study co-author Ernst Fehr, whose research was published in Science in 2004. It's not surprising that our brains signal \\"pleasure\\" at the prospect of punishing someone who wronged us, says Michael McCullough, a University of Miami psychologist and author of \\"Beyond Revenge: The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct.\\" Although it can be a misguided, costly craving in the modern world, evolutionary psychologists believe the thirst for revenge ensured our ancestors' survival â retaliation was the only way for victims to deter aggressors from harming them or their tribes in the future. \\"Revenge burrowed into the brain's reward system â it hitched a ride on our neurons â because it really was effective at deterring future harm,\\" says McCullough, who notes that revenge is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios? The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

An open-topped motorcar pulls up near the Jallianwala Bagh, a seven-acre area of waste ground, and Brigadier Reginald ‘Rex’ Dyer steps out. He then attempts to bring an armoured car, with its machine gun, into the area, but is foiled because the street is too narrow. No matter, he orders his force of Indian and Gurkha troops to open fire into a peaceful crowd of local men, women and children who are listening to Gandhian speeches about non-violence.

In just ten minutes, nearly 400 people are dead and more than a thousand injured – the exact numbers are unknown due to the chaos caused by Dyer's actions. The Amritsar Massacre, as it came to be known, leaves a deep scar on the Indian psyche and marks a crucial turning point in the struggle for Indian independence. Public outrage at the brutality of Dyer's actions is felt not only in India but also across Britain and the world. The massacre becomes a symbol of British imperialism's ruthlessness and strengthens the resolve of Indians to fight for their freedom. In response to the massacre, Mahatma Gandhi intensifies his nonviolent resistance campaign, which ultimately leads to India gaining independence in 1947. Yet, despite the global condemnation and subsequent investigation into the Amritsar Massacre, the British government has never issued a formal apology. Decades later, while visiting the Golden temple in Amritsar, then Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledges the atrocities as 'monstrous,' but falls short of giving an official apology. As we approach the centenary of this tragic event, the debate over whether Britain should finally apologize for the Amritsar Massacre continues. Supporters argue that offering an apology would be a significant gesture towards healing historical wounds, while skeptics question the purpose such an apology would serve today. Regardless of where one stands on this issue, the Amritsar Massacre remains a poignant reminder of the human capacity for cruelty and the importance of never forgetting our history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Theodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (\\"Theodros II Doukas Laskaris\\") (1221/1222 August 18, 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258. - Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages in mainland Europe, the Mediterranean world, and the Middle East. The development of the periodization has generally been accredited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work \\"The World of Late Antiquity\\" (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. 235 284) to, in the East, the early Islamic period (7th9th centuries), following the Muslim conquests in the mid7th century. In the West the end was earlier, with the start of the Early Medieval period typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the Western edges of the empire. - A capital city (or simply capital) is the municipality exercising primary status in a country, state, province, or other region, usually as its seat of government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. - Constantine the Great (27 February 272 AD 22 May 337 AD), also known as Constantine I or Saint Constantine (in the Orthodox Church as Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles), was a Roman Emperor from 306 to 337 AD. Constantine was the son of Flavius Valerius Constantius, a Roman Army officer, and his consort Helena. His father became \\"Caesar\\", the deputy emperor in the west, in 293 AD. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors Diocletian and Galerius. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of \\"Augustus\\", senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in Britannia (Britain). Acclaimed as emperor by the army at Eboracum (modern-day York) after his father's death in 306 AD, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324 AD. - The Count of Flanders was the ruler or sub-ruler of the county of Flanders, beginning in the 9th century. The title was held for a time by the Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain. During the French Revolution in 1790, the county of Flanders was annexed to France and the peerage ceased to exist. In the 19th century, the title was appropriated by Belgium and granted twice to younger sons of the King of the Belgians. The most recent holder died in 1983. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - The Empire of Romania, more commonly known in historiography as the Latin Empire or Latin Empire of Constantinople, and known to the Byzantines as the Latin Occupation, was a feudal Crusader state founded by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade on lands captured from the Byzantine Empire. It was established after the capture of Constantinople in 1204 and lasted until 1261. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Roman Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. Baldwin IX, Count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor as Baldwin I on 16 May 1204. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline. Weakened by constant warfare with the Bulgarians and the unconquered sections of the empire, it eventually fell when Byzantines recaptured Constantinople under Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, consisting of the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Originally formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. - The Empire of Nicaea was the largest of the three Byzantine Greek successor states founded by the aristocracy of the Byzantine Empire that fled after Constantinople was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the Fourth Crusade. Founded by the Laskaris family, it lasted from 1204 to 1261, when the Nicaeans restored the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople. - The Fall of Constantinople ('; Conquest of Istanbul) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading army of the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by the then 21-year-old Mehmed the Conqueror, the seventh sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. - Alexios Komnenos Strategopoulos ( Greek : ) was a Byzantine general during the reign of Michael VIII Palaiologos , rising to the rank of megas domestikos and Caesar . Of noble descent , he appears in the sources already at an advanced age in the early 1250s , leading armies for the Empire of Nicaea against Epirus . After falling out of favour and being imprisoned by Theodore II Laskaris , Strategopoulos sided with the aristocrats around Michael Palaiologos , and supported him in his rise to the throne after Theodore II 's death in 1258 . He participated in the Pelagonia campaign in 1259 , going on to capture Epirus , but his successes were undone in the next year and he was captured by the Epirotes . Released after a few months , he led the unexpected reconquest of Constantinople from the Latin Empire in July 1261 , restoring the Byzantine Empire . He was captured again by the Epirotes in the next year and spent several years in captivity in Italy , before being released . He retired from public affairs and died in the early 1270s . - Michael VIII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (\\"Mikhal VIII Palaiologos\\"; 1223 11 December 1282) reigned as Byzantine Emperor 12591282. Michael VIII was the founder of the Palaiologan dynasty that would rule the Byzantine Empire until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. He recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire in 1261 and transformed the Empire of Nicaea into a restored Byzantine Empire. - Istanbul (or ), historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural, and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city. - The Laskaris or Lascaris family was a Byzantine Greek noble family whose members formed the ruling dynasty of the Empire of Nicaea from 1204 to 1261 and remained among the senior nobility up to the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire, whereupon many emigrated to Italy and then to Smyrna (much later). According to George Pachymeres, they were also called Tzamantouros (T). The feminine form of the name is Laskarina (). - Komnenos, Latinized Comnenus, plural Komnenoi or Comneni (, pronounced /komniní/), is the name of a noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire from 1081 to 1185, and later, as the Grand Komnenoi (, \\"Megalokomnenoi\\") founded and ruled the Empire of Trebizond (12041461). Through intermarriages with other noble clans, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style.

Meet the biggest banjo maker in the U.S. FORTUNE — Before Taylor Swift, Steve Martin, and Mumford & Sons made it hip to strum a Deering banjo, Greg Deering made the instruments by hand in his garage, one at a time. His wife Janet would load the banjos into their station wagon and try to hawk them to L.A. music stores, which often said no to the upstart company. Even after landing accounts, they scrambled to pay their bills and struggled to shake off the image of banjo players as toothless hillbillies in overalls. At times, the Deerings wanted to give up. But they had a pact — they would make banjos no matter what. “We would say, ‘We can’t give up,'” says Janet Deering. “So let’s figure it out.” Did they ever. From that inauspicious start in 1975, the Deering Banjo Company of Spring Valley, Calif., has grown into North America’s largest banjo maker, riding the instrument’s current boom in popularity. The company owns an estimated 80% to 90% of the U.S. market and has almost doubled its sales since 2009, to a projected 5 million this year. In the past year alone, sales are up 1 million. In January, they expect to sell their one hundred-thousandth banjo. Instead of banging on music store doors, they have a one-year back order on new instruments. MORE: We need business leaders with some sense of shame Deering is not just the nation’s dominant banjo purveyor. It’s also a brand that’s attracting a new breed of young musicians. Taylor Swift strums a six-string, 2,100 model. “Taylor has really brought a lot of new people to the banjo,” Janet says. “Just watching her play, they buy banjos. It’s a wonderful thing.” Steve Martin, Keith Urban, and Winston Marshall of Mumford & Sons are all Deering banjo players too. The current roster of A-list musicians playing a Deering represents a 180-degree turn from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when Nashville shunned the banjo. Zen Crook, an old-time Nashville session player, told a company official how a fellow musician warned him, “Don’t let anyone know you play the banjo because it will be the kiss of death of your music career.” The Deerings say the banjo backlash hurt them early on. “We felt like we couldn’t climb out of the box,” Janet says. “I had country artists say, ‘As soon as I cut a record with a banjo, they cut it from the album.'” Greg Deering credits Emily Robison of the Dixie Chicks. “They told Emily she couldn’t play the banjo, and she told them to stuff it,” he says. “She said, ‘Either I play the banjo, or we walk.'” She used an electric Deering banjo she bought at age 15. Keith Urban also widened the instrument’s appeal, recording with a Deering far from Nashville in his native Australia. From the time he was a kid listening to The Kingston Trio, Greg says he has always loved the banjo. “It’s a primitive sound,” he says. “It has a haunting quality to it.” Greg was a good banjo player, but he was a better craftsman who honed his skills building model airplanes with his father. In 1969, as a 19-year-old student at San Diego State University, he made his first banjo because he couldn’t afford the 700 Gibson banjo he longed for. He and his buddies, including Bob Taylor (who would go on to guitar-making fame) formed an instrument-making co-op called The American Dream. In 1974, the co-op closed. The next year, Greg and Janet, who met at church after she watched him play hymns, started the Deering Banjo Company. In the early, lean years, they would eat from their garden and chicken coop, scrounge for tools at a salvage yard, and rush to the bank to deposit any profits before their checks bounced. After they hired four employees, the neighbors complained, so they moved their operation to a small plant. Pricing was a challenge initially. Greg wanted to put as much value as possible into each banjo, but when Janet tried to sell a 175 model, store owners would ask, “What’s wrong with it? Why is it so cheap?” The next week, they raised the price to 275, and still the stores wouldn’t bite. Only after they raised the price to 375 did they start racking up orders. The Deerings now rely on a skilled workforce of 47 craftspeople, some of whom were carpenters and others who trained on the job. With fluctuations in sales, keeping a core crew posed a challenge. During the recent recession, Deering’s sales skidded from 3.4 million in 2007 to a low of 2.4 million in 2009. The company shrunk down to what the Deerings call an ” irreversible minimum” of 31 workers. “We spent two weeks with barely enough sales to make payroll,” Greg says. But they wanted to keep all their best employees, so they had everyone in the shop read a book about lean technologies called The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. They moved machinery to a central location so workers did not have to walk as far, and Greg developed new, more efficient machines. When sales picked up, they could produce banjos faster and for less. MORE: Japan: A haven for humanoid robots Deering’s current offerings span the market. Their entry-level 500 banjos compete with Chinese imports. They also make custom-made, high-end instruments such as the Banjosaurus, which features an intricate mural depicting dinosaur evolution on the neck. George Grove of the Kingston Trio plays it onstage when he is not lending it to the American Banjo Museum in Oklahoma City. Anyone who wants to fork over 60,000 can have one custom-built just like it. Often, it’s rich amateurs, not professional musicians, who spend tens of thousands on a banjo as a piece of art. To keep banjo fever hot, the Deerings advertise in magazines, on the radio, and even on the side of a bus, under the tagline “Relax and Enjoy the Sound. Play the Banjo.” The company has sponsored banjo giveaways through the Facebook page of the Celtic punk group The Dropkick Murphys. To register to win, people have to submit their email address. “Within minutes, we’ll get 10,000 to 15,000 emails,” Greg says. This fall, the Deerings traveled with Mumford & Sons, setting up a tent and giving free banjo lessons to 2,000 fans in two weeks. “Within 15 minutes, I can teach you to strum and play two songs,” Greg says. They also travel worldwide, visiting dealers in 11 countries, and sell to other countries online. Jamie Deering, the Deerings’ daughter, is in charge of artist relations and also travels with bands. She has been mentioned as a possible successor, but Greg says she doesn’t want to go through the decades of struggle she saw her parents endure. “In order for her to take over, we’re going to have things running really, really well,” Greg says. Besides, Greg, who is 63, and Janet, who is 59, say they have no plans to retire anytime soon. They ignore advice to take their company public or cash out. That, after all, would break their pact. “We just want to make banjos,” Greg says. “It’s all about the magic of the music and the magic of banjos.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Deering Banjo Company, which is the largest banjo maker in North America.

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.

Given the relationship between kinetic energy and temperature, we can infer that sandwich A had a higher temperature than sandwich B. When food is microwaved, the energy from the microwaves causes the molecules in the food to move faster, which in turn increases the kinetic energy and temperature of the food. Therefore, the higher temperature of sandwich A suggests that it absorbed more energy from the microwaves and was in the microwave for a longer period of time than sandwich B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know lots of women who skip breakfast , and they have a ton of different excuses for doing it . Some say they don't have time, others think they're \\"saving\\" calories , still others just don't like breakfast food . But the bottom line is that eating in the morning is very important when you're trying to lose weight. \\"Eating just about anything from 300 to 400 calories would be better than nothing at all,\\" says Katherine Brooking , R , D , who developed the super-easy eating plan for this year's \\"SELF CHALLENGE\\". And even pizza can be healthy if it's loaded with vegetables, and you stick to one small piece. Breakfast is one meal I never miss, and the same goes for most weight loss success stories. Research shows that eating breakfast keeps you from overeating later in the day. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that breakfast skippers have a bigger chance of gaining weight than those who regularly have a morning meal. So eat something in the morning, anything. I know plenty of friends who end up having no breakfast altogether, and have just coffee or orange juice.

News article: With New App, Facebook Harkens Back to Internet 1.0 Online chat rooms lured a generation onto the Internet in the 1990s and then faded in the age of social media. Now, the biggest social network wants to resurrect them – on your phone. Facebook said Thursday it is launching a standalone smartphone app called “Rooms,” a nostalgic throwback to Internet 1.0, updated for the mobile Web. The app is like an infinitely large house where users can create rooms for specific purposes, like discussing current events, planning exotic vacations or breeding yorkipoos. The posts, which can include photos or videos, appear in chronological order. Like Internet message boards, all posts in Rooms are public. But the creator of a room may limit who can contribute posts. Contributors can use pseudonyms. Rooms is the latest entry in Facebook’s strategy of building standalone apps independent of the social network itself. This year, it launched the news aggregator Paper, a photo-sharing product called Slingshot and a video-capture app called Hyperlapse. Rooms stands out because it encourages users to create longer-lasting content and participate in conversations. Some rooms may be silly or frivolous, but the app could become a place to discuss current events and breaking news. Every post in Rooms is tagged with a Web address, or URL, making it visible to search engines like Google . That’s an important feature because it links the mobile app to the desktop Web, opening the app’s contents to searches from personal computers. A room’s creator can turn off the web links and search features, making the room more private. But anyone who knows the location of the room can still visit it. Rooms was designed by Josh Miller, a 24-year-old Princeton dropout who co-founded the online-discussion site Branch and sold it to Facebook in January. Branch still operates. Miller said he met frequently with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg while honing the concept of Rooms. Despite Zuckerberg’s involvement, Miller stressed that the app is separate from Facebook. It won’t offer users suggestions on which rooms to join based on their Facebook friends. It doesn’t use the phone’s address book to build a network. It can’t share content with Facebook. Miller said he wants people to interact with people outside their social network. “We’re risking our growth,” Miller said, because the app won’t take advantage of Facebook’s massive audience of 1.3 billion regular users. A Facebook spokesman said Facebook does not identify the devices that use Rooms, so it won’t know whether a Rooms user is a Facebook user or who they are. But he said Facebook might consider doing so in the future to better understand who is using the app. That would allow Facebook to know the real name of Rooms participant using a pseudonym, for example, but the spokesman said Facebook would never share a user’s identity. To build Rooms, Miller said he turned himself into a historian of the Internet, calling the creators of popular Internet message boards to ask how they attracted participants. He researched ways to block “flamers,” or people who post offensive or off-topic content in a room. Miller also wanted to give users the ability to control the look and feel of their chat rooms, something that’s not common in mobile apps. People who create rooms can choose any background color and post customized images. Invitations to join a room use QR codes. People who follow the room can send the code to others. They can also print the invite, allowing anyone who scans the code with a phone camera to join the room. ______________________________________________________ For the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd Get breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Martin Brodeur was born on May 6, 1972, in Montreal. He was one of five children of Denis and Mireille Brodeur. Denis played in the 1956 Olympics for Team Canada and won a bronze medal. After his playing career, Denis was a longtime photographer for the Montreal Canadiens. After a year of success, the Devils were in the middle of the pack for most of the 1995-96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter in the All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He finished fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals. In the 1996-97 season, the Devils finished 3rd in the NHL. Brodeur was runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, was named to the All-Star team, and had the lowest goals against average by a goalie in almost 30 years, earning him the Jennings Trophy. He also had 10 shutouts and a .927 save percentage. On April 17, 1997, in the first game of a first-round playoff matchup against the Montreal Canadiens, Brodeur fired the puck the length of the ice and into the Canadiens' empty net to ensure a 5-2 victory. It was only the second time in NHL history that a goaltender had scored in the playoffs, and the fifth time overall. The Devils went on to win that series, but lost in the second round to the rival New York Rangers. The following year, Brodeur had 43 wins and 10 shutouts in the regular season. The Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eighth-seeded Ottawa Senators. Once again, Brodeur made the All-Star Team, finished as a runner-up for the Vezina Trophy, and won the Jennings Trophy. In the 1998-99 season, the Devils finished first in the Eastern Conference for the third straight year, with Brodeur winning 39 games. He was among the contenders for the Vezina Trophy and started in the All-Star game, making his fourth appearance. However, the Devils lost in the first round to the Penguins. It was Brodeur's worst playoff performance to date statistically, as he allowed 20 goals in seven games with an .856 save percentage. Did anything else notable happen during that season?","completion":"During the 1998-99 season, Martin Brodeur was a very good goalie. He helped his team, the Devils, finish first in the Eastern Conference for the third year in a row. He won 39 games, which is a lot, and people thought he might win a big award for goalies called the Vezina Trophy. He also played in a special game with other top players called the All-Star game.

If you were expecting much more dramatic results, then adjust your expectations so that you are not discouraged. Eat a maximum of 6 ounces of protein at mealtimes. Ideally, women should consume 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day, and men should consume 1,800 to 2,200 per day. If your weight loss has stalled, then try counting calories for a couple of days and see what is pushing you out of your acceptable calorie range. If you’re estimating, then you may be overeating. Make a new commitment to accurately counting the grams of net carbs that you eat each day. If you aren’t eating enough vegetables, then you may become constipated, which could increase the reading on the scale. Many sauces and condiments contain carbohydrates, so be sure to read your labels. Sometimes, dieters overdo their consumption of these products. If you skip a meal, then you will feel ravenous before your next meal. If you allow yourself to become extremely hungry, then you will have more difficulty gauging when you have eaten enough. Over-the-counter medications and some prescription medications can slow down weight loss. Stress causes your body to produce cortisol, a fat-storing hormone, which can deposit fat around your waist.

Article: The video, released through Isis’s official propaganda outlet al-Hayat Media, shows two men who it claims are “agents recruited by Russian intelligence” apparently being shot in the desert by a child who is thought to be around 10 years old. It comes just a day after another video showed a child aged around 14 apparently carrying out a suicide bombing in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin. A previous video showed a young boy who Isis claimed took part in a suicide bombing And while the apparent execution could not be independently verified, experts suggested that the increased use of children in the atrocities it films represented “a departure from past norms”, even by Isis standards. The new video is entitled “Uncovering an enemy within”, and has been published by the branch of Isis which specialises in making propaganda videos for an international audience. Including captions in Arabic and English, it claims the two men are “FSB agents”, offered money to “gather information about fighters and send the information to Russia”. After they are shown “confessing” to the camera, a separate part of the video shows the two men on their knees in the desert before a militant and a boy who can be no more than 10 years old. The militant says the men are now “in the custody of the lion cubs of the caliphate”, before the child steps forward and appears to shoot the men. The same child has appeared in previous Isis videos, and also features in a clip at the end of the most recent video that appears to have been shot some time earlier. Charlie Winter, a researcher for the anti-extremism thinktank Quilliam, said: “Whether it is real or staged, [Isis] used a young child in this video for the shock factor, and the shock factor alone. “Its propagandists have done it before – showing images of children training as soldiers and being kicked in the stomach in martial arts drills – but this latest video marks a departure from past norms.” The video comes amid increased speculation over the blurring of lines between disparate militant groups like Isis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), particularly in the wake of the Paris shootings. And while many social media users speculated as to whether the apparent execution was genuine, Isis supporters shared it as a warning to “you who sent spies”. One Isis-affiliated account under the name Abu Marthad al-Muhajir tweeted: “This is not al-Qaeda, this is the Islamic State, O you filthy stupid Marxists of Russia. This is your destiny.” ||||| LONDON -- A video released Tuesday by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) shows the apparent execution of two men, accused of being spies for Russia, at the hands of a young boy. The seven-and-a-half-minute long video was released by ISIS' multi-lingual production wing, al-Hayat, and begins with long television news-style interviews with both men, who confess to being spies against ISIS and working in both Syria and Turkey. The men, who speak Russian in the interviews, are identified by name as agents of Russia's premier spy agency, the FSB. One of them tells the interviewer he was under orders to try and assassinate an ISIS leader, but the name of the ISIS figure in question is edited out of the video. After what appears to be a scripted warning to others \\"who want to come here and spy\\" to \\"repent to Allah now before it's too late,\\" the setting in the video changes to an outdoor location where the men are seen kneeling with their backs to a bearded militant whom CBS News could not identify and a boy, who appeared to be less than 15 years old. Both the adult jihadist and the boy appear to be of Asian descent. The man recites Quranic verse before saying: \\"Allah has gifted the Islamic State's security agency with the apprehension of these two spies.\\" He says the men are \\"now in the custody of the lion cubs of Khilafah,\\" before prompting the boy to go ahead with the apparent execution with a pat on the shoulder. The video, which is heavily edited and includes English subtitles throughout, then appears to show the boy shoot both men in the back of the head. No blood can be seen on the bodies in the final shots of the purported execution sequence, and the video then transitions to a clip from an older video, released in Nov. 2014, in which the same boy is seen expressing aspirations to one day become a \\"mujahid.\\" The older video shows the boy with other purported newcomers to ISIS territory, including many women and other children. The November video includes images from an ISIS religious school, where kids as young as six or seven are seen being groomed to become future militants for the group. CBS News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video released by ISIS, nor the identity of the men seen in it. CBS News was seeking comment from officials in Moscow. In the meantime, Russian news agency RIA Novosti said a representative of the FSB told them it \\"does not comment on the publication of the video executions allegedly of their agents by the members of the 'Islamic state.'\\" ISIS has executed scores of people in territory seized on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border, including American and European journalists and aid workers, rival militia members and soldiers from both nations' armies. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A video has been released by a group called Isis, and it shows a very sad and scary situation.

A: pick from the following. -theory; -hypothesis; -scientific controls; -scientific method; A:","completion":"The set of steps that help us answer questions in science can be described as the \\"scientific method.\\" The scientific method is a systematic and logical approach to problem-solving that involves observing, questioning, forming and testing hypotheses, and drawing conclusions based on empirical evidence. This method serves as the foundation of modern scientific inquiry and ensures that results are reliable, reproducible, and rigorously tested. Let's delve into the different components of the scientific method and understand how each step contributes to answering scientific questions. 1. Observation: The scientific process begins with careful observation. Researchers first notice a phenomenon or event and record these observations either quantitatively (with numbers) or qualitatively (in words). Observations can be made through direct experience, examination of data from previous studies, or review of pertinent literature. 2. Questioning: Based on the observations, scientists develop questions that seek to find explanations for the phenomenon or event. Questions should be specific, testable, and based on the available information. 3. Background research: To adequately address the question, researchers review existing literature, studies, and expert opinions to better understand the subject and refine their question or hypothesis. This research helps to ensure that their study is based on the latest knowledge and offers new insights into the problem. 4. Formulating hypotheses: A hypothesis serves as a tentative, testable explanation for the observed phenomenon. It is an educated guess, based on the available evidence and background research. A properly formulated hypothesis should be clear, concise, and falsifiable, meaning it must be possible to disprove it with empirical evidence. 5. Designing experiments: To test the hypothesis, researchers design experiments or studies that control for variables and manipulate conditions to observe the effects on the phenomenon. Careful experimental design is crucial to produce meaningful and interpretable results, accounting for potential confounding factors and sources of error. 6. Conducting experiments: Researchers carry out the experiments they have designed, carefully controlling empirical conditions and collecting data. This step involves repeating trials, ensuring adequate sample sizes, and using appropriate techniques to reduce the impact of bias or random error on results. 7. Analyzing data: Once the data is collected, researchers use statistical analysis to determine the significance of their findings and evaluate the support for their hypothesis. Depending on the nature of the data, various tests and methods can be employed to determine relationships, correlations, and causation between variables. 8. Drawing conclusions: After analyzing the data, scientists draw conclusions about whether the results support or refute the hypothesis. This step allows researchers to objectively evaluate their findings and determines if any adjustments or additional experiments are needed. 9. Communicating results: The final step of the scientific method involves sharing research findings with the scientific community. Researchers often publish their studies in peer-reviewed journals, ensuring that the study has been subjected to rigorous evaluation by other experts in the field. This process allows for further discussion, scrutiny, and improvement of the study and promotes the advancement of scientific knowledge. The scientific method thus provides researchers with a structured and thorough approach to answering questions, enhancing our understanding of the world and informing evidence-based decision-making. By following these steps, scientists can minimize sources of bias and error, ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of their results and fostering trust in the scientific process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometimes he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time.

These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\". - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river . - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence). - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra. Although recorded in 1942, the single would not be released until 1944 where it was Duke Ellington's last of four number one's on the Harlem Hit Parade. \\"Main Stem\\" also peaked at number twenty on the pop chart.

The primary issue raised is the change in legal advice provided by the Attorney General regarding the legality of the war. The opposition is demanding an explanation for the abrupt alteration in the official stance on the issue. The Attorney General initially claimed that the war in Iraq was in breach of international law. However, subsequent advice saw a sudden shift, deeming military action legal under specific circumstances. The opposition has expressed growing concerns over this change, arguing that it appears to have had a significant influence on the government's decision to participate in the controversial conflict. Seeking transparency and a detailed account of the events leading to the change in legal advice, the opposition is pushing for a public inquiry. This inquiry would delve into the factors that may have pressured the Attorney General to alter his initial view on the war's legality. The goal is to shed light on the reasons behind the change and ensure that the government did not act in self-interest or succumb to external pressure. Opposition leaders emphasize the importance of understanding the sequence of events and the context in which the change occurred. This information is vital for the public to have confidence in the government's ability to act within the bounds of international law and to uphold responsible decision-making. The British government has yet to provide an official response to these demands. However, the increasing pressure from the opposition and the public cannot be ignored. It is crucial that the government take swift action to address these concerns and reassure the people that its decisions are made in the best interests of the nation and with the utmost consideration for legality and ethics. In conclusion, the opposition's demand for an explanation regarding the change in the Attorney General's advice on the legality of the war in Iraq is a pressing issue. By addressing these concerns transparently and openly, the British government can maintain public trust and promote a culture of accountability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Two longtime GOP lawmakers announced their retirements Tuesday from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans electing to leave Capitol Hill under the Trump administration rather than face voters in next year's midterm elections. Twelve-term Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey declared in a statement that \\"our nation is now consumed by increasing political polarization\\" and \\"there is no longer middle ground.\\" The 71-year-old became the latest moderate Republican to leave Congress and open up a seat that will be ripe for Democrats to pick up as they fight to retake control of the House next year. Then, several hours later, seven-term Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, a conservative, announced that he too plans to retire rather than seek re-election to another term next year. Poe, 69, whose district covers parts of Houston and northern suburbs, said in a statement that \\"Thanks to the lord, I'm in good health, but it's time for the next step.\\" He added that he was looking forward to spending more time with his grandkids. Poe's district is solidly Republican and would be a struggle for Democrats to win. With the announcements from LoBiondo and Poe, the list of Republicans who've announced plans to retire rather than seek re-election is now near two dozen, compared to fewer than half-a-dozen Democrats. Although only a handful of the GOP seats opening up are highly competitive for the Democrats, the many retirements nonetheless are adding up to an increasingly rosy scenario for Democrats, who must pick up two dozen seats to win back the House. LoBiondo said the time is right for him to leave anyway because of term limits on his service on the Intelligence Committee and as chairman of the Transportation Committee's subcommittee on aviation. But he also delivered an indictment of the current political climate. \\"As some of my closest colleagues have also come to realize, those of us who came to Congress to change Washington for the better through good governance are now the outliers,\\" LoBiondo wrote. \\"In legislating, we previously fought against allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Today a vocal and obstinate minority within both parties has hijacked good legislation in pursuit of no legislation.\\" LoBiondo joins several other House GOP moderates, including Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who have decided not to seek re-election in next year's midterms. Also Tuesday, Arizona Republicans confirmed that another establishment-friendly House Republican, Rep. Martha McSally, plans to run for Senate for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. Taken together, the departures of GOP moderates could result in an even more polarized House than exists today. In years past large blocs of moderate Blue Dog Democrats and centrist Republicans could sway outcomes on legislation, but the ranks of the Blue Dogs have already been decimated while the GOP moderates are dwindling fast. ___ Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed. ||||| Sound smart: It's tempting to read too much into off-year elections. And, given both Virginia and New Jersey are states Hillary Clinton won, they by all measures should have gone to Democrats. But don't underestimate how much unity, momentum, money will now flow to Democrats — and how much finger-pointing and funk they avoided. For the first time since Election Night one year ago today, Democrats could smile. On a day that set the opening tone for the midterm elections of 2018, voters rejected President Trump, handed Democrats a big win in a swing state in a racially charged moment, and provided hope — however fleeting or fanciful — that they can win back power in Washington. In the Virginia governor's race, Democrat Ralph Northam beat Ed Gillespie by 9 points — a far bigger margin than either party had foreseen, and far wider than Hillary Clinton's win over Trump. Some empirical data behind the hope: The stunning margin was booked largely in Northern Virginia, in what MSNBC's Steve Kornacki called \\"the revenge of the suburbs\\" after a year of Trump. U.Va.'s Larry Sabato told me there's one explanation: \\"Donald Trump. He really is deeply unpopular in urban-suburban Virginia. Voter after voter wanted to send him a message, and said so. Of course, he won't listen, but the message was sent.\\" Gillespie lost women by 22 percentage points. He won men by 2 percentage points. Gillespie won whites by 15 percentage points, and still got crushed. Northam won by a 24 point margin among those who decided in last week. It looks like those racially tinged ads/moves backfired. And it wasn't just Northam: In what the Richmond Times-Dispatch called a \\"tsunami election,\\" Democrats erase a 32-seat GOP advantage in the House of Delegates, with recounts likely to determine control. Plus national history: \\"Virginia's most socially conservative state lawmaker was ousted from office ... by Danica Roem, a Democrat who will be one of the nation's first openly transgender elected officials and who embodies much of what Del. Robert G. Marshall fought against in Richmond.\\" (WashPost) A white mayor won by the largest margin in decades in predominantly black Detroit. The first African American Democratic woman was elected mayor of Charlotte. A Democrat will replace Chris Christie in New Jersey. A Democrat knocked off a GOP incumbent in New Hampshire's largest city to become Manchester's first female mayor. \\"Voters in Maine ... easily approved a referendum to expand Medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed the move — a key element of Obamacare.\\" (NPR) A big story that could get lost in the blizzard: Two more House Republicans — Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Rep. Ted Poe of Texas — announced their retirements, increasing chances Dems take the House a year from now. The takeaways: Top Republicans were stunned by the severity of the shellacking, and worry that it will endanger both tax reform and the House majority. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Two long-time Republicans, Frank LoBiondo and Ted Poe, have decided to retire from the House of Representatives, adding to the growing list of Republicans choosing to leave under President Trump's administration.

The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. and a hint : The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply.

Please answer this question : Which country experienced an increase in collection amounts?","completion":"Based on the Laffer curve theory and the information provided, Hinland is the country that likely experienced an increase in collection amounts. The Laffer curve demonstrates that there exists a critical tax rate, above which the labor supply decreases, causing government revenue to decline. When tax rates are above the critical point, a reduction in tax rates stimulates the labor supply, resulting in increased government revenue. In the given situation, Hinland reduced taxation, which according to the Laffer curve, would mean more money for government spending if the country's previous tax rate was above the critical point. Assuming this to be true, Hinland's decision to lower tax rates led to an increase in labor supply and, therefore, an increase in government revenue. On the other hand, Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate, which, according to the Laffer curve, would likely result in a decline in labor supply and a decrease in overall government revenue. Silvanian people faced a higher tax burden, which could have disincentivized work and led to lower collection amounts compared to Hinland.

Use the following highlights to write an article: 'Continual economic growth is not sustainable,' said Royal Society panel. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"The Illusion of Infinite Growth: Royal Society Panel Sounds the Alarm\\" Introduction: A recent discussion by a panel of experts at the Royal Society has sparked a crucial debate on the long-held belief in perpetual economic growth. The panel has argued that unbridled economic expansion is unsustainable in the long run, posing significant challenges to both our environment and social structures. Step 1: Presenting the Argument To delve deeper into this argument, it's imperative first to understand the underlying assumption that economies must continually grow in order to progress and prosper. This notion, deeply ingrained in the minds of policymakers and business leaders alike, has been the driving force behind the global push for wealth creation and development over the past few decades. Step 2: The Environmental Consequences However, the implications of this relentless growth are particularly worrisome when it comes to the environment. As countries race against each other to raise their GDP (Gross Domestic Product) figures, this often leads to the exploitation and depletion of natural resources. The panel at the Royal Society was categorical in its assertion that unchecked growth poses a significant threat to our planet's ecosystems – an issue that transcends national boundaries and has a direct impact on the well-being of current and future generations. Step 3: The Social Repercussions Beyond the environmental impact, the panel also highlighted the social implications of endless economic growth. Wealth inequality and the marginalization of vulnerable communities are two critical concerns arising from a system focused solely on expanding the economy. The relentless pursuit of growth may have led to advances in our living standards, but the cracks in our social fabric are starting to show. Step 4: Challenging the Status Quo Given these pressing issues, the panel's message is an urgent call to reevaluate our understanding of progress and prosperity. Challenging the status quo, the panel posits that it is high time to explore alternative models of economic development that prioritize sustainability, environmental preservation, and social equity, rather than simply increasing GDP figures. Step 5: Offering Potential Solutions As nations grapple with the prospect of redefining progress, they need to consider creative approaches to address the economic and environmental challenges at hand. This may entail reshaping economic policies and business practices to prioritize long-term benefits over short-term gains. Broadening the focus to include circular economies, renewable energy sources, and resource-efficient technologies could be vital steps in building a more sustainable future for all. Conclusion: The Royal Society panel's remarks on the unsustainability of continuous economic growth serve as a stark reminder that the race for wealth and development must be tempered with considerations for our planet's well-being and the global community. The time has come to confront the challenges head-on and embrace alternative models of development that focus on creating a socially and environmentally sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Labor said PM Tony Abbott's offer of a same-sex marriage plebiscite next year was nothing but a \\"delaying tactic\\". The attack comes as Mr Abbott faces criticism within his own ranks about how he has handled the issue. On Tuesday, he blocked a free vote for government MPs on any same-sex marriage bills but said the issue should be \\"put to the people\\" after the next election. Read more: 'Crocodile Dundee' MP leads Australia gay marriage push Labor leader Bill Shorten called on all Coalition MPs in favour of same-sex marriage to keep lobbying the prime minister. \\"The choice in this country is you either have Mr Abbott or you have marriage equality but you can't have both,\\" he told reporters on Wednesday. Mr Shorten has pledged to introduce same-sex marriage legislation within the first 100 days if Labor wins the next election, due in 2016. Mr Abbott, who personally opposes same-sex marriage, on Wednesday said under Liberal Party policy, any government frontbenchers who defied the agreed position to oppose gay marriage would be sacked. Backbench coalition MP Warren Entsch plans to introduce a cross-party bill next week to legalise same-sex marriage. Mr Entsch, who has campaigned publicly for marriage equality, told local media he believed some of his colleagues would cross the floor to vote in favour of his bill. \\"Absolutely I will be crossing the floor,\\" he said, \\"but even with some support I don't think the support is there to see it succeed\\". Analysis: Jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney The gay marriage issue in Australia is an interesting one, not least because Tony Abbott, and indeed politicians in general, are out of touch with public opinion. Polls show the majority of Australians support same-sex marriage. And that's why it's a potentially dangerous issue for Mr Abbott who admits to feeling \\"a bit threatened\\" by homosexuality - even though his own sister Christine is a lesbian. And it's not just the public Tony Abbott is out of sync with. Some MPs within his own Liberal Party are in favour of legalising gay marriage. So if the prime minister continues to deny his parliamentary colleagues a free conscience vote on the issue, he risks alienating some within his own party. Is Abbott being refreshingly honest or out of touch? Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who supports same-sex marriage and a free vote on it by government MPs, said the issue would distract from debate about the economy and jobs ahead of next year's election. \\"The attraction of a free vote would have been that the matter would have been settled one way or another in this parliament,\\" Mr Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday. He said Mr Abbott's offer to hold a plebiscite meant same-sex marriage was now \\"a live issue all the way up to the next election\\". Mr Abbott's sister Christine Forster, a Liberal local councillor in Sydney, agreed with this assessment. Ms Forster, who is a lesbian and has publically supported same-sex marriage, told the BBC that she found her brother's decision \\"personally very disappointing\\" and hoped that the party would review its position soon. But she added: \\"We both respect each other's views... and that reflects Australian society as a whole, there are a range of views on this issue.\\" The Labor Party has also faced internal debate about the matter. At a party conference in July, Mr Shorten convinced his colleagues not to adopt a binding vote on same-sex marriage. Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek had unsuccessfully lobbied her colleagues to amend the Labor platform so that MPs would be forced to vote in favour of same-sex marriage in parliament. Summary:","completion":"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has faced criticism within his own ranks about his handling of the same-sex marriage issue.

Asta implică garantarea unor drepturi și condiții de muncă echitabile pentru toți lucrătorii europeni și promovarea de politici care să vizeze reducerea inegalităților sociale și economice. Pe lângă politici sociale și economice solide, trebuie să se asigure accesul la o protecție socială adecvată pentru grupurile vulnerabile precum tinerii, vârstnicii și migranții. În concluzie, abordarea problemei ocupării forței de muncă la nivelul Uniunii Europene necesită o strategie coerentă și multidimensională. Prin unirea sub umbrela celor trei cuvinte-cheie - a reacționa, a evolua și a proteja - UE poate face pași importanți pentru a face față provocărilor viitoare în domeniul ocupării forței de muncă și pentru a construi o societate mai incluzivă și solidară pentru toți cetățenii săi."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: A TV journalist in China who was photographed for wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to shelter from the sun has been suspended from her job.","completion":"Title: TV Journalist in China Suspended Over Sunglasses and Umbrella Controversy Introduction In a recent turn of events, a television journalist from China has been suspended from her job after her photograph went viral on social media. The picture showed the journalist wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to shield herself from the sun's rays. This seemingly innocent act, however, sparked an unexpected controversy, leading to her suspension. In this article, we will explore the incident, the reasons behind her suspension, and public reactions. The Incident The Chinese television journalist in question works for a local Chinese news network. In the photograph, she can be seen wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella to protect herself from the sweltering sun while reporting outdoors. According to reports, the image was captured by a passerby and subsequently posted online, where it garnered significant attention and quickly went viral. Reasons for Suspension On one hand, one could argue that the journalist was simply following standard safety protocols while outdoors to protect herself from the harmful ultraviolet rays. Sunglasses and umbrellas or parasols have been used for centuries as a means of protection from the sun, and their use is especially prevalent in places with high temperatures and direct sunlight. On the other hand, some critics argue that her actions were unbefitting of a professional news reporter. They claim that her use of sunglasses and an umbrella while on duty might give people the impression that she is not serious about her job, or that it distracts viewers from her reporting. Furthermore, these critics believe that a journalist on air should abide by a certain level of professionalism and decorum in terms of appearance, which her actions seemingly jeopardized. It is important to note that the Chinese media industry adheres to strict regulations, and there have been previous instances where news anchors or reporters have been suspended or even fired for violating these guidelines. In this context, the journalist's employer may have wanted to avoid any potential backlash or controversy by taking measures against her behavior. Public Reaction The incident has drawn mixed reactions from the public. Many people on social media have come out in support of the suspended journalist, stating that her actions were not inappropriate or unprofessional. They argue that she was simply taking care of her health while working outdoors and claim that the suspension was unjust. Others, however, believe that the employer's decision was warranted. They argue that a professional journalist should maintain a certain level of appearance and that protecting oneself from the sun could have been achieved privately without having to appear on camera with sunglasses and an umbrella. These individuals assert that the journalist's behavior could potentially compromise the credibility of her reporting and the overall reputation of the news network. Conclusion In conclusion, the suspension of a Chinese television journalist for wearing sunglasses and holding an umbrella while reporting outdoors has sparked a significant debate on professionalism and expectations within the media industry. While some have criticized her actions, many others defend her right to protect her health and well-being in a public space. This incident raises crucial questions about the evolving roles and expectations of journalists in an increasingly public-facing profession."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, let's look at the numbers you have: 2266, 278, 2087, and 3991. 2. Now, you have to solve the equation: 2266 = 278*l + 2087 - 3991 3. To make things easier, let's solve the addition and subtraction parts first. So, you need to add 2087 and then subtract 3991: 2087 - 3991 = -1904 4. Now, substitute this value back into the equation: 2266 = 278*l - 1904 5. Next, we need to get the 'l' all by itself. So, let's add 1904 to both sides of the equation: 2266 + 1904 = 278*l 4170 = 278*l 6.

Movie plot title: Cleopatra Movie plot: Claudette Colbert in Cleopatra In 48 BC, Cleopatra vies with her brother Ptolemy for control of Egypt. Pothinos (Leonard Mudie) kidnaps her and Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges much to Pothinos' surprise- he tries to deny who she is. However Caesar sees through the deception and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of not only Egypt, but also India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses, but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius (Ian Maclaren), Casca (Edwin Maxwell), Brutus (Arthur Hohl) and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia, played by Gertrude Michael). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer (Harry Beresford) who warns him about the Ides of March, Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home. Bitter rivals Marc Antony and Octavian (Ian Keith) are named co-rulers of Rome.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions you have asked are not the same and pertain to different topics. I'll provide a detailed answer for each question separately. 1. Do professional poker players have day jobs? Professional poker players may or may not have day jobs, depending on their level of success, financial security, and personal preferences. For some poker players, the game itself is their primary source of income. These players invest a substantial amount of time and effort into honing their skills, analyzing opponents, and participating in high-stakes games and tournaments. They often find it challenging to maintain a day job alongside such commitments. However, many professional poker players do have day jobs, especially in the initial stages of their careers when they are still building their bankroll and gaining experience. These players typically have part-time or full-time jobs in various fields, which serve as a primary source of income and provide financial stability while they perfect their poker skills. Some players continue to work part-time even after achieving notable success in their poker careers, just to maintain steady income and a sense of balance in their lives. 2. How can you prepare for your first pap smear test? A Pap smear test, also known as a Pap test or cervical smear, is a routine medical examination that checks for any cellular changes in the cervix that could potentially indicate conditions such as cervical cancer. To prepare for your first Pap smear test, consider the following steps: a. Schedule your appointment: Schedule the test when you are not on your period. Ideally, it should be planned two weeks after the first day of your last menstrual cycle. Avoid scheduling during your period, as the presence of blood may interfere with the results. b. Avoid intercourse and vaginal products: For 24 to 48 hours before the test, abstain from sexual intercourse, using tampons, and applying vaginal creams or other products. These can affect the results of your test or cause discomfort during the examination. c. Prepare mentally: It is normal to feel nervous or anxious before your first Pap test. Research the procedure, understand its purpose, and be aware of what will happen during the examination. This can help you feel more comfortable and prepared. If you have concerns or questions, do not hesitate to discuss them with your healthcare provider. d. Dress comfortably: Wear comfortable, easy-to-remove clothing for the appointment. You will likely need to undress from the waist down for the examination, so wearing a skirt or dress might make the process easier for you. e. Arrive early: Give yourself ample time to fill out any necessary paperwork and discuss your medical history with the healthcare provider before the examination. This can help you feel more at ease and allow the appointment to run smoothly. f. Relax during the appointment: While the Pap smear test may feel slightly uncomfortable, it is generally not painful. Relax and take deep breaths during the examination, which typically lasts only a few minutes. Be sure to let the healthcare provider know if you experience any severe discomfort or pain. The two questions you have asked cover distinct topics: professional poker and medical examinations.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). Question: \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\" Answer: \\"Ruler and subject\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct, but it is incomplete. Confucius emphasized several hierarchical and dictatorial relationships, including ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, and the individual and the state. Confucius believed that if these relationships were not properly maintained and respected, it would result in negative consequences for individuals, families, and entire nations.

It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School.

Background: John Kenneth Galbraith (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. Context: In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%. Question: What was the high point of his career? Answer:","completion":"The high point of John Kenneth Galbraith's career was likely his tenure as the United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963 during President John F. Kennedy's administration. During this time, Galbraith not only became a close confidant of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and advised the Indian government on economic matters, but he also established a strong rapport with President Kennedy, allowing him to bypass the State Department and communicate directly with the president. His influence and connections during this period, as well as his role in helping set up one of the first computer science departments in India, showcase the peak of his career as a public intellectual and influential economist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Add 2 quarts (1.89 liters) of marble dust to the bucket and stir with a mixing rod or a wooden stick. You can get a wooden stick free at any paint store. Step 5: With the lime putty already in the bucket, adding the marble dust will create the main base for Venetian plaster. It is crucial to integrate these two ingredients properly to achieve the desired consistency and texture. Step 6: Use a mixing rod or a wooden stick to mix the lime putty and marble dust thoroughly. Ensuring there are no lumps or dry patches will result in a smoother and more uniform final product. Step 7: Once the lime putty and marble dust have been combined effectively, continue to mix vigorously until the mixture reaches a smooth, creamy consistency. Step 8: Optional, but advisable, is to add a tinted colorant to the plaster mixture according to your design preference. Gradually add the colorant while stirring continuously until you reach the desired color. Step 9: Apply the Venetian plaster to the desired surface using a steel trowel or spatula. Spread it evenly and thinly over the area, applying multiple layers if required. Make sure each layer dries completely before applying the next. This will give the plaster depth and texture, which is characteristic of Venetian plaster. Step 10: Once the final layer of plaster has dried, use a clean, slightly damp trowel to burnish the surface. This will remove any remaining imperfections and give the wall a glossy finish. The Venetian plaster is now complete."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A small bronze sculpture that was dismissed as a 'humble' paperweight for decades has been confirmed as an £80,000 Barbara Hepworth. The 1965 work, called Oval Form, sat on the headteacher's desk at St Ives School for years and was originally used as a house prize when students performed well. But was revealed as 'probably the most expensive paperweight in the world' by stunned experts on BBC's Antiques Roadshow on Sunday. The £80,000 sculpture Oval Form, pictured, was originally used as a prize for academic achievement before it became one of the world's most expensive paperweights. David Harris, St Ives School head, said the paperweight would not leave the school in Cornwall, despite its value. He said: 'It's sitting on my desk so it's probably the most expensive paperweight in the world. Dame Barbara Hepworth, pictured, was a governor at St Ives School in Cornwall and gave the sculpture as a gift. She died in 1975. 'We have links to the art scene because we live and work in St Ives so we knew it was valuable but we'd not had it valued. We didn't know it was that valuable. 'Not that it is of any consequence because it's the school's and it will remain the school's. It's a fabulous piece of work and it's something which we do treasure.' Mr Harris said Oval Form was given to the school by the artist - who used to be a governor there - many years ago as a gift. It was used as a prize for the house that achieved the most academic merits each term. St Ives School librarian Jan Wardman took the 'paperweight' to show experts on the popular BBC show in Falmouth and beamed as she was told the news. Visibly excited Rupert Maas, an expert in ceramics and glass, told the show: 'It's by Barbara Hepworth. 'This is English Modernism, you know, you cannot confuse it with anything else. 'It is very tactile and made of bronze. It's worth £60,000 to £80,000. And it's a very important thing. It's a seriously exciting find. 'There's a lovely sense to it and turning it around is quite fun because it looks completely different from all angles. 'It's easy to forget that here in Cornwall we're actually at the cutting edge of Modernism really. Barbara Hepworth was really at the forefront of British Modernism.' Tourists flock to St Ives to see Barbara Hepworth's large bronze Modernist sculptures in the Hepworth Memorial Garden. Another sculpture sits outside the. Guildhall, home to St Ives Town Council but this smaller example of her. work is not widely known. TV antiques expert Rupert Maas, pictured, described the piece as a 'seriously exciting find' and said it was worth up to £80,000. The staggering valuation of the bronze was a surprise to the school, who expected it to be worth considerably less. Mr Harris added: 'It's not something we let out of our sight now. 'The guy on Antiques Roadshow said it will be in the upper reaches because it's such a beautiful domestic piece. 'For them it was a significant find. It did look lovely on the television with the light catching it. It is beautiful and a very tactile piece.'

Summarize this article: Last October seven island sites were granted dark sky status by an international body which recognises the best locations around the world. The government now wants to build on that number with a view to attracting astronomers from all over the planet. The Milky Way must be clearly visible to qualify as a dark sky site. The chairman of the Isle of Man Astronomical Society, Howard Parkin said: \\"Sites must be clear of light pollution, provide good sightlines of the sky and have good public access.\\". \\"All sites must have the approval of the relevant landowner,\\" he added. Mr Parkin is working with the government on the plan and believes the island could have dozens of suitable locations. The island's seven sites mean it already has the largest concentration of dark sky sites in Britain. The areas already recognised by the Dark Sky Association include Smeale Nature Reserve, Niarbyl and The Sound. Other areas that have been awarded the status are Port Soderick Brooghs, Axnfell Plantation Fort Island and Sulby Reservoir Car Park. The classification is given to promote astronomy and energy efficiency. A tourism spokesman said the development of specialist niche markets to attract high-spending visitors is a cornerstone of their current strategy. According to government figures visitor spending increased by more than 5% in 2012 to Â£103m, with spending by leisure visitors up by 14% to Â£47.7m. Mr Parkin added: \\"The beauty of the island is that it has very little light pollution. There are no motorways or large built up areas, so as a consequence you only have to drive a little way to find a dark sky site and enjoy the splendour of the night sky. \\"We are the only place which has seven locations in one area. The Isles Scilly have got five nominated sites but we already have seven approved and to be quite honest we could have 27. We have some of the clearest skies in Europe.\\" For the project to go ahead at least 15 more sites will need to obtain the status from the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh. People have until 31 July to submit their suggestions. Summary:","completion":"In October last year, seven island sites in the Isle of Man were granted dark sky status by an international body that recognizes the best stargazing locations around the world. The Isle of Man government now aims to increase the number of dark sky sites to attract astronomers globally.

The island already has the largest concentration of dark sky sites in Britain and could potentially have dozens of suitable locations. The Dark Sky Association has recognized areas such as Smeale Nature Reserve, Niarbyl, and The Sound. The classification promotes astronomy and energy efficiency, aligning with the government's strategy to develop specialist niche markets and attract high-spending visitors. The Isle of Man experiences little light pollution and has some of the clearest skies in Europe, making it an ideal location for stargazing.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries. Experts estimate that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health. On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health. Although many companies, especially large foreign-invested and State-owned ones, have done well in protecting workers\` health, many employees are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support. At least 90 per cent of Chinese companies are small or medium-sized organizations. Many of these companies, especially private ones based in towns and villages, do not want to spend their...

The 19-metre (62.3ft) wave happened between Iceland and the United Kingdom, off the Outer Hebrides. It was created in the aftermath of a very strong cold front with 43.8 knot (50.4mph) winds on 4 February 2013. The WMO, which released the data, said the previous record was 18.275 metres (59.96ft) in December 2007. That wave was also in the North Atlantic. It is not the biggest-ever recorded wave, however. In 2002 a ship spotted a 29-metre (95 ft) North Atlantic wave. In 2014, the M4 Donegal buoy recorded a 23.4 metre wave, but the WMO said the new record was based on \\"significant wave height\\" which required certain measuring methods and observing periods. The buoy is part of the UK Met Office's network of Marine Automatic Weather Stations. Known as K5, it sits in the North Atlantic off the Western Isles The buoys complement ship-based measurements and satellite observations, which monitor the oceans and forecast meteorological hazards on the high seas. Giant waves can be created in the north Atlantic, which stretches from the Grand Banks plateau off the coast of Canada to the area south of Iceland and west of the UK. In winter, wind circulation and pressure systems cause extratropical storms, sometimes known as bombs, the WMO said. The height of a wave is measured from the crest of one to the trough of the next.","completion":"A 19-metre wave recorded off the Outer Hebrides in 2013 has been confirmed as the largest ever measured in the North Atlantic, breaking the previous record of 18.275 metres set in 2007."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The victim was part of a group of hunters, who shot the bear with a bow and arrow and thereafter, waited four hours to track it down, to prevent the bear's meat from spoiling in the evening heat. Upon finding the bear lying injured, it incredibly charged onto the man, clawing and biting him brutally. In the ensuing attack, the man managed to fatally stab the bear around 20 times, eventually leading to the bear's death. The repercussions of the attack were significant, as the anonymous man endued severe injuries, including two broken arms and wounds on his face, jaw, stomach, and legs. The quick response of Craig Lindstrom, a fellow hunter and trained Chicago city firefighter saved the man's life. Lindstrom led his friend half a mile out of the woods and contacted the Pine County Sheriff's Office.

Start by making a basic “hmmm” noise in your throat in your lower range as you exhale a breath. Repeat this five to 10 times, then repeat the same sound with your mouth open for five to 10 breaths. With your mouth open, you should make an “ahhhh” noise. Humming is a great way to warm up and relax the muscles of your throat, face, neck, and shoulders, and it can also help you control your breathing. Once your voice is warmed up with basic humming, begin to warm up for pitch changes by humming do-re-mi up the scale and then back down. Start at the lower end of your pitch range, and when you complete one sweep up and down the scale, go to a higher key and repeat. Repeat this for four or five ascending keys, then work your way back down those same keys. Lip trills, also called lip buzzing or bubbling, are an exercise that vibrates and warms up your lips as well as your voice. To create the lip trill, you close your lips loosely, pout them slightly, and blow air through them (think of making the sound of a motor or raspberry). Do this for two exhales, then start slowly shaking your head from side to side as you do three or four more lip trills. Repeat the lip trilling and head shaking, and as you do this make a “b” sound with your mouth as you do vocal sweeps starting with a high note and going low, and then coming back up. Make an “ng” sound in your nose as though you were just saying the final part of the word “sung.” Continue to make this noise as you do three to five pitch sweeps. Every time you go back up and down again, push your voice into a slightly higher and lower pitch range. This exercise helps you warm up the voice gradually, prevents over-exertion of the voice, and helps singers transition between their head and chest voices, which refers to the different places air resonates in the body when creating different sounds and pitches. Tongue twisters are great for articulation practice, and if you say them in different pitches and at different volumes, they can be a great way to warm up before singing.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. and the situation: Tony and Greg are brothers. They are currently in the kitchen eating a snack together. Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away. Answer the following question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Tony will experience more tooth decay compared to Greg. There are several factors contributing to this conclusion. Firstly, Tony is consuming a snack consisting of candy, which is typically high in sugar content. The bacteria in the mouth feed on these sugars and produce lactic acid as a waste product. This lactic acid can dissolve tooth enamel, eventually leading to cavities and tooth decay. In contrast, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which is a much healthier snack option in terms of dental health. Celery is not only low in sugar but also can help clean teeth due to its fibrous texture. The act of chewing celery stimulates saliva production, which helps to neutralize acids in the mouth and wash away food particles stuck between teeth. This makes it less likely that Greg will develop tooth decay, at least in comparison to Tony. As for the milk products in the living room, it's worth noting that the lactic acid produced in fermentation contributes to the thickening of the milk, as mentioned in the background information. However, even if Greg consumes the thickened milk, it may not necessarily increase his risk of tooth decay significantly, especially when compared to Tony's candy consumption. Milk contains calcium, which is beneficial for teeth and can help to neutralize some of the acids in the mouth. So, while the thickened milk might not be as fresh, it should not significantly impact Greg's dental health. In conclusion, Tony is more likely to experience tooth decay due to his consumption of high-sugar candy, which promotes lactic acid production and tooth enamel erosion. On the other hand, Greg's choice of a healthier snack, celery, and the possibility of consuming milk products should not contribute as significantly to tooth decay. Therefore, Tony will likely experience more tooth decay than Greg."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Who kills the apprentice of the aged knight?

Co-chair of the Bronx DSA and editor at The Nation, Annie Shields, wrote that the group paid for Yiannopoulos’ beer “so he could go asap” before singing Solidarity Forever after he left. On his Facebook page, Yiannopoulos wrote that he was “blocked” from his table and “it was about to escalate into something ugly.” He said in the post that it “rattled me a little bit (just slightly!)” and added that the “staff were really understanding and cool about it.” Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now “But jeez.

The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process is the transportation of air to the lungs. This occurs through the act of inhaling or breathing in. When we breathe in, air enters the nostrils or mouth and travels down the pharynx, through the larynx, and into the trachea. The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a tube that connects the upper respiratory system to the lower respiratory system. The trachea then branches into two bronchi, each leading to one of the lungs. Within the lungs, the bronchi continue to branch into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. As the bronchioles extend deeper into the lung tissue, they eventually terminate at the alveoli, which are the smallest air sacs in the lungs. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the air we breathe and our bloodstream, with oxygen being taken in and carbon dioxide being expelled. The journey of air to the lungs begins with our diaphragm, which is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward, increasing the volume of the chest cavity. This action creates a vacuum, lowering the pressure inside the chest cavity relative to the outside air pressure. Air then rushes in through the mouth and nostrils, down the respiratory tract, and into the lungs to equalize the pressure. As we inhale and transport air to the lungs, we are setting the stage for the series of events that ultimately lead to the delivery of oxygen to our body's tissues. With each breath, the lungs work in concert with the cardiovascular system to ensure that oxygen is supplied to our vital organs, muscles, and cells, while carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is removed and expelled from our body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: We've used the wind as an energy source for a long time. The Babylonians and Chinese were using wind power to pump water for irrigating crops 4,000 years ago, and sailing boats were around long before that. Wind power was used in the Middle Ages, in Europe, to grind corn, which is where the term \\"windmill\\" comes from. We can use the energy in the wind by building a tall tower, with a large propeller on the top. The wind blows the propellor round, which turns a generator to produce electricity. We tend to build many of these towers together, to make a \\"wind farm\\" and produce more electricity. The more towers, the more wind, and the larger the propellors, the more electricity we can make. It's only worth building wind farms in places that have strong, steady winds, although boats and caravans increasingly have small wind generators to help keep their batteries charged. The best places for wind farms are in coastal areas, at the tops of rounded hills, open plains and gaps in mountains - places where the wind is strong and reliable. Some are offshore. To be worthwhile, you need an average wind speed of around 25 km/h. Most wind farms in the UK are in Cornwall or Wales. Isolated places such as farms may have their own wind generators. In California, several \\"wind farms\\" supply electricity to homes around Los Angeles. The propellors are large, to obtain energy from the largest possible volume of air. The blades can be angled to cope with varying wind speeds. Some designs use vertical turbines , which don't need to be turned to face the wind. The towers are tall, to get the propellors as high as possible, up to where the wind is stronger. This means that the land beneath can still be used for farming. Question: What can be a suitable title for the passage? Options: A: Where to build a wind farm. B: ABC of the using of wind energy. C: How to make best use of wind. D: Wind energy is the best energy.
