Given the question: This article: In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was persuaded to be a British delegate to a conference in Buenos Aires?, what is it ?

Sir William Walton was a renowned British composer, and it was Leslie Boosey who persuaded him to attend the conference on copyright in Buenos Aires in 1948. This was an effort to help Walton cope with his grief following the death of Alice Wimborne, his close friend and patron. While in Buenos Aires, Walton met Susana Gil Passo, who would later become his wife.

Trivia question: Plié is a movement that comes from what form of dance? And the answer is?","completion":"The term \\"plié\\" is rooted in ballet, a formalized form of dance with its origin in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th and 16th centuries. Ballet spread from Italy to France with the help of Catherine de' Medici, where it was developed further under her aristocratic influence. An elaborate dance training regimen and vocabulary were established as it steadily became entrenched in French culture. Later, in the 17th century, it was codified by Louis XIV’s establishment of the Académie Royale de Musique et de Danse. \\"Plié\\" is a French term that translates to \\"folded\\" or \\"bent\\". This specific movement is one of the principal and beginning exercises in a dance class and serves as a vital basic step in ballet. Implemented throughout various steps and motions in a dance sequence, pliés are intended to promote fluidity of movement, muscular warmth, and the instigation of grace and harmony to choreography. Completing a plié entails bending the knees while maintaining a straight back. Dancers can either perform a small bend, known as a demi-plié, or a full bend, aptly called a grand plié. Depending on their stance, which can be first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position, the dancer's feet will react differently to the motion. In ballet, the plié movement is not just an exercise; it is also integrated into jumps, turns, and other dance elements to increase flexibility and strength, promote proper alignment and technique, as well as to cushion the landings of jumps and provide impulse for various maneuvers. The study and performance of ballet have significantly influenced several other styles of dance and led to the set of dancing principles now employed in other dance genres. Therefore, the plié, a fundamental movement in ballet, is now incorporated not only in ballet itself but also in modern dance, jazz, and other forms of dance as an essential component of their repertoire as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio. After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning. It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserves and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016. The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama. While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941. In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc. While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight. Due to fears that German U-Boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah. Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers.

United States dollar The dollar was first based on the value and look of the Spanish dollar, used widely in Spanish America from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The first dollar coins issued by the United States Mint (founded 1792) were similar in size and composition to the Spanish dollar, minted in Mexico and Peru. The Spanish, U.S. silver dollars, and later, Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States, and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the Coinage Act of 1857.

Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than Rachel, because Options: [I] Natalie did not have an adventurous spirit.. [II] Rachel did not have an adventurous spirit..","completion":"Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than Rachel, because of the differences in their personalities regarding adventure. Considering the given options, we can analyze their inclination towards exploring new places. Option I states that Natalie did not have an adventurous spirit. If this is true, then it is less likely that she would be interested in traveling to foreign countries. This option contradicts the initial premise that Natalie is more likely to travel than Rachel. Option II states that Rachel did not have an adventurous spirit. In this case, it can be inferred that Rachel's lack of interest in new experiences and taking risks would make her less inclined to travel to unfamiliar places. On the other hand, this would imply that Natalie, who hasn't been mentioned to have any issues with adventure, would be more open to visiting foreign countries. Therefore, based on the available options, Rachel's lack of adventurous spirit (Option II) is the most viable reason why Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than her. Natalie, being more open to new experiences and challenges, would feel more drawn to explore different cultures, meet new people, and immerse herself in unknown environments, while Rachel would prefer sticking to familiar territories and avoiding the uncertainties that come with traveling abroad."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Lygia A:","completion":"Title: The Unlikely Love of Marcus and Lygia Plot: The story is set in ancient Rome during Emperor Nero's reign. Marcus Vinicius, a young and ambitious Roman centurion, has returned from a successful military campaign and is full of pride and glory. He is a loyal soldier, but he lacks faith and compassion, indulging in a life of excess, materialism, and hedonism. One day, wandering through the city, Marcus stumbles upon a secretive gathering of Christians. Although initially wary of Christians as they are considered enemies of Rome, he finds himself drawn to a beautiful and mysterious young woman named Lygia. She is gentle, wise, and committed to her Christian faith, which Marcus finds both intriguing and baffling. Despite their different backgrounds and opposing philosophies, Marcus and Lygia grow closer. Marcus struggles with his feelings for Lygia and his duty to Rome, and also confronts doubts about his own identity and values. He begins to question the way of life he has been taught to embrace and starts attending secret Christian meetings where he learns valuable lessons of love, sacrifice, and brotherhood. Meanwhile, Emperor Nero's paranoia grows. He orders a crackdown on Christians, falsely accusing them of causing the Great Fire of Rome. Lygia and her community narrowly evade capture but find themselves increasingly hunted by Roman soldiers. Torn between loyalty to Rome and his newfound faith, Marcus finally decides that he must defend Lygia and her Christian community, ultimately turning his back on Emperor Nero. He hatches a daring plan to help them escape from the clutches of the ever-encroaching Roman army; however, their journey leads them to the underground catacombs beneath the city, where they must navigate a labyrinth of darkness while being pursued by relentless soldiers. In a final confrontation, Marcus comes face-to-face with his former comrades and, driven by his love for Lygia and his newfound purpose, fights to protect the Christian community. As a result, he sacrifices his career, reputation, and place in society for the greater good. Escaping the catacombs and finding refuge, Marcus and Lygia profess their love and commitment to each other, as well as their faith in God. The film ends with a sense of hope and redemption as the Christian community begins to rebuild in the face of adversity. Throughout the story, the unlikely love between Marcus and Lygia serves as a symbol of unity crossing boundaries, healing past wounds, and embracing a more compassionate and spiritual way of life. It's a powerful testament to the transformative power of love and faith, rising triumphant amidst the chaos and persecution of ancient Rome."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices.

The 53-year-old's publicist thanked \\"those who, rightly, have chosen to celebrate his life and legacy.\\" Michael secretly paid £15,000 for a stranger's IVF treatment, former Deal or No Deal producer Richard Osman revealed. Osman, who now co-presents Pointless, tweeted: \\"A woman on 'Deal Or No Deal' told us she needed £15k for IVF treatment. \\"George Michael secretly phoned the next day and gave her the £15k.\\" There was \\"no more fitting tribute than the many, many kind words that have been said\\", Michael's publicist said. Other stories of the star's benevolence, including a £50,000 Sport Relief donation, have emerged on social media. In a string of tweets celebrating the singer's music and humour, comedian and author David Walliams said the star had supported his 2006 cross-Channel swim to the tune of £50,000. The woman who received IVF treatment was later named as Lynette Gillard, 38, from Bolton, whose partner Steve Davies had appeared on Deal or No Deal in 2008. She told the Telegraph: \\"For many years I wondered who would have been so generous and now I know. What more can I say other than 'Thank you George'.\\" At the time, Mr Davies had told the Manchester Evening News: \\"Thank you is not enough. It restores your faith in humankind. \\"All the bad news you read about and then something like this happens.\\" Michael's donations ranged in scope from major charities and appeals to individual acts of kindness. The proceeds from sales of Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me, his 1991 live duet with Sir Elton John, were donated to HIV and children's charities, including the Terence Higgins Trust. It tweeted: \\"Thank you to George Michael for all he did for the LGBT community and to educate about HIV.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What company prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York? from the following article ? With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects. He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse.

Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Snapchat agrees to settle FTC charges that it deceived users Messaging app Snapchat promised users that the photos and videos they send disappear forever seconds after they're opened. But security and privacy advocates have repeatedly reported that that's not always true. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission announced that the smartphone app maker has agreed to settle charges alleging that the company had deceived consumers with assurances about the \\"disappearing nature\\" of messages sent through the service and other data collection and security practices. The FTC complaint laid out several ways that photo \\"snaps\\" sent through the application could be saved without the users' knowledge. For example, some third-party apps could be used to capture messages sent through the service, the FTC said, and video messages remained accessible to recipients who connected their smartphone to a computer. The FTC also alleged that the app collected data from users without their consent or knowledge -- including geolocation information from those using the Android version of the app and contacts from the address books of those using the Apple iOS version. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Snapchat failed to properly secure it's \\"Find Friends\\" feature -- resulting in the widely reported security breach that allowed attackers to compile a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers. Snapchat later released an update that fixed the issue and let users to opt out of the feature. Under the terms of its settlement, Snapchat will not be fined. But the app maker will be prohibited from misrepresenting the privacy, security or confidentiality of user data within the app and be required to implement a comprehensive privacy program to be monitored by an independent party over the next 20 years. If Snapchat violates the settlement in the future, it could face financial penalties. Although the consent decree did not require Snapchat to admit fault, the app maker acknowledged in a statement to The Washington Post that it had made mistakes. \\"While we were focused on building, some things didn’t get the attention they could have,\\" Snapchat said in the statement, noting that it should have been \\"more precise\\" in how it communicated with users. But the company also insisted that it had resolved many of the issues in the complaint before the settlement was announced and that it is \\"devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate.\\" A recent update to Snapchat added new capabilities, including text messaging and video conferencing. The text messaging feature will allow recipients to save exchanges without notifying the sender -- a significant departure from the supposedly disappearing picture messages that drove the app's initial growth. Update: Julia Horwitz, Consumer Protection Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center which originally complained to the FTC about Snapchat, told the Post it was happy with the resolution. \\"We're extremely pleased that the FTC is taking its data privacy protection seriously and is recognizing behaviors by companies like Snapchat that breach promises to consumers,\\" she said. \\"This was a real success.\\" \\"But this consent order's true effectiveness depends upon the agency's consistent enforcement over the next 20 years,\\" she cautioned. Summary:","completion":"Snapchat agreed to settle charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding allegations that the company deceived consumers with assurances about the \\"disappearing nature\\" of messages sent through the service and other data collection and security practices.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

Article: For many of us, cartoon strips are simply one of our pastimes. The popular Japanese manga provides us with an escape from reality into a world of fantasy, adventure and romance.With much less text and pictures running for pages, it fits perfectly into today's fast, throwing away city lifestyle. But Tsai Chih-chung,a famous Taiwanese illustrator , doesn't agree.He believes cartoons can be a bridge connecting traditional Chinese culture and wisdom with the modern world in a much wittier and more acceptable way. He has interpreted Lao Zi, Confucius, Mencius,Zhuang Zi and Sun Zi and made their works accessible to a global audience. He has also produced two books about Zen , introducing oriental philosophy. His cartoons are humorous yet full of wisdom and are admired as an easy way to learn Chinese classics. After avoiding the public for ten years, Tsai made a comeback in late April with seven new works. But does his age, 61, work as a gap between him and his young readers? Tsai doesn't think so. The topics he has covered range from philosophy in a time of individuality to the learning and memorizing techniques used at school. \\"Every child is a genius and has the potential beyond his own imagination, \\" he said. If popular Japanese manga is purely for entertainment, Tsai's work, to a large extent, is to light the power of thinking in a light-hearted way. Tsai uses differenr forms of water to refer to people. In his eyes some people are like an ocean, some are like vapor, while others may be ice or rain. But in essence they share a similarity-human being's forever chasing for the true and the good. \\"The person who thinks over life issues is not necessarily a scholar or a philosopher,\\" he said. \\"I've dedicated my whole life to thinking and individual freedom, not making a living.\\" Question: According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE about Tsai Chih-chung? - He values more thinking and personal freedom than making a living. - He says that one who thinks over life is either a scholar or a philosopher. - He thinks some people are like ocean, some like vapor, while others like ice cream. - Tsai devoted his life to creating cartoons in order to make money.

She ran to the security booth and gave them the 20. After a week, nobody had claimed the money. Now do a next sentence writing task.","completion":"After a long and exciting summer of working at Cedar Point, Kelly's memorable experience of finding that 20 bill lingered in her mind. She often wondered what could have happened to the person who had lost it as she immediately reported it to the security booth, still feeling the fluttering excitement that came with such a discovery. However, the week went by incredibly quickly, with the hustle and bustle of her job in the amusement park keeping her fairly occupied, and her regular interactions with enthusiastic visitors allowed for very little time to think. Despite this, she couldn't shake the curiosity that loomed over the unclaimed cash. A week had passed since that fateful day, with the memory of the money she had found still etched in her mind. Kelly's brief breaks in between shifts were mostly spent pondering about the owner of the 20 bill. The more she thought about it, the more she realized it could have belonged to anyone – a thrill-seeking teenager enjoying the roller coasters, a patient parent waiting in line for their child's favorite ride, or even a zealous employee grabbing a snack between shifts. As the end of her summer job approached, Kelly made sure to casually inquire the security guards about the still unclaimed 20. The guards, being diligent in performing their duties, admitted that they had no luck in finding the owner, and it seemed somewhat bleak that it would ever be found. After discussing the situation with her supervisor, she was advised that the money could be returned to her, as the standard lost-and-found waiting period had expired, and no rightful owner had come forth to claim it despite their best efforts. With the extra 20 in her possession, Kelly now had an unexpected decision to make – how to spend her newly acquired money. She weighed her options carefully, considering not only her own desires and preferences but also the potential good deeds she could accomplish with the modest sum. Ultimately, Kelly decided that the mystery surrounding the 20 bill could be channeled into something positive, and she would use the money to celebrate her growing bond with her new work friends and the unforgettable memories that had been created over the summer. In an act of kindness and camaraderie, she pooled her newfound cash with some of her own savings and organized a small farewell celebration for her fellow employees at Cedar Point. It was a jovial and bittersweet event, filled with laughter, heartfelt farewells, and of course, delicious treats. At the end of the evening, Kelly handed out small souvenirs and token bags of candies for everyone in attendance, mentioning the story of the 20 bill as a reminder of the incredible and unpredictable adventures they had shared together at the amusement park. Though the money she found eventually was returned to her, the real treasure that Kelly took away from Cedar Point that summer was the cherished friendships and countless memories that were etched in her heart. Together with her new friends, they reminisced about their Cedar Point adventure, and the lost 20 bill ceased to be an enigma, but rather a symbol of fortuitous circumstances and the generosity that we all hold within ourselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.

Two of the leading advocates for peace in the global arena, Italy and Britain, have stepped forward to demonstrate their commitment to resolving the Kosovo crisis peacefully. The history of the Kosovo conflict, filled with ethnic tensions and political strife, has impacted Europe as a whole, uniting nations in their common desire for peace and stability in the region. Both Italy and Britain have firsthand experience of war and are aware of the disastrous consequences that a military conflict can culminate in. Drawing from their historical experiences and their commitments to international peace and security, they are favoring and endorsing efforts to identify diplomatic and peaceful solutions to the crisis. The offices of both the Italian and British prime ministers have issued clear declarations stating their commitment to a peaceful resolution in Kosovo. They have emphasized the critical role of negotiation and dialogue in addressing the tensions in the region, rather than resorting to further violence or military intervention. Both nations also see the United Nations as a crucial player in the peace process. Given its global perspective and commitment to international security, the UN has the potential to mediate negotiations and facilitate conversations between parties in conflict. Italy and Britain, as long-term members of the UN, have expressed their support for such a role and are willing to contribute any necessary resources to assist in these efforts. The British and Italian governments are putting forward comprehensive proposals that encourage all parties involved in the Kosovo conflict to engage in peaceful negotiations. Their strategies involve creating avenues for open dialogue, removing barriers to communication, and prioritizing the resolution of disputes through reconciliation and understanding, not further violence. Moreover, both Italy and Britain propose to involve other European powers, such as Germany and France, in their peace efforts. The combined effort and unison of all these powerful nations can apply significant diplomatic pressure to ensure swift resolution to the crisis. Both countries also understand the importance of addressing unresolved grievances and histories of conflict that have fueled the crisis in Kosovo. Thus, they are advocating not only for an end to current hostilities, but also for a comprehensive, long-term plan that will prevent future outbreaks of violence. Italy and Britain's favoring of peace efforts in the Kosovo crisis embodies the commitment to peace, diplomacy, and thoughtful action held by these nations. They support the idea that every potential opportunity for dialogue and negotiation should be explored fully before considering further escalation. In conclusion, Italy and Britain, along with other international allies, are taking tangible steps to mitigate the crisis in Kosovo. Their combined efforts stand as a testament to the power of diplomacy and peaceful negotiation in the face of conflict. While the road to peace in Kosovo is undoubtedly fraught with challenges, the commitment shown by Italy and Britain offers a shining beacon of hope for a peaceful resolution and a stable future for the region."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write a summary based on this article: A missing Los Angeles teenager was sexually assaulted, kept in a metal box and forced to process marijuana for her two captors, according to a federal criminal complaint filed this week. Prosecutors said the girl was held by Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 24, who are charged with conspiracy to distribute marijuana, using a minor in a drug operation and possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking. According to prosecutors, the case was blown open when a Los Angeles police detective called Lake County sheriff’s officials asking about a connection between Balletto and the girl. UPDATES: Pot farm raid reveals horrifying tale of teen's captivity An initial visit to the Balletto’s 680-acre property in Lake County by deputies on April 29 turned up nothing. But the next day, the girl called sheriff’s deputies back on a cellphone, court documents show. The girl told authorities she was doing “OK” and was with Balletto in Sacramento. Authorities traced the cellphone to West Sacramento, where police found the girl in a hotel with Pearmain. Police arrested the two. Police also allegedly found a bag full of marijuana, prescription drugs, condoms and a pregnancy test. Pearmain also had a notebook on him that had an apparent script for the girl to read to police over the phone, authorities claim. Sketches of a marijuana greenhouse and a list of supplies were also found. DOCUMENT: Read the criminal complaint The girl told authorities she was having consensual sex with both men, which officials noted is not legally possible given her age. She said the men told her they were on a “mission” with the marijuana and that they were holding her because she was so good at “trimming” or processing it for drying. On May 1, authorities raided Balletto’s rural home and his second home in Lakeport. On the rural property, which the girl knew as “the farm,” investigators found a metal box with holes in it. Spray painted on the outside was the first initial of the teenage girl’s name and inside was a decal that “depicted an animal skull surrounding the shadow image of a human skull with the logo ‘Bone Collector,’” according to the court documents. Human hair was found inside, prosecutors said. The girl said she was kept in the box for a total of three days and was given water through a hose. The box was hoisted into the air and tilted at an angle so when water was poured inside it would wash the girl and clean human waste out of the box, court documents say. Authorities said they also found a poem signed by the girl inside describing life in the box. Elsewhere on the property, investigators found sex toys and a wooden-framed “rack” to hoist and immobilize people. It was used for sexual bondage and sadomasochism, authorities said. A white towel below the rack had blood on it, according to prosecutors. Outside of Pearmain’s trailer on the property, authorities also found a pile of “well-worn” disassembled wood, metal and leather. UPDATES: Pot farm raid reveals horrifying tale of teen's captivity More than 1,200 marijuana plants were found on the property and destroyed, according to court documents. There are indications the girl may not have been the only victim. During a search of the Lakeport property, authorities found a ponytail of human hair inside Balletto’s gun safe, along with 17 guns and 4,000 in cash. Balletto’s girlfriend was staying at the home with their five children, officials said. The two face 10 years to life in prison but have yet to be charged in the alleged abuse of the teen.

Sign Up SAN FRANCISCO (KPIX 5) — Authorities said a 15-year-old girl was forced to work on a marijuana grow and sexually abused by two men in Northern California who allegedly locked her in a metal toolbox for days. The allegations against 30-year-old Ryan Balletto and 24-year-old Patrick Pearmain are outlined in a criminal complaint that was unsealed in federal court in San Francisco. Authorities alleged Balletto and Pearmain used the girl to cut marijuana buds at a Lake County property and had sex with her. The box where the girl was held captive was right next to a trailer on the grow operation property. The girl told police she spent at least 3 days locked inside the 4 by 2-foot case. Near the box, officers said they also found a noose and a rack to hold someone against their will, as well as other sex devices related to bondage. The girl told police that the men called her a “trooper” because she didn’t scream while being locked inside the box. The feds were already investigating the grow operation when the LAPD called Lake County authorities alerting them that a girl who had been reported missing in Los Angeles might have been kidnapped and held in Clearlake against her will. Along with more than a thousand marijuana plants, the cops also confiscated a stash of weapons, which they described as “the largest and most sophisticated bulk of weapons seized in recent Lake county Sheriff’s Office history.” As for the girl, authorities said she’s in a safe place now. One law enforcement source told KPIX 5 that there is some indication there may be more victims. The feds are asking if anyone else has been victimized by the suspects to alert the department of homeland security. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Balletto and Pearmain had retained attorneys.

The answer is now a tail-wagging “yes” as teams are welcoming pups to major league ballparks around the country. True dog days of summer have been in full swing for five years for Arizona Diamondbacks fans — both two- and four-legged — attending an annual Bark at the Park Day at Chase Field in Phoenix, and other ball clubs are offering or expanding special dog-friendly days as well. Ballparks are just another venue where pets are being encouraged to accompany their people, joining now-familiar sites like restaurants, shops, workplaces, classrooms and even some churches. The Diamondbacks introduced Bark in the Park in 2011 and this year expanded their pet-friendly options, teaming with PetSmart to offer Dog Days of Summer packages, which include semi-private spaces, each accommodating one dog and four people, access to dog parks and such treats as dog-friendly ice cream with kibble topping. “There are so many dog lovers, including myself, who would want to bring their pet to the ballpark,” D-backs President Derrick Hall tells PEOPLE. The new PetSmart patio already has been such a hit on Sundays, often selling out in advance, he said, that “we've already started adding some weekday games to the schedule.” Also new this year, the San Diego Padres joined with Petco to open the Barkyard, six semi-private, dog-friendly box seats in Petco Park's left-center field with such amenities as umbrellas for sun protection and artificial turf that keeps paws cool.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Please answer the following question: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity.

It was the first church in England built in the Romanesque style. The building was not completed until around 1090 but was consecrated on 28 December 1065, only a week before Edward's death on 5 January 1066. A week later he was buried in the church, and nine years later his wife Edith was buried alongside him. His successor, Harold II, was probably crowned in the abbey, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later the same year. Q: What style was the church rebuilt in?","completion":"The church of Westminster Abbey was rebuilt in the Romanesque style between 1042 and 1052 by King Edward the Confessor. This architectural style is characterized by its semi-circular arches, massive walls, large towers, and decorative arcading, which were influenced by Roman architecture. The Romanesque style was prevalent in European monastic and church architecture during the 11th and 12th centuries. Westminster Abbey was the first church in England to be built in this style, setting the stage for its widespread influence on English religious architecture in subsequent centuries. King Edward the Confessor started the rebuilding of St Peter's Abbey with the intention of establishing a royal burial church for himself and future monarchs. The construction was a lengthy process, taking nearly four decades to be completed, finally being consecrated on 28th December 1065. Unfortunately, King Edward passed away just a week later, on 5th January 1066. He was buried in the church according to his wishes, and nine years later, his wife Edith joined him in the burial site. Westminster Abbey then went on to play a major role in British history as the site of numerous significant events. It is believed that Harold II was crowned in the abbey, though the first well-documented coronation to take place there was that of William the Conqueror, which occurred later in 1066. Since then, Westminster Abbey has been the traditional coronation site for British monarchs and has also hosted various royal weddings and funerals. Throughout the centuries, Westminster Abbey has experienced various alterations and additions, reflecting the architectural trends of the times. For example, the Gothic style, which arrived in England during the 12th century, influenced the subsequent changes to the abbey's structure. The most notable Gothic addition is the Lady Chapel, commissioned by King Henry VII in the early 16th century and designed by architect Robert Stowell, which features intricate fan vaulting and the magnificent tombs of Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York. Today, Westminster Abbey remains a significant religious, historical, and cultural site that continues to attract millions of visitors every year. Besides its architectural marvel, the abbey also serves as the final resting place for numerous historical figures, including monarchs, statesmen, artists, and scientists, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Darwin, and Isaac Newton.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: Who plays Gwyn in the movie? Movie plot title: Princess of Thieves Movie plot: The film picks up years after the \\"known\\" events of the Robin Hood legend, centering on Robin's daughter, Gwyn, played by Knightley. As Maid Marian has died and Robin Hood (Stuart Wilson) is perpetually away battling in the Crusades, Gwyn has lived much of her life alone. She has grown up to be a strong-willed young woman with a talent for archery, much like her father. Her only friend is the sweet but plain Froderick (Del Synnott), who clearly is in love with her. Upon the death of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin returns to see that the proper man takes Richard's place as King of England. However, Robin is quickly foiled and imprisoned by his enemies, the Sheriff of Nottingham (Malcolm McDowell) and Prince John (Jonathan Hyde). It is then up to Gwyn to save the day. She must complete Robin's mission to find and protect the young Prince Philip (Stephen Moyer), who has just returned from exile in France to claim the throne â not an easy task since he has decided to forsake his true identity and is travelling anonymously under his valet's name (who died en route protecting his prince). Though she does fortuitously cross paths with the prince, she is not aware of his identity for much of the film. With a romantic spark budding between them, they must find the Merry Men and join forces to free her father from the tortures of the Tower of London before the evil Prince John ascends to the throne and brings England to ruin. After freeing her father, Gwyn along with her father and Prince Philip stop the coronation of Prince John. In the end when Philip is about to be crowned as king, Gwyn with a heavy heart tells him that she can only serve and work for him and they cannot be together. Robin later explains that he stayed out of Gwyn's life to protect her from the life he leads, but it didn't make any difference because she grew up to be just like him anyway. He then proposes a partnership between the two of them to serve Philip, with the only condition being that she take her orders from him (Robin) alone. She...

Read this: Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise. As such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool, and although it is used for this purpose, as it has an international legal credibility that others lack, other definitions have also been postulated. Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons. What does the treaty possess that others lack? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG) is a treaty that possesses an international legal credibility that others lack. This is because it is a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise, with the treaty being agreed upon, signed, and ratified by a majority of United Nations member states. The CPPCG was created in response to the atrocities committed during World War II, including the Holocaust. It sought to define and criminalize the act of genocide and establish a framework for its prevention and punishment. The treaty, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, came into force in 1951 and has since been ratified by most countries around the world. One of the critical elements of the CPPCG's unique credibility is its extensive ratification by a large number of countries. This widespread acceptance and adoption provide the treaty a level of legitimacy, authority, and international legal standing that other unofficial or alternative definitions may lack. Another factor contributing to the CPPCG's credibility is the cooperative and consensus-driven process that led to its creation. During the negotiations and drafting of the treaty, multiple countries had input and were able to reach a diplomatic compromise. This collaboration and consensus-building among various nations made the resulting treaty more globally palatable and accepted. However, as Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson pointed out, the wording of the treaty is not intended to serve as a strict or universally applicable research tool. This is because the CPPCG is a product of diplomatic negotiations that required compromise, which may have resulted in some ambiguities or limitations in its language and scope. As a result, other definitions of genocide have been postulated by scholars and researchers in an attempt to refine and build upon the treaty's framework. Despite these alternative definitions, none have gained widespread support due to various reasons, including their divergence from the internationally accepted CPPCG definition or the lack of consensus and international cooperation in their development. Therefore, the CPPCG remains the primary legal instrument with the international legal credibility that other definitions and frameworks may lack, making it a crucial tool in guiding efforts to prevent and punish acts of genocide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - write stories - talk to each other - go fishing - die of starvation - eat fish","completion":"Going fishing is the most suitable option to answer the question regarding what people do when they are near the sea. Fishing plays a significant role in the lives of those living in coastal areas, as well as tourists visiting these regions. Fishing not only provides an essential source of food for the people but also offers numerous socio-economic benefits. Fresh seafood is a popular nutritious diet option for those dwelling by the sea, and it is particularly rich in essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Eating fish is another activity closely related to being near the sea, as the abundance of this food source is often more accessible and affordable in comparison to inland areas. Additionally, fishing represents an integral part of the local economy in coastal regions, providing employment and fostering the growth of the fishing industry. This includes fishery-related jobs such as boat mechanics, fish processing and packaging, and shipbuilding. Many coastal communities thrive on their fishing economies, which range from small-scale, traditional fishing techniques to modern, commercial operations. Recreational fishing is also a popular pastime near the sea. Locals and tourists alike enjoy the experience of angling, spearfishing, or net casting. They may fish from piers, beaches, boats, or various other coastal structures. Recreational fishing attracts several forms of tourism to coastal areas, boosting local businesses that cater to the needs of the tourists. This includes lodging options, restaurants, and entertainment venues that offer maritime experiences, such as guided fishing tours or water sports activities. Moreover, the proximity to the sea offers an essential opportunity for maritime research, environmental conservation, and educational activities. Scientists and environmentalists study marine species, monitor ocean pollution, and engage in conservation efforts for various marine ecosystems. Educators and local environmental organizations often provide outreach programs that teach both adults and children about the importance of the marine environment and sustainable fishing practices. In conclusion, going fishing is the most appropriate answer to the question. Fishing in its various forms provides coastal communities with food, revenue, and recreational activities. It also enables the growth of the local economy through job creation and support industries, strengthens ongoing research and conservation efforts, and encourages individuals to appreciate the beauty and importance of the sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't. Which farmer didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids? Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.

GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them.

Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its 13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at 850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only 150. Other expenses included 1,619 for a 125 bootblack stand and 3,257 for a 325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\".Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures. He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost 18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost 24 million, and was still unfinished.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"Having less dishes in the rack does not directly impact any particular step of the dishwashing process. The steps remain the same no matter the number of dishes placed in the dishwasher: 1. Open the dishwasher 2. Slide out the bottom rack 3. Take a dirty plate 4. Rinse the plate 5. Place the dish in the rack 6. Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items 7. Fill the soap cup 8. Turn on the dishwasher However, having fewer dishes in the dishwasher may indirectly impact a step in the process. For example, during the \\"Repeat leaving enough space for water to reach all items\\" step, having fewer dishes in the rack means that there will be more space between each item. This could potentially lead to better cleaning as the water and soap will have more room to move around and clean each dish effectively. Additionally, more space between the dishes also ensures that there is less chance of dishes knocking against each other and potentially chipping or breaking. The placement of the dishes is an essential aspect of the process that is indirectly affected when there are fewer dishes in the rack. When loading the dishwasher, proper spacing is critical to ensure that the water and detergent can reach all surfaces of each item. Having fewer dishes in the rack can make it easier to achieve adequate spacing and may result in a higher likelihood of optimal cleaning. Furthermore, another indirect effect would be the water and energy consumption related to using the dishwasher. Having fewer dishes in the rack would still require the same amount of water and energy to complete a cycle as a fully loaded dishwasher. As a result, running the dishwasher when it is not full may lead to a waste of water and energy resources. In conclusion, the supposition of fewer dishes in the dishwasher rack does not directly impact any specific step of the process. Instead, it indirectly affects certain aspects of the process, such as increasing the spacing between dishes for better cleaning and potentially leading to energy and water waste.

Availability of personnel or resources: Depending on the nature of the work, there might have been a need for specific personnel or resources to be available to complete the task at hand. Their unavailability may have caused a delay in starting and completing the work on the lucets. 3. Unexpected tasks or interruptions: Throughout the day, various unexpected tasks or interruptions might have surfaced, demanding immediate attention. These incidents could have contributed to diverting time and attention away from the work on lucets, thus causing a delay in their completion. 4. Procrastination or poor time management: It's not uncommon for people to procrastinate or struggle with managing their time effectively. This could potentially lead to a delay in starting or completing a project, such as the work on lucets. 5. Complexity of the task: The work on lucets might have been more complex or time-consuming than initially anticipated. This increased complexity could have slowed down the progress, causing the work to extend beyond the expected timeline. 6. Insufficient planning: In some cases, a lack of proper planning might have contributed to the delay in completing the work. Things such as setting priorities, allocating resources, and estimating the time needed to complete a task are crucial for effective planning. The absence of a well-structured plan might have resulted in a delay. 7. Fatigue or health issues: Another possibility could be that the person responsible for working on the lucets might have been experiencing fatigue or some health issues. This would have negatively impacted their ability to focus and be productive, consequently delaying the work. 8. Sleep issues: As mentioned in the context, the person stayed up too late, and the alarm failed to wake them up properly. This could indicate that the person was exhausted, had sleeping issues, or faced distractions before bedtime that affected their ability to work efficiently on the lucets. In conclusion, various factors, such as technical problems, lack of resources, unexpected interruptions, procrastination, task complexity, inadequate planning, health issues, or sleep disturbances, might have contributed to the work on lucets not being completed before 5 PM. Identifying and addressing these issues could help ensure the timely completion of such tasks in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the female term equating to a phallic symbol?","completion":"The female term equating to a phallic symbol is the \\"yonic symbol.\\" While the phallic symbol represents the male genitalia and is often used to symbolize male potency, power, and fertility, the yonic symbol serves as its female counterpart. Yonic symbolism is based on the representation of the female genitalia, specifically the vulva or vagina, and is used to symbolize feminine power, fertility, and the divine feminine. Yonic symbols can be observed in various forms across different cultures, belief systems, and historical periods. These symbols often represent the great mother, goddesses, or other female archetypes, holding spiritual and cultural significance in their respective societies. Some common examples of yonic symbols include: 1. The Vesica Piscis: The Vesica Piscis is an ancient geometric shape created by the intersection of two circles with the same radius, with the center of each circle lying on the perimeter of the other. The resulting almond-shaped figure symbolizes the womb, the divine feminine, and the unity of male and female energies. It can be found in various religious and spiritual contexts, such as in Christian, Hindu, and Islamic art. 2. The Chalice: In many cultures, the chalice or cup has been a symbol of the feminine principle. It represents receptivity, nourishment, and the womb. The chalice is an important symbol in religious ceremonies, such as in the Christian tradition during the Eucharist, where it is used to hold the wine representing Jesus' blood. 3. The Labyrinth: The labyrinth is an ancient circular pattern that resembles the female reproductive system and symbolizes the complex path to inner knowledge and wisdom. It can be found in multiple spiritual traditions, such as the Cretan labyrinth used in Minoan culture, and the classical labyrinth often associated with Greek mythology, notably the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. 4. The Shell: Shells, especially those that resemble the shape of a spiral or a vulva, are often seen as yonic symbols. They can represent the origin of life, fertility, and protection. Examples of shells as yonic symbols are Aphrodite's birth from a seashell in Greek mythology and the association of seashells with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. 5. The Cave or Grotto: Caverns, caves, and grottoes are often potent yonic symbols representing the womb of Mother Earth and the source of life. These natural formations provide shelter and act as places of initiation and transformation in various mythologies and spiritual traditions. Examples include the Eleusinian mysteries in Ancient Greece, where initiates delved into underground chambers, and the significance of caves in the mythology of Native American tribes. These are just a few examples of yonic symbols; many more can be found across different cultures and historical periods. Just like phallic symbols, yonic symbols are integral to human culture and help us understand and appreciate the complexity, importance, and sacredness of feminine power, fertility, and the divine feminine."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In Russian, this can be translated as \\"Мне нужно\\" (Mne nuzhno), which means \\"I need to\\" or \\"I have to.\\" 2. \\"bypass\\" - The Russian word for \\"bypass\\" or \\"skip\\" is \\"обойти\\" (oboyti), which is a verb used in the context of avoiding or going around something. 3. \\"some of\\" - This phrase is translated as \\"некоторые из\\" (nekotorye iz) in Russian, meaning \\"some of\\" or \\"a few of.\\" 4. \\"these\\" - In Russian, \\"these\\" can be translated as \\"этих\\" (etikh), which is an adjective referring to a previously mentioned or nearby group of objects. 5. \\"Scriptures\\" - The Russian term for \\"Scriptures\\" (as in sacred religious texts) is \\"Священные Писания\\" (Svyashchennye Pisaniya). This term is composed of two words: \\"Священные\\" (Svyashchennye), meaning \\"sacred\\" or \\"holy,\\" and \\"Писания\\" (Pisaniya), meaning \\"writings\\" or \\"texts.\\" 6. \\"and\\" - In Russian, \\"and\\" as a joining word is translated as \\"и\\" (i). 7. \\"notes\\" - The Russian word for \\"notes\\" (as in written reminders or observations) is \\"заметки\\" (zametki).

So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint. All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.) Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD. So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one. What is the sentiment of this review?

Now, let's use these guidelines to find the answer: Step 1: Calculate the individual rates at which Pipe A and Pipe B can fill the tank. - Pipe A can fill the tank in 16 hours, so its rate is 1/16 per hour. - Pipe B can fill the tank in 24 hours, so its rate is 1/24 per hour. Step 2: Add the rates of Pipe A and Pipe B together to find the combined rate of filling the tank. Combined rate = (1/16) + (1/24) = (3/48) = 1/8 (per hour) Step 3: We need to find out how many hours it will take to fill 5/4 of the tank using this combined rate. Since the combined rate is 1/8 per hour, let's represent the time (in hours) needed to fill 5/4 of the tank as 'x'. We can write the equation: (1/8) * x = (5/4) Step 4: Solve for x. We can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 8: x = (5/4) * 8 = 5 * 2 = 10 hours So it will take 10 hours to fill 5/4 of the tank when both pipes are opened together.

I'd had the piggy bank for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't really remember getting it. My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it. I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry. My mother came in at the sound of the crash. \\"I'm so, so sorry!\\" I cried. \\"I broke the bank!

Given the question: Article: Parents, our first teachers, play a highly significant role in our lives.However, doesn't it seem that many of us come to have conflicts with them when we start high school? We're less likely to listen to them and take their suggestions--we even rebel against them. Why? It may be the so-called \\"generation gap\\".A generation gap appears when we begin to feel our parents are ignoring us, don't understand us, and we feel we can no longer share our feelings with them. The key reason is our desire for independence.In senior high school, we start to want to take responsibility for our own lives and make our own decisions.But parents resist this.They still want to control us and try to force us to do things they think we should do.Debate and discussion often come to nothing.Gradually, we talk with them less, and keep our feelings locked up inside. Zhang Xiaoyun, 16, of Ningbo, Zhejiang, has talked less and less with her mother since she started senior high school.\\"She believes studies should be my priority, not my inner world,\\" Zhang said.\\"Each day, she asks me the same old questions like, 'How was your last exam? or 'Have you made any progress in physics?\\" To Zhang, these questions are annoying and so she always tries to ignore them and answers _ .\\"Sometimes, when I get upset, I quarrel with her.After, she comes to apologize and comfort me.But I know, she doesn't completely understand me,\\" Zhang said.Now, a home that was once full of laughter has fallen into gloom and silence. The generation gap can be harmful.Because of the lack of communication, our parents no longer know what we are thinking about.There are quarrels, even over trivial things.When that happens, we may not be able to concentrate on our studies.Some of us even become afraid to go home after school-- a very serious situation for the whole family. Question: In the view of the author, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"parents should allow their children more freedom\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"parents should allow their children more freedom\\" aligns with the author's view. In the article, the author explains that conflicts between high school students and their parents often arise due to a generation gap. This disconnect stems from an adolescent's desire for independence, which clashes with their parents' inclination to maintain control over their lives. As teenagers grow older, they naturally begin to seek responsibility for their lives and make their own decisions. However, when parents try to impose their will and opinions, it can create disagreements, misunderstandings, and even drive a wedge between family members. Zhang Xiaoyun's story serves as an example of the problems that can arise when parents fail to grant their children the autonomy they crave. Her mother's incessant questioning and expectations only serve to cause irritation and frustration, making Zhang feel ignored and misunderstood. The resulting tension and lack of open communication have led the formerly harmonious home to become a gloomy, silent place. Now, the author highlights the potential damage that the generation gap can cause when not properly addressed. Parents' lack of understanding and acknowledgment of their children's feelings can lead to strained relationships, arguments over trivial matters, and an inability to focus on academics. In extreme cases, some students may even become afraid to return home after school, leading to severe consequences for the entire family. Consequently, in the view of the author, allowing young adults the freedom and autonomy necessary to explore their independence and take responsibility for their lives can help resolve conflicts, improve communication, and build more harmonious relationships within the family. While the author doesn't explicitly state that \\"parents should allow their children more freedom,\\" the underlying sentiment infers that a balance between guidance and freedom will foster a healthier environment for growth and development."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with a passage, and you need to write an **implausible** answer to to fill in the place of \\"_\\".

(d). natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well. Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

In the first sentence, the time phrase is placed at the beginning, giving more emphasis on when the event took place. In the second sentence, the time phrase is used as the opening phrase, shifting the focus to the chronological aspect of the events discussed. In the first sentence, more emphasis is placed on Slatyer's time spent in Paris by including the location with the time period.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The spores fall to the ground - The spores germinate - The spores begin to grow mycelium - The mycelium begin to sprout a bud - A new mushroom is formed. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process of mushroom formation is the production and release of spores from a mature mushroom. This process, known as sporulation, is crucial for the reproduction and propagation of fungi. Here is an updated and detailed outline of the complete process: 1. Sporulation: As a mature mushroom reaches the end of its lifecycle, it produces millions of tiny, microscopic spores, usually located within the gills, pores, or teeth of the mushroom cap. The production and release of spores depend on environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and airflow, as well as the specific mushroom species. 2. The spores fall to the ground: Once released from the parent mushroom, the spores are dispersed by air currents, rain, or even by insects and animals passing by. They eventually land on the ground or other suitable substrate, such as decaying wood, compost, or soil, that provides the necessary nutrients for their growth and development. 3. The spores germinate: When environmental conditions are optimal (correct temperature, moisture, and nutrients), the spores start to germinate, absorbing water and nutrients from their surroundings. This process initiates the development of new fungal cells, which grow by forming thin, thread-like structures called hyphae. 4. The spores begin to grow mycelium: As the hyphae continue to grow and branch out, they form a dense, interconnected network called mycelium. The mycelium serves as the main body of the fungus, playing a crucial role in absorbing nutrients and breaking down organic matter in the substrate, which allows the fungus to grow and reproduce. 5. The mycelium begins to sprout a bud: Under the right environmental conditions and once the mycelium has spread and gathered enough nutrients, it starts to form a small, compact mass of hyphae known as a primordium or \\"pin\\". This is the nascent stage of a new mushroom, which begins to differentiate into various structures, including the cap, stem, and gills, pores, or teeth, depending on the species. 6. A new mushroom is formed: The primordium continues to grow and develop into a fully-fledged mushroom, eventually emerging from the substrate and forming its recognizable shape. As the mushroom matures, it undergoes further growth and development, eventually producing spores of its own, thus completing the lifecycle and starting the process anew. In summary, the missing first step in the described process of mushroom formation is sporulation, where a mature mushroom produces and releases spores. This is the starting point of the reproductive process, which ultimately leads to the formation of new mushrooms and the continuation of the fungus' lifecycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It drifted towards shore near Dutch Harbor, a petty officer says. Shell Oil says it is investigating the incident. The Noble Discoverer is one of the ships Shell plans to use to drill in the Arctic. Article:","completion":"Title: Shell's Noble Discoverer Skirts the Edge of Disaster in Unalaska Bay: What This Incident Means for the Future of Arctic Drilling Introductory Paragraph: The Noble Discoverer, one of Shell Oil's key drilling vessels slated for Arctic exploration, was thrust into the limelight when it slipped its moorings in Unalaska Bay. As the world watched, the vessel drifted ominously towards the shore near Dutch Harbor—one of the busiest commercial fishing ports in the United States—before being secured by its crew and Coast Guard response teams. This incident highlights the concerns surrounding the potential risks and consequences of Arctic drilling, and Shell Oil's capability to manage them. Section 1: A Close Call in Unalaska Bay The Noble Discoverer, a 512-foot drillship contracted by Shell Oil to tap resources in the Arctic, endured an uneasy incident in Unalaska Bay. The U.S. Coast Guard reports that the vessel slipped its mooring and floated towards the shore, where it came dangerously close to the bustling port of Dutch Harbor. Thanks to the fast-acting crew and response teams, the situation was abated before it could escalate further. A Coast Guard petty officer revealed that the Noble Discoverer was anchored close to shore, and thankfully, there were no injuries or spills as a result of the incident. As questions surrounding the event swell, Shell Oil has launched an investigation to uncover the root cause, and to determine further steps to ensure the future safety of its vessels and the surrounding environment. Section 2: The Impact on Shell Oil's Arctic Drilling Plans This incident involving the Noble Discoverer inevitably casts a shadow over Shell Oil's controversial plans to explore the Arctic. As the world's largest fossil fuel producer pushes ahead with its proposed multi-billion dollar investment in the region, the events unfolding in Unalaska Bay raise red flags regarding the company's preparedness to tackle the logistical and environmental challenges associated with Arctic drilling. The potential impact of a mishap in the Arctic's delicate ecosystem, which plays a crucial role in maintaining global climate stability, is immense. Activists and environmental organizations argue that the disaster unfolding in Unalaska Bay could pale in comparison to what might unfold in the pristine Arctic waters if Shell's operations encounter similar, or even more disastrous, setbacks. Section 3: An Evolving Conversation about Arctic Drilling The Noble Discoverer's close call in Unalaska Bay serves as a stark reminder to the global community that the future of Arctic drilling remains fraught with risks. As Shell Oil's investigation into the incident continues, renewed scrutiny of the company's Arctic exploration plans is inevitable. The conversation surrounding Arctic drilling is evolving; the Unalaska Bay incident has reasserted the importance of safety measures, and magnified the potential impacts of human error and unforeseen complications. As a result, it is crucial for policymakers, industry leaders, and environmental activists alike to engage in an ongoing dialogue about the feasibility and risks associated with the exploration and exploitation of the world's final energy frontier. Conclusion: The Noble Discoverer's harrowing drift towards the shores of Dutch Harbor symbolizes the precarious balance between human ambition and the fragility of nature. As Shell Oil embarks on its quest to unlock the treasures buried beneath the Arctic, the Unalaska Bay incident prompts a profound reevaluation of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with drilling in one of the world's most delicately interconnected ecosystems. Only through a sincere commitment to safety, sustainable practices, and meaningful global cooperation can the promise of Arctic drilling be genuinely pursued and realized."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Player Development: Developing young talent into capable players forms the backbone of any successful football club. Hughes' experience in nurturing talent, particularly in Welsh soccer, might help Blackburn Rovers identify and establish new talent, driving the future success of the club. 5. Local Support and Fanbase: Engaging a beloved Welsh manager like Mark Hughes could garner support from fans, especially those from Wales who follow Blackburn Rovers. This increased fan support can boost the club's image, fan engagement, and overall revenue. To establish negotiations with the manager, Blackburn Rovers must first obtain permission from the FAW, which oversees the national team's affairs. This procedural step is not only a sign of respect for the governing body but also an indicator of the club's adherence to professional norms and ethics. If the FAW grants Blackburn Rovers permission to approach Mark Hughes, it could result in a series of negotiations to determine the terms of engagement, including the length of the contract, remuneration, and performance stipulations. Hughes would undoubtedly need to consider his options and weigh the benefits of his current role as the national team manager against the opportunity to manage a club with the stature, history, and resources of Blackburn Rovers. In conclusion, Blackburn Rovers' interest in Mark Hughes is a significant development in the soccer world, and their request for permission to speak with him showcases their intent to hire a talented and respected manager. Should the talks be successful, it could mark a turning point in the club's trajectory, positively impacting their performance, talent development, and fanbase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Two teams of scientists were in Antarctica to study the weather. Camp Alpha was located in East Antarctica, while camp Omega was situated in West Antarctica. But I can use this background: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.

Summarize this article: A letter signed by 15 physicians warns that if attacks on medical facilities continue at their present rate, there could be none left within a month. US inaction against crimes by Syria's government and its ally Russia means it bears equal responsibility, it argues. Russian forces, meanwhile, were due to halt actions in Aleppo to allow in aid. All military activity, air and artillery strikes would be suspended between 10:00 (07:00 GMT) and 13:00 (10:00 GMT) each day from Thursday, a defence ministry official said. However, the United Nations said three hours would be insufficient to help the millions in need and appealed for 48-hour pauses. Fighting has escalated in recent days, with rebels severing the government's main route to the west of the city. The offensive sought to break a siege by pro-government forces, who encircled the east in July with the support of Russian aircraft. The letter, signed by 15 of the doctors remaining in eastern Aleppo, says that five years into the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, doctors have \\"borne witness as countless patients, friends and colleagues suffered violent, tormented deaths\\". \\"The world has stood by and remarked how 'complicated' Syria is, while doing little to protect us. Recent offers of evacuation from the regime and Russia have sounded like thinly veiled threats to residents - flee now or face what fate?\\" They say that in the past month there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of them on hospitals where they work. \\"Two weeks ago, four newborn babies gasping for air suffocated to death after a blast cut the oxygen supply to their incubators. Gasping for air, their lives ended before they had really begun,\\" they recall. The doctors warn President Obama: \\"Continued US inaction to protect the civilians of Syria means that our plight is being wilfully tolerated by those in the international corridors of power. The burden of responsibility for the crimes of the Syrian government and its Russian ally must therefore be shared by those, including the United States, who allow them to continue.\\" Unless a permanent lifeline to rebel-held Aleppo is opened, they add, \\"it will be only a matter of time until we are again surrounded by regime troops, hunger takes hold and hospitals' supplies run completely dry.\\" \\"We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers, we need your action. Prove that you are the friend of Syrians.\\" An earlier statement sent to the media had said there were 29 signatories to the letter, and also quoted it as calling on Mr Obama to impose a no-fly zone over Aleppo. On Monday, the UN said countless civilians had been killed or injured over the past few weeks in the city, and that the targeting of hospitals and clinics had continued unabated. Moreover, attacks on civilian infrastructure had left more than two million people without electricity or access to the public water network for several days, it added.","completion":"Fifteen doctors have penned a letter warning that, if attacks on medical facilities by Russia and the Syrian government continue at their present rate, there could be none left within a month.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question...an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of atp??","completion":"An enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is known as ATP synthase. ATP synthase is a complex enzyme that plays a critical role in the process of cellular respiration, specifically, in the production of energy in mitochondria (in eukaryotic cells) and bacterial membranes (in prokaryotic cells). ATP synthase is an essential enzyme as it serves as a catalyst in the conversion of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) into ATP, which is the primary energy currency in living organisms. This enzyme establishes a proton gradient across the membrane, utilizing the energy stored in the form of this electrochemical gradient to produce ATP - a process known as chemiosmosis. The structure of ATP synthase is highly conserved across different species, reflecting its importance and effectiveness in energy production. This enzyme consists of two major subunits: F0 and F1. The F0 subunit is embedded within the membrane, responsible for establishing the proton gradient, while the F1 subunit is exposed to the matrix in the mitochondria or the cytoplasm in bacterial cells, where it binds ADP and Pi to form ATP. The F0 subunit consists of integral membrane proteins, which include subunits a, b, and c. The movement of protons through the F0 subunit ultimately results in the rotation of the c-ring, a set of subunit c proteins, which in turn causes conformational changes in the F1 subunit, ultimately driving ATP synthesis. The F1 subunit is composed of five different polypeptide chains (α, β, γ, δ, and ε). The α and β subunits occur in alternating order, forming a hexameric structure (comprising three of each subunit). These subunits create nucleotide-binding sites, where ADP and Pi bind, and where ATP synthesis occurs. The γ subunit connects the F0 and F1 subunits, assisting in the transmission of energy derived from proton movement to the site of ATP synthesis. The process by which ATP synthase functions is called oxidative phosphorylation. This mechanism involves the electron transport chain (ETC), generating the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (in eukaryotic cells) or the bacterial membrane (in prokaryotic cells) driving the synthesis of ATP through the action of ATP synthase. Upon passing through the F0 subunit of the ATP synthase complex, protons move into the matrix or cytoplasm, and the energy released as a result of this movement is harnessed for ATP synthesis. In summary, ATP synthase is a vital enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in living organisms by utilizing the energy derived from proton movement across a membrane. This enzyme consists of two major subunits, F0 and F1, which work together to facilitate the production of ATP, the primary energy currency used by cells to drive various biochemical processes and maintain life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches - And a butterfly is born. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during pollination happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process you've mentioned explains the different stages of a butterfly's life cycle, which includes: 1. Egg (larva is born) 2. Caterpillar (larva) stage (it eats constantly and grows) 3. Chrysalis (pupa) stage (the caterpillar forms a cocoon around itself) 4. Emerging adult (the cocoon hatches, and an adult butterfly is born) Now, let's address the perturbation hypothesis, which involves pollination. Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred from the anther (male part) of a flower to the stigma (female part) of the same or another flower, leading to the fertilization of ovules and the production of seeds and fruits. Butterflies play a significant role in the pollination of many flowering plants as they visit flowers while feeding on nectar. When butterflies visit these flowers, pollen grains stick to their bodies and are transferred from one flower to another, promoting cross-pollination. It is important to note that the process of pollination is separate from the butterfly life cycle process. However, they are related, as both processes occur in the same ecosystem. Now, let's consider the proposed perturbation, i.e., an increase in pollination during the butterfly life cycle. This increase in pollination could have both direct and indirect effects on the butterfly population. Direct Effects: 1. Enhanced plant reproduction and growth: The increase in pollination would lead to better reproduction rates, a larger number of seeds, and the subsequent growth of more plants. This would result in an abundance of food sources, such as leaves and flowers, for caterpillars and adult butterflies, thus potentially leading to a higher survival rate and an increase in butterfly numbers. Indirect Effects: 1. Greater biodiversity: A higher rate of successful pollination may lead to an increase in plant biodiversity. This increased biodiversity can support a more diverse ecosystem, providing various resources and habitats to different species, including butterflies. A more diverse ecosystem may, in turn, contribute to more stable butterfly populations. 2. Better ecological balance: The increase in plant growth and biodiversity due to more pollination can have cascading effects on the overall ecosystem. It may create habitats that protect and nurture butterfly eggs, caterpillars, pupae, and adults while supporting the availability of other resources required for their successful reproduction. Such ecosystem balance may contribute to the stability or increase in butterfly numbers. In conclusion, the perturbation of increased pollination might not directly affect the butterfly's life cycle process. However, it may lead to an increase in the availability of food and suitable habitats, as well as improved biodiversity and ecological balance, which can indirectly support a rise in the butterfly population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms?

The decision was delivered in a packed courtroom on [insert date here], as Reeva Steenkamp's family members, friends, and supporters waited with bated breath for the verdict. Backdrop (Provide context to readers) Before diving into the details of the Supreme Court's decision, it is important to understand the background of the case. Oscar Pistorius, a double amputee who made history by competing in both the Paralympic and Olympic Games, has been a household name in South Africa and across the globe. However, his life took a tragic turn on February 14, 2013, when he fatally shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, through a locked bathroom door at their home in Pretoria. Initial Trial and Conviction (Recall past significant events which occurred prior to this decision) Pistorius claimed the shooting was a tragic accident, believing he was firing at an intruder in his home. In his trial, he was initially convicted of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, and sentenced to a five-year prison term. This conviction was met with skepticism by many, who believed Pistorius should have been found guilty of a more severe charge. Appeal and Murder Conviction (Detail the appeal trial's events and the ultimate ruling) Fast-forward to the appeal trial, where Pistorius's conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal. The court ruled that the initial trial judge made errors in her interpretation and application of the law. This led to a reconsideration of the evidence and testimony, ultimately culminating in the murder conviction. With a calm, steady voice, the presiding judge at the Supreme Court of Appeal announced the guilty verdict, stating, \\"Oscar Pistorius is guilty of murder.\\" The courtroom, filled with members of the media, legal teams, and Reeva Steenkamp's family, fell silent as the magnitude of the decision settled in. Implications for Pistorius (Discuss potential consequences following the verdict) As a result of this ruling, Oscar Pistorius now faces a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp. The actual sentencing will be determined at a later date, and it remains to be seen whether any mitigating factors will be considered in the final decision. Reactions to the Verdict (Mention statements from Steenkamp's family and Pistorius's defense team) Reporters swarmed the Steenkamp family following the announcement, seeking their reactions to the verdict. In an emotional statement, Steenkamp's parents expressed relief and gratitude for the outcome, emphasizing their belief that justice had been served for their daughter. Conversely, Pistorius's defense team expressed disappointment in the verdict, stating that they are considering further legal options – including the possibility of taking the case to South Africa's highest court, the Constitutional Court. Conclusion The Oscar Pistorius trial has captivated international audiences for years, stirring strong emotions and sparking debates on issues such as disability, domestic violence, and South Africa's complex legal system. With this monumental decision, the case has reached a pivotal point, and the world now waits to hear the final sentencing for a man once hailed as a hero – a gripping tale of triumph, tragedy, and the pursuit of justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Doctor Dolittle Movie plot: During the opening credits, which feature animations of various animals, the orchestra plays an overture of three songs from the film, most notably \\"Talk to the Animals.\\" The action begins in the quaint 19th century English seaside village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. Matthew Mugg, an Irish fishmonger, meets his young friend Tom Stubbins, as Matt wheels his fish barrow around the wharf collecting fresh seafood for his customers. Matthew rescues an injured duck from a fisherman who intends to eat it for his dinner. As soon as Matthew finishes his rounds, he tells Tom they will take the duck to John Dolittle, the greatest animal doctor in the world. Matthew explains that Dolittle talks to the animals to determine what ails them. To explain further, Matthew sings \\"My Friend the Doctor.\\" During the song Tom accompanies Matthew as he makes his deliveries to his customers. By the time the song ends, they have arrived at Dolittle's house. When a chimpanzee and a parrot answer the door, Matthew introduces Chee-Chee and Polynesia to Tom. After the introductions, they go into the library where Dr. Dolittle is trying to converse with some goldfish. He explains to Matthew and Tom that he is attempting to gather information about the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail. He soon plans to embark on a voyage to find the creature. Tom takes the duck out of his coat where he has been keeping it safe and hands it to the doctor. After a few quacks back and forth, Dolittle is certain that the drake has had a row with his wife. The doctor invites Tom and Matthew to dinner and instructs Polynesia, the parrot, to prepare for two more guests. Tom and Matthew had encountered a thunderstorm on the way to Dolittle's, so the good doctor furnishes them with dry clothes. When they return from changing out of their wet togs, Chee-Chee is frying sausages and bacon while a pig is squealing his displeasure. The doctor doesn't join them for dinner.

Write an article based on this summary: More than half of Devon's libraries could close under proposals being considered by the county council. Article:","completion":"Title: Devon's Libraries at Risk: County Council Considers Closure of Over 50% of Local Resources Introduction: The future of libraries in Devon may be bleak as the county council is currently considering proposals that could lead to the closure of more than half their local libraries. Background on the Situation: The county council is facing budget constraints, pushing them to explore avenues for saving costs. With libraries being an integral part of community resources, their closure could leave countless residents of the area affected and lacking valuable access to free resources. The Significance of Libraries: Libraries have long been essential to fostering education and promoting literacy within communities. They provide free access to literature, computers, and other useful resources, and also offer services such as job-seeking workshops, after-school programs, and activities for seniors. The closure of over half of Devon's libraries is a cause for concern, as it could leave many residents without access to these valuable resources. Implications of the Closure: The closure of more than half of Devon's libraries could significantly impact various demographics within the community. In addition to the residents who rely on these local resources, library staff members may also face job losses. Furthermore, closures could exacerbate social isolation for seniors, hinder children and young people's educational development, and create difficulties for job-seekers looking for assistance. Possible Solutions: To prevent the proposed closures from taking place, the county council may explore alternative solutions. One such solution could involve seeking external funding or support from local businesses, charities, or organizations. Another option may involve implementing cost-cutting measures within the libraries themselves, such as reducing opening hours, streamlining staff, or incorporating more digital resources. Public Opinion: It is critical for the residents of Devon to voice their opinions on the potential library closures, as well as contribute ideas on how to save their valuable local resources. Public meetings, social media campaigns, and petitions could be effective in raising awareness and encouraging community involvement in the decision-making process. Conclusion: With the possibility of over 50% of Devon's libraries facing closure under the county council's proposal, it is essential to both assess the impact on the community and explore alternative solutions to the budget constraints. The future of Devon's libraries depends on the input and support of all residents, highlighting the importance of community-driven decision-making."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which player caught the longest TD pass?","completion":"Title: The Player with the Longest Touchdown Pass Ever! Once upon a time, in the magical world of American football, there was a super cool record that everyone talks about even today! This record is all about the longest touchdown (TD) pass ever caught. Touchdown is when a player takes the football and crosses the other team's goal line. The pass is a nice toss from one player to another. So, do you want to know who caught the longest TD pass and became a legend? Gather around, and let me tell you the amazing story! In the far away land of the National Football League (NFL), where strong football players run around on a big green field, there were two awesome players, Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill, who played for the Kansas City Chiefs! They were great friends but also teammates. One sunny day, on September 29, 2019, they were playing a football game against a team called the Detroit Lions. It was a big, big match where everyone was cheering and having fun. In the middle of the game, Patrick Mahomes had the football, and he wanted to help his team get closer to winning. He looked around and saw his friend Tyreek Hill, who was really far away. But Patrick knew that Tyreek could run as fast as the wind! So, Patrick threw the football high into the sky, towards Tyreek. The football flew and flew, like a beautiful bird in the sky. It went soooo far, nearly 69 yards! That's longer than half of the whole football field! Tyreek saw the football coming, and he didn't want to let his friend down. He ran as fast as he could, like a superhero, and with his powerful hands, he caught the football! Then, he kept running to cross the goal line and scored a touchdown for his team! Everyone was amazed, and they couldn't believe their eyes! Together, Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill had just made history! They broke the record and became the heroes who caught the longest TD pass ever! So now, whenever people talk about the longest touchdown passes in American football, they will always remember the fantastic day when Patrick Mahomes and Tyreek Hill showed everyone how teamwork and friendship can create magical moments on the football field. And that, my little friends, is the story of the player who caught the longest TD pass of all time! The end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I thought \\"What's New Scooby-Doo\\" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I didn't like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \\"Teen Titans\\" or \\"Loonatics Unleashed\\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \\"comical\\" impressions and gives safety tips (\\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \\"Lightning Strikes Twice,\\" they use the \\"Castle thunder\\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \\"Castle thunder\\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \\"Castle thunder\\" on \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \\"What's New Scooby-Doo!\\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \\"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \\"Pirates Ahoy\\" movie was actually BETTER than \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" (and even better than \\"What's New, Scooby-Doo!\\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise.

Information: - Phylloscopidae is a newly described family of small insectivorous birds formerly placed in the Old World warbler family. Phylloscopidae contains two genera, \\"Phylloscopus\\" and \\"Seicercus\\", respectively containing around 55 and 11 species. The leaf warblers are a branch of \\"Old World warblers,\\" one of 10 or more branches that sprouted as Families with the break-up of the Sylviidae. - The aberrant bush warbler ( Horornis flavolivaceus ) is a species of bush warbler ( family Cettiidae ) . It was formerly included in the \`\` Old World warbler '' assemblage . It is found in central and southern China , and the northern extremes of Burma and Vietnam . - A kinglet, or crest, is a small bird in a group that is sometimes included in the Old World warblers, but is frequently placed in its own family, Regulidae, because of resemblance to titmice. \\"Regulidae\\" is derived from the Latin word \\"regulus\\" for \\"petty king\\" or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are seven species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, \\"Regulus madeirensis\\", was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to occasionally be afforded its own genus, \\"Corthylio\\". Description. Kinglets are among the smallest of all passerines, ranging in size from and weighing ; the sexes are the same size. They have medium-length wings and tails, and small needle-like bills. The plumage is overall grey-green, offset by pale wingbars, and the tail tip is incised. Five species have a single stiff feather covering the nostrils, but in the ruby-crowned kinglet, this is replaced by several short, stiff bristles. Most kinglets have distinctive head markings, and the males possess a colourful crown patch. In the females, the crown is duller and yellower. The long feathers forming the central crown stripe can be erected; they are inconspicuous most of the time, but are used in courtship and territorial displays when the raised crest is very striking. - Cettia is a genus of small insectivorous songbirds (\\"warblers\\") which make up the core of the newly recognized family Cettiidae. They were formerly placed in the Sylviidae, which at that time was a wastebin taxon for the warbler-like Sylvioidea. The range of this genus extends from Europe to southeast Asia. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A songbird is a bird belonging to the clade Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). Another name that is sometimes seen as a scientific or vernacular name is Oscines, from Latin \\"oscen\\", \\"a songbird\\". This group contains some 4,000 species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. A smaller family of warblers, together with some babblers formerly placed in the family Timaliidae and the parrotbills, are retained in a much smaller family Sylviidae. - The Acrocephalidae (the reed warblers, marsh- and tree-warblers, or acrocephalid warblers) are a family of oscine passerine birds, in the superfamily Sylvioidea. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Sylviidae is a family of passerine birds that was part of an assemblage known as the Old World warblers. The family was a wastebin taxon with over 400 species of bird in over 70 genera. Advances in classification, particularly helped with molecular data, have led to the splitting out of several new families from within this group. Today the smaller family Sylviidae includes the typical warblers in the genus \\"Sylvia\\", the parrotbills of Asia (formerly a separate family Paradoxornithidae), a number of babblers formerly placed within the family Timaliidae (which is being split) and the wrentit, a North American bird that has been a longstanding taxonomic mystery. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small insectivorous songbirds (\\"warblers\\"), formerly placed in the Old World warbler \\"wastebin\\" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (\\"Cettia\\") and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. - The Cisticolidae family of small passerine birds is a group of about 110 warblers found mainly in warmer southern regions of the Old World. They are often included within the Old World warbler family Sylviidae.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Answer the following question: Who will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","completion":"Bobby will cause more carbon dioxide to be used in the ponds near his farm. This is because he has dramatically increased his use of fertilizer due to the large order of potatoes he received. The rain will dissolve the excess fertilizer in the soil and carry it into the nearby ponds. The increased nitrogen in the water will cause algae to grow out of control, using up more carbon dioxide in the process. Since Kenny's use of fertilizer is currently low, he will contribute less to this issue compared to Bobby."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: The global financial crisis is likely to cause increased mental health problems as people struggle to deal with poverty and unemployment, the World Health Organization warned Thursday. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are already affected by mental problems such as depression and bipolar disorders and the current market meltdown could worsen feelings of despair among people who can't stand such illnesses. The United Nations agency said the impact could be especially marked for those living in low and middle income countries where access to treatment is often limited. \\"We should not be surprised at the turbulence and likely consequences of the current financial crisis.Now we are seeing a huge gap in taking care of people in great need,\\" WHO director general Margaret Chan told at a meeting of mental health experts. \\"It should not come as a surprise that we continue to see more stresses, suicides and mental disorders,\\" Chan warned. Benedetto Saraceno, director of WHO's mental health, said mental health disorders affected one in four people at some point in their lives. Mental and neurological disorders are often chronic and disabling, he said.Nearly 1 million people commit suicide worldwide every year, a large part of them are young adults. Asked about the financial crisis, Saraceno said, \\"Poverty can be the consequence of such events, the debts, despair and sense of loss that may reach middle and lower classes.Even the poor can be affected by this crisis.\\" \\"There is clear evidence that suicide is linked to financial disasters.I am not talking about the millionaire's jumping out of the window but about poor people,\\" he said.The global crisis could be expected to affect the \\"stability of communities and families\\", according to Saraceno.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: The dynasty that ruled Germany in the High Middle Ages was replaced by which dynasty? Context: During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term. Is this statement correct \\"could a president run for a third term\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"could a president run for a third term\\" is incorrect according to the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment specifically prohibits an individual from being elected to the office of the President more than twice. Additionally, if an individual has held or acted as the President for over two years of a presidential term that was initially intended for someone else, they may only run for the office of the President once. Section 1 of the Twenty-second Amendment clearly states that no person can be elected as President more than twice, so running for a third term is not allowed unless specific conditions mentioned in the amendment apply. For example, the amendment does not apply to any person who held the office of President when the amendment was proposed by Congress. Furthermore, if a person is holding or acting as the President when the amendment becomes operative, they would still be allowed to serve the remainder of their term. However, given the current context and the fact that the amendment has been in effect since 1951, it is safe to assume that no president in the United States today could run for a third term in accordance with the Twenty-second Amendment. The amendment was designed to prevent a concentration of power in one individual for an extended period and to maintain a system of checks and balances in the government."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(2) Unionville is an unlawful community in Massac County , Illinois , United States Brookport is east of Unionville . Do these two sentences mean the same thing? Options are: [A]. no. [B]. yes.","completion":"[A]. No. These two statements convey different meanings. Let us break down each sentence to understand the differences better. (1) \\"Unionville is an unincorporated community in Massac County, Illinois, United States. Unionville is east of Brookport.\\" In this statement, Unionville is described as an \\"unincorporated community\\" in Massac County, Illinois, United States. This means that Unionville is not governed by its own local municipal government, but instead is administered as part of the larger Massac County. Also, the statement is about the relative location of Unionville, stating that it is east of Brookport. In other words, Brookport is west of Unionville. (2) \\"Unionville is an unlawful community in Massac County, Illinois, United States. Brookport is east of Unionville.\\" In this statement, Unionville is described as an \\"unlawful community\\" in Massac County, Illinois, United States. This means that Unionville might have some illegal activities or the place does not have permission from the local authorities to exist. However, the description of Unionville as an \\"unlawful community\\" is likely a mistake, as the term \\"unlawful\\" is not generally used to describe a community. Instead, it is possible that the sentence intended to say \\"unincorporated community,\\" like in the first sentence, but was miswritten. Additionally, the statement turns the focus on Brookport, saying that it is east of Unionville. The original statement tells us that Unionville is east of Brookport, and this statement confirms that by saying Brookport is east of Unionville, which implies that Unionville is still to the west of Brookport. The main difference between these two sentences is the way Unionville is described - as an \\"unincorporated\\" community in the first sentence and as an \\"unlawful\\" community in the second. Furthermore, the first sentence emphasizes the location of Unionville concerning Brookport, while the second sentence focuses on Brookport's location concerning Unionville.

The ban gives a harder time to schools tying to earn money,because of budget difficulties. Bake sales have proven to be highly profitable toward schools with young people because the start-up costs are very small.

New York Education advisors are considering alternative options for raising money, including selling healthier foods, like vegetables, or conducting walk-a-thons. Step 2: Assess all the given options. A: The bake sales - These were mentioned as profitable; however, they may contribute to overweight among school children, so they aren't considered healthy. B: The vegetables sales - These are healthy, but the article implies that students might not be interested in buying them, so the profitability is questionable. C: The walk-a-thons - This option is mentioned as an alternative being conducted throughout New York schools. Walk-a-thons promote physical activity, which is healthy and the article does not state any issues about it not being profitable. D: The food product sales - This option is too vague to determine whether it is healthy or profitable, as it depends on the types of food products being sold. Step 3: Choose the option that fits the criteria of being both healthy and profitable for schools. Based on the analysis, I choose option C: The walk-a-thons because they encourage physical activity and are healthy for students, and the article does not mention any concerns about profitability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence states that pubs are \\"primarily alcohol-serving establishments,\\" which implies that the main provision offered by a pub is the service of alcoholic beverages. Moreover, the sentence distinguishes pubs from other related establishments, like hotels and restaurants, whose primary focus is on providing lodging or food services, respectively. To provide a more detailed and direct answer to the question, it would be appropriate to say that the main provision of a pub is to function as a gathering place where customers can socialize, enjoy alcoholic beverages, and sometimes engage in leisure activities such as watching sports events or playing pool. Most pubs also offer food options, ranging from traditional pub fare to more elaborate dishes, but their primary focus remains on providing a welcoming atmosphere for consuming alcohol in a social setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health. For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. \\"Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection.

It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .\\" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. \\"And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect.

Options: - bankruptcy - fear - guilty conscience - great sorrow - find god Explain why a human would choose \\"great sorrow\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"Great sorrow A human would choose \\"great sorrow\\" as the answer to the question because it most accurately reflects the emotional toll that committing murder would have on the family of the murdered individual. When a family loses a loved one, especially in a violent and unjust manner like murder, the grief and pain they experience can be overwhelming, leading to a deep sense of sorrow and longing for their lost family member. Bankruptcy, fear, and guilty conscience might be potential consequences of murder, but they don't directly relate to the emotional impact on the family of the murdered person. Bankruptcy could be a side effect if the murdered individual was the primary breadwinner, but it doesn't reflect the emotional pain the family would feel. Fear could be experienced by the family if they feel unsafe or fear retribution; however, it doesn't capture their emotional response to the loss itself. Guilty conscience would be more applicable to the person who committed the murder rather than the family of the victim. Finally, \\"find god\\" might be a potential coping mechanism for some family members as they seek solace and guidance in their faith, but it doesn't specifically describe the emotional distress that the family would go through following the murder. Therefore, \\"great sorrow\\" would be the most appropriate choice as it best represents the collective emotional experience of the family of the murdered person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fortunately, the number of tests performed usually drops in the third and final trimester as long as both mother and baby are deemed to be healthy, and there are no other complications. Urine testing, however, will continue to monitor the protein levels and to detect any unusual bacteria. Testing for GBS, a bacteria that is normally present in the intestines, is standard between 35 to 37 weeks. If GBS infects your baby, it can cause serious illness. The test involves taking swabs from the anal and genital regions to test for traces of the bacteria. If you test positive for the bacterium, you will likely be given antibiotics during labor to protect your baby. If you don’t feel your baby moving, are past your due date, carrying more than one baby, or have chronic health conditions, your doctor may ask you to measure the amount of time it takes your baby to move ten times while lying on your side. The best time to do this test is directly after eating as this is when babies tend to be most active. If the baby does not kick at least 10 times in two hours or if the number of moves seems to be decreasing, your doctor may order additional testing. If you have risk factors such as chronic health conditions or are carrying multiples, this test may be conducted more than once beginning at 32 weeks (possibly earlier). A strap will be placed around your abdomen to monitor the baby’s heartbeat. The test usually takes anywhere from 20 – 40 minutes. A baby whose heart rate doesn’t rise when he moves may simply be sleeping. Your doctor will try to wake the baby using a buzzer placed on the belly. If the problem persists, further testing will be done. If your baby is overdue or if you’ve had many complications throughout your pregnancy, your healthcare provider may want to complete a biophysical profile. The test involves an ultrasound combined with the nonstress test, and helps the doctor to determine whether your baby may benefit from being delivered as soon as possible. For example, if your level of amniotic fluid is low, your doctor may wish to deliver the baby as soon as possible.","completion":"This article discusses various tests performed during the third trimester of pregnancy to ensure the health of both mother and baby, including urine testing, GBS testing, fetal movement monitoring, nonstress tests, and biophysical profiles to determine if immediate delivery is necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the air have increased over the last decade dramatically, and carbon dioxide is the chief culprit in the increased threat of global warming in recent decades. Given these facts, what has led to the increase in global warming among the following options: - Greenhouse gases - movements in the earth's crust - Increase in carbon dioxide - Greenhouse gasses - forest is destroyed - Burning fuel and air - movement of tectonic plates - tectonic plates being pushed together Answer:","completion":"The primary factor leading to the increase in global warming among the given options is the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. There are several contributing factors to this increase, which include: 1. Increase in carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere through various natural processes, such as respiration and volcanic eruptions. However, human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), have significantly increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. This excess CO2 traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing global warming. 2. Deforestation: Forests play a crucial role in absorbing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. When forests are destroyed, either through logging or conversion to agricultural land, the stored CO2 is released back into the environment. Additionally, the loss of forests means fewer trees are available to absorb CO2, which further increases atmospheric CO2 levels. 3. Burning fuel and air: As mentioned earlier, the combustion of fossil fuels, such as petrol, diesel, and natural gas, in industrial processes, power generation, and transportation, is the primary source of human-generated CO2 emissions. The burning of fuel releases the stored carbon within, combining it with oxygen in the air to form CO2. This process contributes to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although movements in the Earth's crust, tectonic plate activities, and the Earth's volcanic activity do release CO2 and other greenhouse gases over geological timescales, these processes are not significant contributors to the recent rapid increase in global warming observed over the last century. The primary driver of the current global warming trend is human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence: Reagan was shot with a bow","completion":"The sentence \\"Reagan was shot with a bow\\" is not true based on the given text. The text states that President Ronald Reagan was wounded by a bullet fired by John Hinckley Jr. in an attempted assassination. There is no mention of a bow or an arrow, just a bullet. Therefore, the accurate version of the sentence should be: \\"Reagan was shot with a gun.\\" On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan was leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel after delivering a speech when John Hinckley Jr. attempted to assassinate him. Hinckley fired six shots from a revolver, one of which ricocheted off the presidential limousine and hit Reagan in the chest, puncturing his lung. Despite being seriously wounded, Reagan was taken to George Washington University Hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet and repair the damage. Reagan's recovery was indeed remarkable, he managed to maintain his sense of humor throughout the ordeal, famously quipping to the surgeons, \\"I hope you're all Republicans.\\" He was able to return to the White House only 12 days after the assassination attempt. Reagan's swift recovery and resilience in the face of the assassination attempt enhanced his image as a strong and determined leader in the eyes of the American public. John Hinckley Jr.'s motive for the assassination attempt was to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Following a trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was committed to a psychiatric hospital. After being confined in different institutions for more than 30 years, Hinckley was eventually released in 2016 with several restrictions. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Reagan was shot with a bow\\" is not true based on the given text, as it is clear that he was wounded by a bullet fired by John Hinckley Jr., not by an arrow shot from a bow. Ronald Reagan's recovery from this assassination attempt was indeed remarkably speedy, and his resilience in the face of adversity has become an important part of his legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chinese characters Although most often associated with the People's Republic of China, character simplification predates the 1949 communist victory. Caoshu, cursive written text, almost always includes character simplification, and simplified forms have always existed in print, albeit not for the most formal works. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the Communist Party of China) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the Latin script, and spawned such inventions as the Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Q: What almost always includes character simplification?","completion":"Caoshu, also known as cursive written text, almost always includes character simplification.

I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival, and it is one of the best I've seen this year. Seeing it on a big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those TV screens most cinemas have) with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience, as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story, into the picture. The movie presents a set of characters, which are loosely inter-connected. Their stories cross at certain points, and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films. But the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the entire movie. It houses the characters, contains the pavements and roads on which they walk, and sets the background atmosphere for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. The movie returns again and again to certain themes (shoes, for instance), and in essence Salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses. He combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters, and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background. A set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters. One excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time. It might not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen. The message of the movie is very positive, and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times. The music along the movie is usually pop, with a few instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day, although I seriously doubt I will). All together, I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling, and I'm not easily impressed (you'll have to take my word for it). For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10.

A group of us stayed at Excalibur for a few days during New Year's and the rates we got were awesome, we booked our rooms at 51/night and when we got there, we upgraded to one of the newly modelled Widescreen Rooms which was only another 20/ night... The reason I wanted to stay at Excalibur was because of its location and for the price we were staying there for, who could pass it up? Before this visit to Vegas, we would find ourselves travelling to the side of the strip where Excalibur was. So, we would always be walking or spending money on monorail tickets when we should have just booked a room here in the first place. I didn't really enjoy their variety of slots though, so I'd usually walk to Luxor to gamble... Their food court isn't too shabby, but you can always count on their buffet, Roundtable Buffet to get your fill. We tried The Steakhouse and the food was great, but the atmosphere was a bit weird... it was your typical dimly lit steakhouse, but the music playing did not fit, it was like 80s new wave or something like that... The room upgrade was alright, it was a standard hotel room, on the 26th floor with a view of the colorful \\"castle\\". The only big difference was probably the colors of the room and the flat screen tv. The only thing we did with the tv was express check out... so it was pretty pointless. At some point, the tv didn't work, but we assumed it was the power strip it was plugged into.. One call to the front desk and when we got back to our room, it was fixed. Being that it was New Year's and we were in Vegas, we brought HELLA acohol with us so we needed ice to keep it cold, but the room didn't have a fridge or anything. So of course, we went straight to the ice machine. I don't know how ice machines work, but the one on our floor was malfunctioning and wasn't make enough ice. For example, I wanted to fill the bucket for my room, and it took forever to do... and there was guest behind me waiting for the machine as well. I don't think there was even any ice in the machine after I walked away. A friend of mine used his head and went up to the 28th floor where it seemed that there was no one occupying that floor. whenever we needed ice, we actually had to keep going up and down the elevator.

In other words, it means to deceive or mislead someone. This sentence is advising the listener not to provide false information to their parents or withhold the truth from them. Conveying an untruth may hurt trust in relationships, hence the advice against lying. 2. \\"The book lies on the table.\\" In this sentence, \\"lie\\" is also a verb but holds a completely different meaning. Here, the word \\"lie\\" refers to the position or placement of an object - in this case, the book. In this context, \\"lie\\" means that the book is resting in a flat position on the surface of the table.

Does the sentence \\"Since the smoking ban, some establishments operated a lock-in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but, unlike drinking lock-ins, allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What action by a pub owner can result in his prosecution?\\"","completion":"Yes, this sentence does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What action by a pub owner can result in his prosecution?\\" The key information from the sentence states that allowing smoking in a pub is a prosecutable offence. This means that if a pub owner permits patrons to smoke in their establishment, they may be subject to legal action and prosecution. To provide a more detailed explanation, the sentence indicates a situation where smoking has been banned in certain establishments, such as public places like pubs, bars, and restaurants. This is likely due to stricter laws and regulations put into place to protect public health and reduce the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. In response to this ban, some pub owners have resorted to operating a lock-in to allow their patrons to smoke without fear of repercussions. A lock-in refers to the practice of allowing patrons to stay inside a venue, such as a pub or bar, after it has officially closed for business. This can create a private, informal atmosphere where rules and regulations may not be as strictly enforced as they would be during regular operating hours. However, the sentence makes it clear that despite the more relaxed environment during a lock-in, allowing smoking inside a pub remains a prosecutable offence. This means that if a pub owner knowingly permits patrons to smoke in their establishment during a lock-in, they’re in breach of the law and can face legal consequences, including fines and even imprisonment. This stance aligns with the wider goal of smoking bans in public places, which is to reduce the health risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure and protect non-smokers. Smoking bans in public places also aim to minimize the possibility of fires and to ensure that all patrons can enjoy a safe and healthy environment.

Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving. - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training.

The Daily Has 1M Downloads - and 90k Subscribers? News Corp. hasn’t said a thing yet about how many people are paying to subscribe to The Daily, its four-month-old iPad-based news publication, but the circumstantial evidence suggests it’s doing better than at least the most hardened skeptics expected. Publisher Greg Clayman said at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference today that almost 1 million people have downloaded the app. That in itself doesn’t tell us anything about how many subscribers it has, since the app is free. (It’s the content that costs 99 cents a month or 39.99 a year.) But recall that The Daily was at 500,000 downloads, and 75,000 “regular users,” when the free trial period ended March 21. That means that consumers have downloaded the app at the same rate in past two months that they did in the first two months rather than shunning it now that it costs money to read. That’s a very good sign, as is the fact that The Daily has consistently been in the iTunes store’s list of the 10 top-grossing apps. Right now it’s No. 9, and the only news app that’s more popular is Wired, which just started selling subscriptions yesterday. I recently asked around in an effort to nail down the subscriptions number, and the figure I came up with was around 90,000, give or take a few thousand. The majority of those are automatically renewed weekly subscriptions, not annual ones. On its own, a total of 90,000 subscribers — I’m not sure how current this figure is, but it’s pretty logical given what else we know — is not going to make The Daily a success, but considering how fast people are buying iPads, if News Corp. can continue converting users at the same rate, it could be enough to be profitable within a couple years. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. News Corp.'s iPad-based news publication, The Daily, has not revealed its subscriber numbers, but it seems to be performing better than expected by some skeptics. 2. Publisher Greg Clayman stated that nearly 1 million people have downloaded the app, although this doesn't give specific subscriber numbers since the app itself is free, with the content costing 99 cents per month or 39.99 per year. 3.

The estimated subscriptions figure is around 90,000, with the majority of those being automatically renewed weekly subscriptions instead of yearly ones. 6.

Question 1: Why is white colour only showing once in the spectrum? Question 2: If I am half Iranian and half White American am I minority or am I white? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"I will answer the two questions separately and then analyze whether the answers are the same. Question 1: Step 1: Understand the nature of the color spectrum and how colors are produced. White light is composed of multiple colors of light combined together. A prism or other optical component can be used to separate white light into its constituent colors, creating a continuous color spectrum. Step 2: Explain why white appears once. In the spectrum, the individual colors blend into one another without any part of the spectrum being white. White is only formed when all of these colors recombine again. Since white is the combination of all colors and doesn't have a specific wavelength like other colors, it only appears once in the context of the question. Answer 1: White color only shows once in the spectrum because it is the result of the combination of all the colors in the spectrum, and it doesn't have a specific wavelength like the other individual colors. Question 2: Step 1: Understand the terms \\"minority\\" and \\"white.\\" In ethnic and racial terms, \\"minority\\" typically refers to a group that makes up a smaller percentage of a population when compared to another, often more dominant, group. \\"White\\" is a racial classification that typically refers to individuals of European descent, in the case of White American, it refers to individuals with a majority of European ancestry. Step 2: Analyze the user's ethnic background. The user describes themselves as half Iranian and half White American, which indicates a mixed ethnic background. Step 3: Determine whether the user would be considered a minority or white. Because the user has a mixed racial and ethnic background, they may be considered both a minority (due to their Iranian heritage) and white (due to their White American heritage). Answer 2: If you are half Iranian and half White American, you could be considered both a minority (because of your Iranian ancestry) and white (because of your White American ancestry). Comparing the answers: Answer 1 is concerned with the physical properties of light and color, while Answer 2 deals with racial and ethnic identity. While both answers discuss the concept of \\"white\\" in different contexts, the reasons and underlying principles for each answer are distinct. The answer to whether the two questions have the same answer is no, as the two questions concern different subjects, and their answers are based on distinct principles and contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who is Erasmus' cousin married to? ? The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception. As the ship sets off toward the African continent to collect its cargo, it becomes clear that Paris and the ship's captain, Saul Thurso, have very different world views.

Dress your cat in a bear costume: odd, but let the kitty dream. Push your overweight dog in a stroller: ridiculous, but sweet. Give your dog a tattoo covering its entire stomach and pierce its ears with mini barbells: WAIT! The New York Legislature believes some pet obsessions have gone too far. A bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals, the most common of which are cats and dogs, was unanimously passed in both chambers on Wednesday. The bill awaits signing by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. If Cuomo signs the bill, violators face possible fines or imprisonment. The legislation was initially introduced in 2011 when a groomer, Holly Crawford, of Sweet Valley, Pennsylvania, began marketing \\"Gothic kittens\\" on eBay. New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who represents Manhattan, introduced the legislation immediately after reading an article about the kittens, said Lauren Schuster, her chief of staff. The kittens were pierced down their entire back, according to Schuster. That practice was brought to the attention of law enforcement by the animal rights group PETA The groomer was prosecuted and convicted in Pennsylvania. Court documents showed she was sentenced to six months of electronic home monitoring and a period of probation. Crawford did not return a CNN call seeking comment. Under the New York bill, tattooing is acceptable as a form of identification for animals or to indicate that a medical procedure has been done, but \\"not for design purposes.\\" Animal advocates hope people will move to having pets \\"microchipped\\" instead. New York's bill gained momentum in early March, when a Brooklyn resident tattooed his pitbull while it was having surgery to have its spleen removed. This was the \\"catalyst for [the bill] to move again,\\" said Schuster. Response from the public and animal rights groups was immediate, said Schuster. \\"I think people have a natural knee jerk for something like this,\\" she said. People began to ask the question, \\"This really happens?\\" said Schuster. Under the bill, piercing and tattooing of companion animals would only be allowed for medical or identification purposes and must be performed by a licensed veterinarian. While tattooing in the past has been used as a form of identification, PETA says it prefers the microchip because it is the most effective. \\"Under no circumstance should an animal be pierced,\\" said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigation for PETA. Nachminovitch calls the bill a \\"wonderful thing\\" even though this \\"should be common sense,\\" she says. While many states have animal cruelty statues, this is the only ban she has heard of to legally ban the tattooing and piercing of companion animals. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The New York Legislature has unanimously passed a bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals, such as cats and dogs.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Booting. Yes or no?

Question: What is the first program to run during a system boot sequence? A:","completion":"Yes, the first program to run during a system boot sequence is typically stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashion. This initial program is commonly known as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or firmware, and its primary function is to initialize and test system hardware components, as well as load an operating system or bootloader from an appropriate storage device. In more detail, the system boot sequence can be broken down into several phases: 1. Power-On Self-Test (POST): When the computer is powered on, the initial instructions stored in boot ROMs (Read-Only Memory) or firmware (such as BIOS or UEFI) perform hardware checks and tests to ensure that the system's hardware components are functioning correctly. 2. Hardware discovery: The BIOS discovers all the hardware devices that are connected to the system, assigning system resources, and initializing device settings based on configuration data stored either in the storage devices or non-volatile memory. 3. Boot device selection: The BIOS determines which storage device to boot from based on user configuration. This can include hard drives, solid-state drives, optical drives, or even network-based storage solutions. 4. Bootloader execution: Once a valid boot device is selected, the BIOS loads the first sector from the chosen device (usually called the Master Boot Record or MBR) into memory and transfers control to the bootloader. The bootloader's primary function is to locate and load an operating system kernel into memory. 5. Kernel loading and initialization: The bootloader transfers control to the operating system kernel, which initializes various system components, such as device drivers, memory management, and other system services. Once the kernel has successfully loaded and initialized all necessary system components, it starts running user-space applications, and the boot process is considered complete. In summary, during the system boot sequence, the first program to run is the BIOS or firmware, whose purpose is to initialize and test hardware components and load the bootloader or operating system from an appropriate storage device."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Too much spirit, too little heart By Michael O'Sullivan Friday, Nov. 6, 2009 \\"Disney's A Christmas Carol\\" is a tall glass of Dickens with a \\"Beetlejuice\\" chaser. The umpteenth iteration of the holiday classic -- about the miserly, miserable Ebenezer Scrooge and his Christmas Eve redemption at the hands of a trio of ghosts -- gets a manic makeover under the direction of Robert Zemeckis, who applies the same motion-capture animation he used to mixed effect in \\"The Polar Express\\" to create a fable that is by turns antic, scary, sweet and, in the end, slightly soulless. In other words, it's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself. Mostly that's the fault of the animation, which renders everything and everyone in lavish (if somewhat cartoonish) detail, yet misses that ineffable quality that makes a cartoon character human. It's populated by figures that are halfway between Wii Fit avatars and real people. This, despite the Herculean efforts of the voice cast, which includes Jim Carrey as Scrooge and the ghosts that visit him, and Gary Oldman as Scrooge's dead partner Jacob Marley, Scrooge's clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit's son Tiny Tim. That the film takes advantage of the latest 3-D technology isn't entirely a bad thing either. The supernatural tale lends itself nicely to the eye-popping special effects, in which Scrooge zooms all over England -- and jumps the bounds of the space-time continuum -- visiting not only his own happy past and wretched future, but corners of the present day about which he has no clue. In fact, the film is at its best when Scrooge, guided by a jolly, red-bearded Ghost of Christmas Present, makes the floor of Scrooge's house disappear. The two of them then fly hither and yon, peering down into the impoverished dining room of the Cratchit family, for instance, where the stoic Tiny Tim feels the trickle-down effects of his father's meager wages (not to mention Victorian-era health care). Just as Scrooge gets a taste of how the other half lives, you'll feel like you're in some high-tech glass-bottomed boat. And you will get verklempt when Tim raises his cup to say \\"God bless us . . . every one.\\" Not so great is the sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Traditionally, he's the most starkly terrifying of the ghosts, and that's no exception here. Decked out like the Grim Reaper, he'll scare the pants off most younger kids, even as a protracted chase sequence -- in which a hearse pulled by red-eyed hell horses pursues an inexplicably Barbie-doll-size Scrooge through the streets and plumbing of London -- will bore parents to tears. Just because something can be done with computers doesn't mean it should be. Make no mistake. Dickens's story has good bones. And its lesson -- that it's never too late to make a difference in someone else's life -- more than carries the day. Despite the Disney imprimatur, though, parents should think twice about whether to take the very youngest, or the most impressionable, to this version of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" which is far and away the creepiest I've ever seen. When Scrooge is visited by the specter of his late partner Marley, the ghost's jaw becomes hideously dislocated and his face splits open. Older kids will laugh. My 10-year-old couldn't get to sleep. Weirder still is the irony that this story -- which is all about the importance of the simple things in life, and giving, not getting -- is so overwhelmed by what are essentially video-game features. In fact, look for it in stores now, on the Nintendo DS system. At area theaters. Contains creepiness. ||||| Movie Review Disney's A Christmas Carol in Disney Digital 3D Blah, humbug! 'A Christmas Carol's 3-D spin on Dickens well done in parts but lacks spirit Jim Carrey plays Ebenezzer Scrooge as well as 2 of 3 ghosts in Disney's 3-D 'A Christmas Carol.' 3-D animated version of the holiday story. With Jim Carrey . Director: Robert Zemeckis (1:36). PG: Ghostly scares. At area theaters. If you're going to make another version of the iconic, 166-year-old \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" there needs to be a hook. Unfortunately, the latest version of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, from Disney and director Robert Zemeckis, has a weak one: the casting of Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge as well as two of the three ghosts. While Carrey's animated performance as the old miser is serviceable, he wasn't born to play him, and to be frank, audiences weren't exactly clamoring for it. (His growly Grinch was quite enough.) And while Dickens' message isn't lost, this retelling never soars. That's ironic, since the vivid 3-D ­motion-capture technology that's created Scrooge and company — the format Zemeckis used for 2004's \\"Polar Express\\" — allows for flights above Victorian-era London. Those are big set-pieces that somehow never exhilarate. And \\"mo-cap\\" comes at a cost: Like a dime-store holiday card, this \\"Christmas Carol\\" is well-crafted but artless, detailed but lacking soul. The plot — if it needs recapping — is simplicity itself: Scrooge, who hates Christmas a lot and people even more, is in need of an otherworldly intervention. On Dec. 24, the ghost of his business partner Jacob Marley warns he'll be visited by the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Yet to Come. The specters arrive on cue and show Scrooge his youth and future, as well as the fate of Tiny Tim, the crippled child of his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman). As the lead character, Carrey's CG-­created body is spindly and bent, and he has fun with his vocal performance, turning every word into a strangled hiss. He's less successful as Christmas Past — a candle with an irritatingly moony face — and as the burly, bearded Christmas Present, who here looks like the bloated late-era Jim Morrison. The motion-capture does no favors to co-stars Oldman, ­Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn, since, as in \\"Polar Express,\\" the animated eyes never seem to ­focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it's off-putting. To his credit, Zemeckis — who should get in touch with his inner adult for a change, the one who made \\"Cast Away\\" — doesn't entirely dumb down the material: Yes, there's a chase featuring a needlessly miniaturized Scrooge. On the whole, though, he manages to rein Carrey in. When Zemeckis turns the most haunting scene — Scrooge's sighting of the ragged children called Ignorance and Want — into a Tim Burton-esque moment, the effect is startling but tonally consistent. Scares like that may disturb kids under 7, and that's typical of this, Hollywood's first big-screen \\"Christmas Carol\\" of the millennium. It's neither gravy nor grave, as Scrooge might say; creepy, but with a family-friendly star at the center. Though not a humbug, it likely won't be remembered in six years, let alone 166. jneumaier@nydailynews.com ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Disney's A Christmas Carol, directed by Robert Zemeckis, uses motion-capture animation and 3-D technology, but falls short in capturing the heart and soul of Charles Dickens' story.

A major positive of this app is its versatility, as it allows users to access a range of Linux applications and scripts on their Android devices. It is evident that the developers have worked on creating a more accessible way for Android users to gain access to powerful Linux terminal environments. The app's interface is clear and easy to navigate, which helps users understand the Linux terminal without any significant issues. Additionally, having an in-built package manager is a great addition, making it easy to install various packages and enhance terminal functionality. However, there are some areas where I feel the app could be improved. One of the most significant drawbacks for me was the lack of proper documentation. The user manual and help files can be quite challenging to navigate, making it difficult for new users to understand all the nuances of the application. This can lead to frustration as users struggle to make full use of the app's offerings. Furthermore, I've noticed that some popular packages are missing from the app's repository. Although I understand that the app aims to provide a lightweight environment, it still makes it challenging for users who want to have a more comprehensive Linux experience on their Android device. Lastly, while the performance of the app is generally good, I've noticed some instances of lags and app crashes, particularly when running more resource-intensive packages or scripts. It'd be great to see the developers work on optimizing the app to provide a more seamless and stable experience for users. In conclusion, I award the com.termux app 3 stars for its satisfactory performance as an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment. While it has great potential, I believe that addressing the issues I mentioned above can improve this app significantly. By incorporating better documentation, expanding the repository with more popular packages, and optimizing the performance of the app, com.termux could become the go-to choice for Android users looking to access a Linux terminal environment on their devices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence in Turkish mentions that initially, the concerned party chose to approach the European Union (AB, Avrupa Birliği in Turkish) to seek arbitration regarding the fairness and reasonableness of a particular agreement. Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution, in which the parties allow an impartial third party to make a decision about a dispute or issue. In this case, the European Union is being requested by the party to act as the arbitrator and assess the contract or agreement's fairness and reasonableness. This choice could stem from a variety of reasons. For instance, approaching the European Union as the arbitration authority potentially reflects the entity's trust in the organization's capabilities and reputation in dealing with such matters. Additionally, it might signify that the agreement under review has transnational implications, and therefore requires the input of a powerful supranational organization to make an informed decision. It is not clear from the sentence which specific agreement is being referenced, or the parties involved, which would provide more context and understanding of why the European Union is being called upon to arbitrate. However, it can be inferred that the agreement in question seems to have some significance, given that it requires arbitration by the European Union – a prominent actor with legal and economic influence over its member states and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"Title: Wrath of the Gods Plot Summary: The Wrath of the Gods follows the epic story of Perseus, a young demigod in ancient Greece, as he navigates the precarious balance between his human and divine heritage. Perseus, overwhelmed by his new-found powers and destiny, must step up and assume his role as the hero in a climactic battle that could change history and solidify the godly reign of his father, Zeus. Act I: In the idyllic kingdom of Argos, ruled by the fair King Acrisius and Queen Danaë, their daughter Princess Andromeda is plagued by horrible nightmares. These nightmares tell of a prophecy that a demigod will be born with the power to overthrow the King, leading to the kingdom's eventual doom. Deeply troubled by this revelation, King Acrisius sends a plea to the gods for help. Meanwhile, the young and seemingly ordinary shepherd named Perseus (our protagonist) lives a peaceful life, unaware of his true royal lineage and his divine father, Zeus. He is passionate about stories of gods and myths, but he also has an unusual ability to communicate with animals, a power that remains a secret between him and his adoptive parents. Act II: Zeus, unable to ignore the King's plea, sends the divine messenger Iris to inform Perseus of his true origin. Perseus initially refuses to believe that he is Zeus' son, but upon a demonstration of his power, he finally accepts the truth. However, embracing his destiny proves difficult, as he struggles to control his burgeoning abilities under Iris' guidance. As Perseus trains, a sudden drought and a series of unexplained disasters devastate Argos, causing its people to suffer. King Acrisius, convinced that the gods have abandoned them, rallies his people to wage war against the gods in retaliation. They build an enormous army and colossal machines of war to assault Mount Olympus. Unbeknownst to them, Queen Danaë has a secret: Perseus is her and Zeus' long-lost son, hidden away to protect him from his father's jealous wife, Hera. Act III: Perseus, now in control of his powers and entrusted with a magical weapon called \\"The Harvester\\" (a golden sword imbued with Zeus's power) by Iris, learns of the prophecy and the impending war between Argos and the gods. Conflicted by his human and divine heritages, he ultimately decides to fight for both sides in an effort to establish peace and save the kingdom. As the war wages on, Princess Andromeda discovers her father's plot to destroy the gods and joins forces with Perseus to stop the prophecy from coming true. Together, they unravel a plot orchestrated by Hera to bring strife to Zeus' reign and ultimately discredit him as the leader of the gods. In the thrilling climax, Perseus uses his powers and divine weapon to defeat the dark, vengeful gods secretly aiding King Acrisius and his human army. In a final face-off against Hera, Perseus discovers the true meaning of sacrifice and heroism, setting aside his desire for revenge and saving both the gods and humanity. Epilogue: In the aftermath, Zeus acknowledges Perseus as his son and bestows upon him the title \\"Protector of the Realms.\\" Perseus and Andromeda unite the kingdoms of Argos and Olympus as they marry, forging a renewed era of peace and prosperity between mankind and the divine. Perseus, now a renowned hero, embraces the responsibilities that come with his legacy and promises to protect those who cannot protect themselves. The film 'Wrath of the Gods,' with its blend of adventure, romance, and mythology, explores themes of vengeance, forgiveness, and sacrifice, taking the audience on a breathtaking journey through the life of a demigod who defies all odds to unite humans and gods."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The New York Times “A friend once told me that New York is a bunch of small villages, really,” said Ms. Adams, who today is co-editor of Murray Hill Life, a newsletter and frequents local favorites like Barbès, a Moroccan restaurant on 36th Street. “I find that Murray Hill certainly is one of those villages.” The neighborhood skews younger now than it did 10 years ago, and it is growing up physically, too. Far from immune to the building boom of the last few years, Murray Hill continues to sprout new towers that mix in with the old, from the spires along the East River to wide new luxury apartment houses on 34th Street, and even an understated high-rise at 45 Park Avenue designed by Costas Kondylis. Others are still under construction, or stopped midrise, a source of angst for some residents. Aside from the bar scene on Third Avenue, some locals have groused lately about East Side Access, a long-term construction project that will route Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal. Until recently, said Toni Carlina, the district manager of Community Board 6, workers were jackhammering on Park Avenue with floodlights until the early morning hours, though after many board meetings, the noise now ends earlier. It is commonly held that the younger, more bar-centric area south of the neighborhood in the upper 20s and lower 30s is part of Murray Hill; after all, the Murray Hill Diner sits at 33rd and Lexington, and a bar called the Hill, reportedly backed by reality TV stars, packs them in at Third and 29th. But longtime locals (and their community board) will tell you that Murray Hill begins at 34th Street and extends to 42nd Street; its other boundaries are Madison Avenue and the East River. Above all, contrasts make the area distinctive: Town houses abut white-brick buildings, which abut office and apartment towers. The common theme is that there is no common theme. Of the town houses remaining in what was once a bastion of 19th-century high society, several are stunners; a small historic district was created in 2002 and then enlarged to protect them. A few Gilded Age palaces remain, too, like the building that is now the Polish Consulate, on Madison Avenue at 37th Street, and an 1891 McKim, Mead & White house at Park Avenue and 35th Street, now a co-op for a few lucky residents. Just off 36th Street is another small wonder, at Sniffen Court, an alley of 10 Civil War-era carriage houses. “There are nice little pockets of quiet everywhere,” Ms. Adams said. But that is not exactly how you would describe the scene a few blocks away, along First Avenue, with its imposing row of East River high-rise buildings, among them the intimidating Corinthian on 38th Street, which has 57 floors. Farther up the avenue, massive gravel-filled lots sit vacant, once home to hulking Con Edison buildings and the planned site of a 4 billion 3,000-unit apartment and commercial complex from the developer Sheldon H. Solow. There is no evidence of any work being done; Citibank, Mr. Solow’s lender, was reported to have filed suit against him in December. Second Avenue in Murray Hill is notable for delis and take-out joints; Third Avenue for shops, restaurants and, yes, bars. Lexington and Park keep to a more residential feel, and Madison has an office vibe. Though Murray Hill in theory extends to 42nd Street, 39th seems a more clear-cut line of demarcation with Midtown and its office towers. Along with the rest of the city, the sales market in Murray Hill began to fade last October, and prices have shifted accordingly. “I would estimate that many sellers who have had proper guidance from their brokers are asking 20 percent below what they would have asked in January,” said Julie Perlin, a broker at Stribling & Associates. At the Vanderbilt, an East 40th Street high-rise, Sachiko Goodman, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, originally listed a three-bedroom condominium with 1,562 square feet for nearly 2 million. After six months on the market, it sold earlier this year for 1.5 million. “Today, somebody really has to be the lowest one on the market if they want to sell,” said Elaine Clayman, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens. In general, Ms. Clayman explained, one-bedroom condos begin in the high 500,000s, two-bedrooms under 1 million; co-ops are generally 100,000 less. Last month, Ms. Perlin of Stribling sold a one-bedroom two-bath 38th-floor condo on East 38th for 800,000. Brownstones, Ms. Perlin said, range from the high 2 millions through the low 3 millions, with a premium for buildings in the historic district. Rentals are still moving, though these days it’s a tenants’ market, Ms. Goodman said; owners have resorted to covering broker fees, offering free months, and lowering rents. One-bedrooms now rent for 2,500 to 3,500 a month, and two-bedrooms go for 3,500 to 5,000, depending on view and amenities. On May 17, the neighborhood association will have its annual Murray Hill Festival on Park Avenue, with music performances, arts and crafts activities and plenty of on-street shopping. On Sundays, the local PTA sponsors the Murray Hill Market at Public School 116 on 33rd Street, with goods for sale both outside and in. Over on Madison Avenue at 36th Street, J. Pierpont Morgan’s library is Murray Hill’s whirring cultural space, offering art exhibits, programs for kids, concerts, film screenings, lectures and library tours. For fans of mainstream cinema, the AMC Loews Kips Bay multiplex is just south of the area, on Second Avenue at 31st Street. Residents sing the praises of P.S. 116, on East 33rd Street. In 2008, 94.8 percent of all students met standards on state English language arts tests and 94.5 did so in mathematics; the citywide percentages were 61 and 80. One middle school near Murray Hill is Junior High School 104 on East 21st Street, also known as Simon Baruch, where 77.2 percent of all students met standards on 2008 state math tests, and 70.4 percent on English tests. The citywide percentages were 60 and 43. At Norman Thomas High School, also on 33rd, 2008 SAT averages were 365 in reading, 367 in math and 358 in writing, versus 502, 515 and 494 statewide. Technically, one could step over the border of Murray Hill and be in Midtown, specifically the 42nd Street border. For those heading to the financial district or points farther afield, the No. 6 train stops at Grand Central Terminal, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue. The Murrays of Murray Hill were Mary and Robert, Pennsylvania Quakers who bought land between 33rd and 39th Streets in the 18th century; the area was known at that time as Inclenberg. It was in the 19th century that fashionable society arrived, among them the Astors and the Morgans, and their mansions.

She did say Governor Palin at least one time . Answer the following question: Why did she say Governor Palin ?","completion":"In order to answer this question, it is essential to understand the context behind the interview you mentioned, which was a 2008 interview between then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and CBS News anchor Katie Couric. Palin, as a vice-presidential candidate on the Republican ticket with Senator John McCain, was subjected to a series of interviews that would help build her public image and inform the American electorate of her qualifications, views, and experience. Katie Couric, as a respected journalist and television personality, conducted this particular interview in a professional manner, aiming to maintain objectivity and provide a platform for Palin to articulate her ideas, experiences, and political positions. To that end, it would be expected for Couric to address her interviewee with the appropriate title, and for Palin, as the sitting Governor of Alaska, that title would be \\"Governor Palin.\\" There could be multiple reasons as to why Katie Couric addressed Sarah Palin as \\"Governor Palin\\": 1. Respect for her official title: As mentioned earlier, addressing her as \\"Governor Palin\\" is a sign of respect for her official post and position in the government. As a journalist, it is essential to maintain professional decorum and show respect to your interviewee, regardless of personal opinions or biases. 2. Reinforcing her status and experience: By addressing her as \\"Governor Palin,\\" Couric was highlighting Palin's experience and status as an elected official. This would serve a dual purpose - it would remind the audience of Palin's qualifications for the vice-president position and also convey the fact that Couric, as an impartial journalist, was giving Palin the opportunity to present her case in a fair manner. 3. Maintaining objectivity: Using Governor Palin's appropriate title helped Couric establish and maintain objectivity in the interview. By consistently addressing her by her professional title, Couric ensured that her questions and the overall structure of the interview remained neutral and unbiased. With regards to the criticisms of the media's treatment of Palin and Couric's interview, it is worth noting that the role of the media, and specifically journalists, is to scrutinize public figures and ensure that they are held accountable for their actions, statements, and qualifications. Couric's interview, by addressing Palin with her appropriate title and asking questions about her foreign policy experience, among other topics, was in line with this responsibility. In conclusion, Katie Couric addressed Sarah Palin as \\"Governor Palin\\" during the interview in order to show respect for her official title, reinforce her status and experience, and maintain objectivity throughout the interview. It is a common practice for journalists to address public figures by their proper titles as a sign of professional decorum, and Couric's interview with Palin was no exception. The criticisms against the media's treatment of Palin and this interview should also be viewed through the lens of journalistic responsibility and the media's role in scrutinizing public figures."},{"prompt":"Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about an American alpine ski racer, Bode Miller, who achieved a notable victory in a Men's World Cup super-G (Super Giant Slalom) event. Miller's impressive performance led him to win his second race in consecutive days and marked his third win in the three starts he participated in that particular season. In the context of alpine skiing, the super-G is a speed event that combines elements of downhill and giant slalom skiing. It requires skiers to be both fast and agile, navigating through a challenging array of gates at high speeds while maintaining precision and control. The text highlights Bode Miller's outstanding performance, as winning consecutively and maintaining a winning streak demonstrates his exceptional skill and prowess in the sport.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu... Question: What does the Centers for Disease Control probably believe. === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","completion":"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) likely believes that seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, as it affects millions of Americans, results in hospitalizations, and even causes deaths every year. The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot to minimize the risk of illness and the potential spreading of the virus, especially to vulnerable populations like older adults who face a higher risk of getting dangerously ill from the flu. The CDC also monitors the flu situation each year to provide updates and resources for the public, ensuring that appropriate information is available for people to make informed decisions about vaccination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart.

After speculation of where the game would be played due to the California wildfires, it was confirmed on October 26, 2007 that Qualcomm Stadium would be discontinued as an evacuation site for San Diego residents (with most of the evacuees moved to Del Mar). Before, sites in the Phoenix area were being considered to host the game, as well as Houston's Reliant Stadium, and also the Dallas Cowboys' Texas Stadium. Before the game a special tribute was paid to at the stadium for the fire fighters, National Guard, and volunteers who assisted in fighting the fires and helping the evacuees. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended the game and flipped the coin, which the Chargers won. With an emotional charge from both the players and fans, as well as some victims, the Chargers played one of the best games of their season. Philip Rivers threw 3 touchdown passes despite only throwing 11 passes. Two TDs went to tight end Antonio Gates, and the remainder went to newly acquired wideout Chris Chambers, who was just traded from the Miami Dolphins a two weeks earlier and played his first game as a Charger (due to San Diego's bye week). However, that performance was second to second-year corner Antonio Cromartie, who performance included two interceptions, and two defensive touchdowns. He had a 70-yard INT return for a score, and the other was a complicated snap where the Texans snapped the ball over punter Matt Turk's head, and the ball fell into the end zone. Quickly having to recover, Turk missed grabbing the ball and it fell into the hands of Cromartie, easily scoring.

Q:I read this background article the other day: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. I am facing a new situation today: Two friends had different diseases. Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend received fewer antiretroviral drugs? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the situation with your two friends, Nigel and Manny, the answer to the question is that Manny received fewer antiretroviral drugs. Nigel was infected with the HIV virus, which is a viral disease, and as mentioned in the article, antiretroviral drugs (ART) have been developed rapidly over the past twenty years, primarily to treat HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Nigel would be receiving antiretroviral drugs as part of his treatment plan to manage the HIV infection. On the other hand, Manny contracted a bacterial infection. Antiretroviral drugs are not used to treat bacterial infections, as they are specifically designed for treating viral infections. Instead, bacterial infections are treated using antibiotics, which are a different class of medication. Thus, Manny would not be receiving antiretroviral drugs for his bacterial infection. In summary, Manny received fewer antiretroviral drugs because he had a bacterial infection, which is not treated with this type of medication. Nigel, who was infected with the HIV virus, would more likely be receiving antiretroviral drugs as they are designed to treat viral infections like HIV."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Print mediums include magazine, newspaper, coupon book and trade/industry journal advertisements. Consider your target audience when you are deciding on a publication to run your ad in. For example, if you own a women's clothing store, you would want to buy advertising space in fashion magazines, while someone who owns a mechanic shop would choose to advertise in an auto club magazine. Also called direct mail advertising, this method involves sending printed marketing materials like postcards and brochures directly to recipients' mail boxes. For a direct mail campaign, businesses purchase mailing lists that target their market sector. Direct mail comes with the costs of printing, mailing and purchasing mailing lists, and is therefore less cost effective and not as widely used as Internet marketing. However, direct mail marketing is ideal for things like hand-signed messages and paper coupons. For example, a home security system business would only mail to homeowners, rather than renters. The first thing you should do is create a website for your business so that customers can browse your wares and services online. Having a website also helps when promoting your business through social media. Create pages for your business on major social media platforms like Facebook, Yelp, and Instagram. Other online tools you can use include: Search engine optimization (SEO), banner ads, pay per click ads, mass emails, forums, directory listings, blogs, and affiliate programs. While it may seem old school, flyers are an excellent way to get the word out about your business. Either hang flyers up or distribute them by hand. Pass out flyers in public places where a lot of people gather, such as malls, trade shows, retailers, busy sidewalks and industry seminars. Additionally, you may acquire new customers by putting flyers on cars in parking lots, or handing flyers outdoor to door at apartment complexes and in neighborhoods. Another marketing possibility is creating a commercial that can be broadcasted on TV or the radio. Of course, it is important to keep your budget in mind. If you are going to do a commercial, you will want it to look professional rather than corny. To make a convincing commercial, you will need to spend a bit of money. Because of this, TV and radio ads are best suited for large, far-reaching companies that have the budget for such an expense. If you do want to go through with a commercial, search freelance-oriented websites like Thumbtack for freelance video producers who will generally shoot your commercial for less than large production companies. If you've ever glanced at a billboard and been intrigued by the business advertised there, then you know that signage does actually work. Billboard ads, marquee boards and storefront signs may attract customers to your business. If you have a mascot or logo for your store, you could also consider hiring someone to dance around in your mascot's costume and a sign in front of your store to attract customer attention. If you have tried increasing customer traffic by yourself and think you might need some professional help, look into hiring a public relations firm. PR firms handle press releases and news stories that can generate interest in your business. PR specialists can also help you come up with more convincing ad campaigns.

Goal: Make slow cooked pulled pork. Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPT: I.

Put pork in the slow cooker with your choice of BBQ sauce for 3 hours on high heat to cook as quickly as possible. Then shred with a fork....I think the answer is","completion":"I. Put one pound pork shoulder in slow cooker with your choice of barbeque sauce for 6 hours on low heat. Then shred with a fork. In order to achieve a tender and flavorful slow-cooked pulled pork, it is more reasonable to opt for Option I, which consists of cooking the pork shoulder in the slow cooker for a longer duration on low heat. This method allows for the gradual breaking down of collagen and connective tissues in the pork shoulder, resulting in a moist and succulent texture that can be easily shredded with a fork. In comparison, Option II involves cooking the pork for a shorter time on high heat. Although this method enables the pork to cook quickly, it is less likely to yield the desired tenderness and flavor profile. When cooked on high heat, the meat tends to lose more moisture, leading to a drier and tougher final product. Preparing slow-cooked pulled pork requires a certain level of patience and time commitment, but the end result is well worth the extra effort. By cooking the pork shoulder on low heat for an extended period, you can achieve a perfectly tender and flavorsome dish that is rich in taste and texture. To prepare slow-cooked pulled pork using Option I, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose a quality pork shoulder or pork butt weighing around 1 pound. Trim off any excess fat. 2. Season the pork shoulder generously with salt and pepper, or your choice of spice rub. You may also marinate the pork for a few hours or overnight to enrich the flavors. 3. Choose your preferred barbecue sauce, homemade or store-bought, depending on your taste preferences and the amount of time you have for cooking. 4. Place the seasoned pork shoulder in the slow cooker, and pour the barbecue sauce over the pork until it's well coated. 5. Set your slow cooker to low heat and cook the pork for 6 hours. Make sure to avoid opening the lid frequently, as this can release heat and prolong the cooking process. 6. After 6 hours, carefully remove the pork from the slow cooker and transfer it to a cutting board. Using two forks, shred the pork into small pieces, discarding any excess fat or connective tissues. 7. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and mix it with the remaining sauce. If needed, add more barbecue sauce to achieve your desired consistency. Continue to cook the pulled pork on low heat for another 30 minutes to an hour, allowing the flavors to meld. 8. Serve the slow-cooked pulled pork on sandwiches, tacos, or as a main dish alongside your favorite sides. By following Option I, you can ensure your slow-cooked pulled pork will be tender, moist, and packed with flavor, creating a delicious and satisfying meal for your friends and family to enjoy."},{"prompt":"Question: Where does Raimunda hide the body of Paco?

Title: The Untouchables Movie plot: During Prohibition in 1930, Al Capone has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies illegal liquor. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness is assigned to stop Capone, but his first attempt at a liquor raid fails due to corrupt policemen tipping Capone off. He has a chance meeting with Irish-American veteran officer Jimmy Malone, who is fed up with the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting that they find a man from the police academy who has not come under Capone's influence. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (aka-Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and intelligence. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they conduct a successful raid on a Capone liquor cache and start to gain positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \\"The Untouchables.\\" Capone later kills the henchman in charge of the cache as a warning to his other men. Wallace discovers that Capone has not filed an income tax return for some years and suggests that the team try to build a tax evasion case against him, since he is well-insulated from his other crimes. An alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness angrily refuses it and throws him out of the office. When Capone gunman Frank Nitti threatens Ness' family, Ness has his wife and daughter moved to a safe house. His team flies to the CanadaâUnited States border to intercept an incoming liquor shipment, aided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, killing several gangsters and capturing George, a Capone bookkeeper. Malone shoots a gangster through the mouth (not revealing the man is already dead) to scare George into agreeing to testify against Capone. Wallace prepares to escort George from the Chicago police station to a safe house, but they are shot and killed by Nitti, who has infiltrated the station. Ness confronts Capone and his men over the deaths, but Malone intervenes to save him from being killed and urges him to persuade the district attorney not to dismiss...

A top breeder whose show dogs savaged three young girls was given a suspended jail sentence today. The girls, aged five to seven, were attacked by two bull mastiffs as they walked home from school with their mothers. They were ‘shaken like dolls’ and bitten all over their bodies, a court heard. All needed hospital treatment for their wounds and two required surgery. Owner Julie Lindley, 53, admitted the dogs, which had escaped from her garden, were dangerously out of control. She destroyed both dogs after the attack, Manchester Minshull Street Court heard. One, a two-year-old called Theo, had just been named a top UK bull mastiff and had come third at Crufts. Theo attacked the girls in Bolton after escaping from his pen with another dog on March 22 last year. Caroline Hamer told the court how the dogs bounded towards them as she walked home with her daughter, Nicola, seven, and her five-year-old friends Matilda Dawning and Charlotte Riggs. Alison Hayworth, prosecuting said: ‘The dogs pushed them all to the ground and Mrs Hamer quickly got up, however Nicola was still on the pavement with both dogs attacking her, biting her and shaking her like a doll. ‘Mrs Hamer got the dog off and tried to wedge herself between it and her daughter. A passer-by put the girl, who was covered in blood, in a car.’ The dogs then lunged at Matilda. Her. mother tried to lift her out of the way but one bit the girl’s leg and. it became ‘a tug of war’ as both mother and child were pulled into the. road. Julie with Theo who was named a top UK bull mastiff. Lucy Riggs, the mother of Charlotte, watched in horror as the dogs grabbed her daughter’s arm and pierced her forearm. Motorist Darren Westhead desperately tried to stop the attack by driving into one dog. But it got up again and began snapping once more. When police found the dogs, Theo had blood in his mouth. The three mothers told the court their daughters had been ‘terrified’ and would bear the physical and psychological scars for years, if not for life. Lindley, from Bolton, who runs breeding company Hyerdunscar Bullmastiffs, admitted being the owner of two dogs dangerously out of control. Since the incident, two cages have been put into the garden and the fence has been strengthened, the court heard. Judge Martin Allweis said he accepted that Lindley was full of remorse but the attack had been ‘serious and sustained’ against three children. He sentenced her to three months in jail, suspended for 12 months, and ordered her to pay £1,000 costs. She now faces a civil claim for compensation.

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. In 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: John was testing a radio wave and had an interesting finding. The shorter the wavelength was, the frequency became Higher or Lower? Paragraph : Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. The answer is:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the answer to the question is that when John was testing a radio wave and found that the shorter the wavelength was, the frequency became higher. The paragraph clearly states that \\"longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies.\\" This means that as the wavelength decreases (becomes shorter), the frequency increases (becomes higher). Conversely, when the wavelength increases (becomes longer), the frequency decreases (becomes lower). To further understand this concept, it is essential to know the relationship between wavelength and frequency. The wavelength and frequency of an electromagnetic wave are inversely proportional to each other, as expressed by the formula: speed of light (c) = wavelength (λ) × frequency (ν). The speed of light is a constant, approximately 3.0 × 10^8 meters per second (m/s). In John's experiment, he observed that when the wavelength of the radio wave became shorter, the frequency became higher. This observation is consistent with the information provided in the paragraph and is a fundamental concept in the study of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves. In conclusion, John's interesting finding in his radio wave experiment can be explained by the inverse relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic waves. When the wavelength of a radio wave becomes shorter, its frequency becomes higher, as supported by the information in the paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

TV stars, travel bloggers not immune to fear of flying Reality TV star Kendra Wilkinson hates to fly, and her fear is not uncommon. (CNN) -- She's a veteran reality television star, not to mention an author, entrepreneur, wife and mother. Kendra Wilkinson's life in the limelight demands that she travel by plane about five times a month. She can handle fame, but flying terrifies her. \\"I cannot stand it,\\" she says. When she flies, Wilkinson, whose reality show, \\"Kendra on Top,\\" debuted this month on WE tv, turns to her fellow passengers to help her cope. \\"Every time I fly, I grab on to the person next to me,\\" she says. \\"People pray with me.\\" The airline staff members she encounters are especially empathetic. \\"The flight attendants give me ice packs.\\" Millions share Wilkinson's anxiety, and the fear can be debilitating. Many turn to professional therapy. Others try to resolve their fears themselves; some have more success than others. Experts caution that it's hard to pin down a precise number of people who suffer from a fear of flying, without a recent comprehensive survey. Also, many are reluctant to share details of their phobia -- or how disruptive it can be. Wilkinson, who rose to fame as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends on the reality show \\"The Girls Next Door,\\" turns to the cocktail cart to calm her nerves. \\"I do try to have a glass of wine. Wine helps me cool down a little bit,\\" she says. \\"Or two glasses of wine.\\" Pinot grigio aside, she also tries to picture calming images. \\"I try my hardest to close my eyes and picture my son,\\" she says. \\"I think of my happiest moments.\\" Wilkinson, who hasn't received formal treatment, aspires to fly with her 2½-year-old son without scaring him with her unconcealed fear. John DiScala conquered his fear of flying and now runs a popular travel website. Reason doesn't always conquer fear John DiScala was terrified to fly. From his late teens until his early 20s, he rarely left his home in Connecticut. Now, he visits more than 20 countries a year -- by plane -- and runs the travel blog JohnnyJet.com. But his runway toward recovery was a long one. His terror set in when he was 17. Waiting with his parents to board a flight from New York, bound for Australia, he had an anxiety attack at the airport. \\"I felt this tingling all over my body,\\" he says. \\"I felt like I was not in control.\\" The year before, his doctor had diagnosed him with asthma. He had also suggested that the cabin pressure on the flight could give him respiratory problems. \\"It kept running through my head what the doctor said,\\" DiScala remembers: \\" 'You will have trouble breathing.' \\" He missed that trip to Perth, where he would have visited his sisters -- and didn't travel again for more than three years. \\"I was basically afraid to leave the house,\\" he says. \\"I was full of fear.\\" This unchecked terror arises despite statistics that show how safe flying is. Less than 1% of total transportation fatalities in the U.S. were the result of air accidents in the most recent figures from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. But numbers don't necessarily calm nerves. And a fear of air travel isn't always rational. \\"It doesn't have to do with how safe flying is,\\" says Tom Bunn, the president and founder of the SOAR program. He counsels fearful fliers with a mix of one-on-one therapy and education about how airplanes work. He says his clients, who hail from a wide range of backgrounds and professions, try to talk themselves out of their fear but fail. \\"Oftentimes, they struggle tremendously on their own to fix it, and find they can't,\\" he says. Many turn to therapy when their fear starts to disrupt their lives as well as their livelihoods. Patty McLoughlin, 53, is a sales representative in the gift industry. She needs to travel to meetings at least twice a year. Based in Columbus, Ohio, she would regularly drive 12 hours just to avoid a flight. She hadn't flown in 16 years. \\"For pleasure, I could work around it,\\" she says. \\"Not with business.\\" But when a West Coast meeting came up at a new job, she realized she had to conquer her fear. \\"It was difficult to drive to California,\\" she says. It was impractical as well. She realized that her fear was getting in the way, and flying to meetings would help her make the most of her new job. \\"If I wanted to grow within the company, I knew I'd have to overcome it,\\" she says. And she did, with the help of a SOAR course. There are people who buy plane tickets but are too scared to use them. \\"We hear from people who want to go someplace special, and they can't go,\\" says Alies Muskin, executive director of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. \\"They just don't do it.\\" Karina Slota of Maryland, 39, was supposed to be maid of honor at her sister's wedding in Bermuda 10 years ago. Her entire family traveled to the event, including her 80-year-old grandmother, who had flown over from Germany. Slota boarded the flight from Maryland to Bermuda but didn't make it to takeoff. \\"If I stay on this plane, I am going to die,\\" she thought. While the plane was still at the gate, flight attendants had to open the plane door to let Slota off. She calls the experience humiliating. \\"I was crying,\\" she says. \\"I felt like I was being judged.\\" She missed the wedding, and for 10 years, she didn't fly. Finally, Slota took a course with SOAR. Although she still gets anxious ahead of a trip, she says she manages to stay calm on the flight itself. She uses the mental exercises she learned from the program's videos, such as focusing on her surroundings, to stay calm and now flies about once a year. Some travelers are afraid to travel by plane without letting that fear interfere with their lives. They might grip their armrests tightly during takeoff, say a prayer before they board or take anti-anxiety medication. And when a flight gets bumpy, almost anyone can get scared, even frequent fliers. \\"I really don't like turbulence,\\" says Liz Borod Wright, editor of the travel blog Travelogged. But she doesn't let that stop her from traveling overseas. Driving isn't a realistic option when holiday plans include Europe. \\"I'm not going to let my fear of flying prevent me from flying.\\" Fear of flying \\"doesn't discriminate,\\" says Josh Spitalnick, director of Research and Clinical Services at the Virtually Better clinic in Atlanta. He says some of his clinic's clients became wary after unpleasant flights, sometimes involving severe turbulence. Others just anticipate a rocky ride. \\"Through treatment, we teach people relaxation skills to better allow them to cope,\\" Spitalnick says. His clinic uses virtual reality technology to simulate a flight. It also uses data and statistics to teach nervous fliers that thousands of flights take off successfully every day. A wide range of treatments are available for people with flying fears. So whether a person hasn't flown in decades or just gets anxious during turbulent flights, he or she should be able to find the right remedy. \\"Over the last 30 years, there have been a lot of treatments that have been developed, and refined,\\" Muskin says. \\"Thirty years ago, there were no treatments at all.\\" Every person's anxiety takes a different form, so their solutions do, too. \\"No two individuals are treated the same way,\\" she says. With the range of remedies, people with flying phobias have a higher chance of curing their fears. \\"People have a lot of success,\\" she says. \\"We know that they can get better.\\" Conquering a fear of flying comes at a cost: Sessions can cost hundreds of dollars, and most patients need more than one. But for many, the cost of living with the phobia and missing important personal and professional obligations can be higher than the price of curing it. For DiScala, the thrill of traveling helped him overcome his fear. \\"I almost think travel is a drug,\\" he says. \\"I love to explore new places.\\" Are you afraid to fly?

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Exercise is recommended for most people with heart failure. The level of exercise you should aim for varies with your age, weight, gender, and physical ability. Talk to your doctor about how much you can and should work out. Some people with heart valve problems should not exercise. Talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise regimen if you already have cardiomegaly or other heart problems. If you are just getting back into exercising, start with a daily walk. You can start with as little as 10 minutes, then work your way up to 30 minutes. High blood pressure causes the heart to work harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body. This can lead to an enlarged heart, by causing enlargement and thickening of the heart muscle. Ask your doctor for medications to lower your blood pressure. Avoid salt and foods high in sodium to reduce your blood pressure. Don’t use diet pills to lose weight. They raise blood pressure. There are many medical disorders that can lead to cardiomegaly. If you have diabetes, amyloidosis, or valvular heart disease, you have a higher risk of cardiomegaly than the general population. Let your doctor know if you have a family history of heart problems. You can also talk to your doctor about getting a blood test done to diagnose potential heart problems. Pay attention to thyroid disorders. Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart. If you have valvular heart disease, you might need medications or surgery. Talk to your doctor about how to treat your valvular heart disease. Anemia can cause a heart to become enlarged. Anemia occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin (a protein found in red blood cells) to carry oxygen to your tissues. Your heart must then pump harder to deliver enough oxygen to the rest of your body. This can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Hemochromatosis occurs when your body cannot metabolize iron properly. A buildup of iron can be toxic to your organs and weaken your heart muscle, leading to an enlarged left ventricle. Get eight hours of sleep each night. Take time out of your day to relax and enjoy yourself by walking around your neighborhood, watching TV, or reading a book. Engage in moderate physical activity for about 30 minutes each day. Limit the amount of salt, caffeine, and fat in your diet. Eat a diet of mostly whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with moderate amounts of protein. Talk to your doctor about exercising. Some individuals with cardiomegaly cannot exercise because it might exacerbate their condition. Use your alarm clock or watch to determine when you should go to bed and wake up each day. Having a regular sleep schedule helps the body adjust to sleeping the right amount. If you have had a heart attack in the past, you are more likely to develop an enlarged heart than people who have not experienced a heart attack. Cardiac muscles cannot regenerate, which means that a part of your heart will be weaker than your normal heart tissue. When your heart has both healthy and weak tissue, the healthy tissue may become enlarged as it is forced to do more work. Drugs and alcohol are connected to 30% of all cases of enlarged hearts. Alcohol and drugs break down heart muscle cells. Heavy drinking, especially, can lead to poor nutrition, which limits the heart’s ability to repair itself. As a result, your heart muscles may become structurally weak, producing enlargement. Therefore, avoid drinking alcohol and using drugs. If you are addicted to drugs or alcohol, speak to a substance abuse counselor. Talk to a therapist to confront the underlying reasons why you drink and abuse drugs. Get support from groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Do not smoke. Risk of heart attack greatly increases in smokers. People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day have more than twice the risk of heart attack than non-smokers. Use nicotine gum and patches to control cravings, and gradually reduce the amount you smoke each week until you’ve kicked the habit. Summary:","completion":"1. Talk to your doctor about exercise, particularly if you have heart problems or a history of heart issues. 2. Start with a daily walk and gradually increase the duration. 3.

A:","completion":"\\"Big cities\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for this question because typically, larger cities have a higher population density, diverse demographics, and bustling urban environments. These factors attract various businesses, including fast food chains as well as local food establishments, to cater to different market segments. In big cities, fast food restaurants are a convenient option for people who are seeking quick, affordable, and familiar meals amidst their busy lifestyles. Additionally, local food choices are more widely available in urban areas, as people usually have a more diverse palate due to the exposure to different cultures and cuisines. Another reason is that big cities tend to attract tourists, and fast food chains may act as familiar options for foreign visitors who may not be comfortable trying new and unknown local food choices. From an economic standpoint, running a fast food restaurant in these populated urban areas can be a profitable venture due to the large customer base, brand recognition, and economies of scale.

Modern history Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of Cossacks. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov. Q: Who are Cossacks?","completion":"Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. They played a significant role in the territorial growth of Russia during the 17th century and were known for their fighting skills and independence. Cossacks often served as border guards and frontier settlers, contributing to the expansion and protection of the Russian Empire. They were essential in various rebellions, uprisings, and explorations that took place during this period, such as the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the exploration of Siberia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"(2). yes; Both questions have the same meaning, as they are asking for ways to detox from meth quickly. It is important to understand that detoxification from any drug can be a complex process and should be approached with care. In the case of methamphetamine detoxification, it is crucial that you consider seeking professional help, as there are no quick and easy ways to detox at home. That being said, here is a detailed approach to detox from methamphetamine: 1. Consult a healthcare professional: Firstly, consult a doctor or a therapist who specializes in addiction recovery. They will provide you with essential guidance and support during the detox process. It is critical to follow their advice and recommendations. 2. Seek a treatment facility: For the safest and most effective method, it is best to enroll in a treatment facility or a detox program that specializes in meth addiction. These programs provide a medically supervised environment, which ensures that the withdrawal symptoms are managed appropriately. 3. Gradual tapering: Depending on your level of addiction, your healthcare professional may recommend gradually reducing your meth consumption until complete cessation. This approach, known as tapering, helps to minimize withdrawal symptoms. 4. Medication assistance: In a medically supervised detox program or under a doctor's supervision, medications might be prescribed to help manage withdrawal symptoms like physical discomfort and mood swings. Some common medications used to assist in meth detox include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety medications. 5. Hydration and nutrition: Staying properly hydrated and maintaining a balanced diet throughout the detox process can help your body recover more quickly. Consuming healthy foods rich in vitamins and minerals is essential. Hydration not only helps in the elimination of toxins from the body but also assists in preventing dehydration caused by withdrawal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting. 6. Physical activity: Engaging in light exercise or physical activity can aid the detox process. Exercise releases endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals, which can alleviate withdrawal symptoms and promote mental and emotional well-being. 7. Sleep: Prioritizing sleep is important during the detox process, as it helps your body and brain to heal and recover. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and practicing relaxation techniques can help improve the quality of your sleep during this challenging period. 8. Support groups: Engaging with a support group or attending meetings focused on addiction recovery, such as Narcotics Anonymous or SMART Recovery, can provide valuable motivation and guidance during the detox process. Remember that detoxing from methamphetamine is not a quick or easy process. It requires time, patience, and commitment. Seeking the help of healthcare professionals and participating in a medically supervised detox program is the most reliable and safest way to detox from meth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: AC Milan are all but through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League after thrashing Arsenal 4-0 at the San Siro on Wednesday. Brazilian striker Robinho scored twice as the Serie A champions dominated the first leg of the last-16 tie with the north London club. Kevin Prince Boateng put Milan ahead in the 15th minute with a sumptuous half-volley after chesting down a chipped pass from Alberto Nocerino. The Ghana midfielder's strike flew in off the underside of the bar leaving Wojciech Szczesny with no chance. Robinho doubled the lead seven minutes before the break heading home a cut-back from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Despite the arrival of Thierry Henry in the second half (his last appearance for the Gunners before he returns to the New York Red Bulls) things quickly went from bad to worse. In the 49th minute, Ibrahimovic and Robinho combined again on the edge of Arsenal's penalty area before a slip by Thomas Vermaelen gifted the Brazilian a free shot which he put past Szczesny with ease. Robine Van Persie forced a fine save from Christian Abbiati in the 65th minute but it was a rare chance for the Dutch striker on a miserable night for Arsene Wenger's team. Ibrahimovic completed the rout converting from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Johan Djourou 12 minutes from the end. \\"We were never in the game, we were very poor both offensively and defensively,\\" Wenger said, AFP reported. \\"It was shocking to see how we were beaten everywhere, it was the worst performance in Europe by far. There was not one moment during the 90 when we were really in the game,\\" he added, AFP reported. The return leg at the Emirates Stadium will be played on March 6. Opinion: Suarez saga harming Liverpool's global brand. In the other Champions League match played Wednesday, Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg came from behind to beat Portugal's Benfica 3-2 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Roman Shirokov scored twice while substitute Sergei Semak got the other. Benfica's goals came from defender Maxi Pereira and Paraguayan striker Oscar Cardozo, both after errors by goalkeeper Yury Zhevnov. Benfica took the lead in the 20th minute courtesy of a goal from Maxi Pereira before Zenit leveled the scores seven minutes later when Shirokov struck a sweet volley to score his first of the night. Semak put Zenit in front in the 71st minute before Oscar Cardozo equalized three minutes from the end. But Zenit responded immediately as Shirokov pounced on a defensive mistake to tap home the winner with two minutes remaining. \\"My players showed really good skill. They showed a lot of heart to win the match in such a grave situation. However they did exactly what we decided to do ahead of the match. We won deservedly tonight,\\" Zenit manager Luciano Spalletti said, AFP reported. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus missed out on the chance to go top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Parma.

In general, the elements that combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetals. This contrasts with ionic compounds, which usually involve bonds between metal ions and nonmetal ions. Because ionic charges cannot be used to name these compounds or to write their formulas, a different naming system must be used for molecular compounds. Another difference between ionic and molecular compounds is that two nonmetal atoms will frequently combine with one another in a variety of ratios. For example, nitrogen and oxygen combine to make several binary compounds, including NO, NO 2 , and N 2 O. Obviously they can’t all be called nitrogen oxide!

Summarize: Trevor Bayliss' side go into the tournament, which starts on 1 June, as favourites in a group alongside Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh. \\"The mindset of the players has changed,\\" Moeen said, referring to the influence of captain Eoin Morgan. \\"He wants us to play without fear and to hit the lights out.\\" Since exiting the 2015 World Cup at the group stages, Morgan has led the team to seven wins in nine. They have defeated New Zealand, Pakistan (twice), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies and most recently Ireland. They only lost to Australia and South Africa by the odd game in five. Much of the credit is given to Morgan and his side's switch from a conservative to an ultra-attacking style of play - England have posted eight scores of 350-plus since 2015 having done so just twice in history before that period. Moeen, who has scored 1061 runs and taken 44 wickets in his 52 one-day internationals, said: \\"Morgan is a very calm person which comes across on TV too. \\"He hardly panics and is very good at controlling his emotions. He is very relaxed which is good from a player's point of view.\\" Batsman Joe Root was announced as England Test captain in February to replace Alastair Cook, who gave up the responsibility after a record 59 Tests. But Moeen believes Yorkshireman Root, who takes charge for the first time in the summer series against South Africa, will make his own mark on the team. \\"Joe is quite a cheeky guy and he will bring that personality into his captaincy. He will take more risks as captain than Cook and bring his own style into the side,\\" Moeen, 29, said at a 'NatWest - Cricket Has No Boundaries' event. \\"He has been the same since becoming England Test captain. I don't think he is going to change too much, he will be the same Joe Root as he has been for the last three years.\\" In the limited-overs game, England lost to India in the final of the last Champions Trophy event in 2013, followed by an agonising final-over loss to West Indies in the World Twenty20 last year. Although they won their first and only ICC global event at the 2010 World T20 against Australia, England have never won an ODI tournament. Asked if there is pressure being expected to win this time, Moeen replies: \\"Not really. The team we have at the moment, we deserve that tag. Playing at home is going to make a massive difference and hopefully we can win the trophy. \\"We have lost a couple of finals recently but over the last couple of years we have played very well in preparation for this Trophy. \\"Hopefully if we get to the final we can overcome the final step and win it. We have gained experience from the T20 World Cup so it will definitely help us.\\" The Champions Trophy takes place from 1 to 18 June, while Ramadan falls during the same period, starting on 26 May and ending on 24 June. As the holy month is happening during the British summer, Muslims will be fasting for around 19 hours, with no food or fluids including water allowed to be consumed.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

Marco Rubio had only kind words for potential Republican presidential rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney on Wednesday, but he argued if he runs he'll have better credentials to offer than the two former governors. \\"I believe that the central obligation of the federal government ... is providing for the national security,\\" he said during a breakfast briefing for reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \\"The next President of the United States needs to be someone who has a clear vision of American's role in the world.\\" \\"For governors that's going to be a challenge, at least initially,\\" Rubio added, \\"since they don't deal with foreign policy on a daily basis.\\" The argument offers an early look at what the Florida senator's primary pitch would be if he does decide to make a play for the White House in 2016. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, Rubio has been an outspoken critic of Obama's foreign policy, and most recently took the lead in opposing the President's move to thaw diplomatic relations with Cuba. And with the GOP primary field shaping up to include potentially a dozen prominent Republicans, Rubio's foreign policy experience could potentially offer him a needed boost to break away from the pack. But on Wednesday he refrained from taking any hits at his potential opponents, calling Bush \\"a very credible candidate\\" and defending Romney against critics who say he ran a gaffe-prone and lackluster campaign in 2012. \\"I don't necessarily think there were flaws in that candidacy,\\" he said. \\"I think oftentimes, we forget that in these campaigns, 90 percent of the outcome is determined by the blocking and tackling of politics. And I think the Obama campaign was a superior campaign operation.\\" He said, however, he's got the support of his family if he wants to run, and he's \\"down to the last decision...the fundamental one.\\" \\"And that is, where is the best place for me to serve the country at this time in my life, at this time in my career?\\" This weekend could bring some clarity to that decision, when his top aides and donors huddle in Miami Beach to discuss the senator's future. Rubio's made one thing abundantly clear, however, and he repeated it Wednesday: He won't try to run for both reelection to the Senate and for president at the same time. \\"If I decide that I want to be president of the United States, that's what I'm going to run for,\\" Rubio said. \\"If I decide to make that decision, it will not be with the intention of looking for a Plan B if it doesn't work out.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Senator Marco Rubio highlighted his foreign policy credentials as an advantage over potential Republican presidential rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.

She wanted everything to be perfect, knowing how much Amayah loved princesses and was excited to have her friends from school be a part of this special day. Weeks ahead, Sarah started working on the party arrangements, brainstorming for creative and unique ideas to make this event magical and unforgettable. After hours of research and consideration, Sarah thought it would be best to have the party at a local park where there was ample space for the children to play and engage in various activities. She found a beautiful spot near a lake in the park, which provided a gorgeous backdrop for the princess-themed decor. Thinking of the enchanting setting, Sarah imagined the children's faces lighting up with joy and excitement as they approached the party. Once the venue was decided, Sarah began working on the invitations. She chose a design that featured an illustrated castle adorned with sparkling tiaras, butterflies, and flowers. In gold calligraphy, the invitations read, \\"Hear ye, hear ye! Princess Amayah is turning 5 and requests your royal presence at her magical birthday celebration.\\" She then personalized each invitation by including the guest's name and sealed them with a beautiful pink ribbon. With the invitations sent out to Amayah's friends, Sarah turned her attention to creating a mesmerizing atmosphere with decorations that would transport the children into a fairytale land. She decided on a color palette of soft pinks, purples, and gold, inspired by Amayah's favorite princesses. To create a castle-like entrance, Sarah ordered an archway made of balloons, along with a personalized banner wishing Amayah a happy birthday. Inside the party area, Sarah arranged for tables and chairs to be set with exquisite linens and centerpieces made of crystal vases filled with fresh flowers. Each place setting had a personalized name card, delicately tied to a pink satin napkin, accompanied by a gold tiara and wand for each guest to take home. To keep Amayah and her friends entertained, Sarah planned various activities for the children, such as princess-themed games like \\"Kiss the Frog\\" and a treasure hunt for a magical gem. She also hired a professional face painter to transform the children into their favorite princesses and princes. Additionally, a surprise visit from a real-life princess, Cinderella, was scheduled to arrive and interact with the children, telling stories, singing songs, and even teaching them a royal dance. As for the food, Sarah ordered a custom-made cake in the shape of a castle with little princess figurines perched on the turrets. She also arranged for an assortment of delectable finger foods like mini sandwiches, fruit kabobs, and macarons for the guests to enjoy. A pink lemonade station, complete with tiara-studded cups, completed the royal menu. Finally, as a token of appreciation for attending Amayah's special day, Sarah prepared lovely party favors. These included an enchanting princess storybook, a bracelet with a little charm, and a photo frame with an image of each friend posing with Cinderella at the party. As the day of the celebration approached, Sarah felt confident that she had executed a detailed and magical event that would leave a lasting impression on not only Amayah but also her young guests.

I found the following answer on Google: However, because negligence cases are very fact-specific, this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is a correct starting point, but it does not completely cover the entire concept of negligence in tort law. To provide a more detailed explanation, let me further clarify the concept and its components. Negligence, as a concept in tort law, pertains to the failure of an individual to exercise reasonable care that results in harm or damage to another person or their property. In other words, negligence arises when someone's actions or omissions fall below the standard of care expected of a reasonably cautious person under the given circumstances. To establish negligence and hold the defendant liable, the plaintiff must prove four primary elements: 1. Duty of Care: The first element to be proven is that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. This means that the defendant had a legal obligation to act with reasonable care toward the plaintiff or be responsible for the plaintiff's well-being. Duty of care may arise from various relationships, such as a driver's duty to other road users or a doctor's duty to their patients. 2. Breach of Duty: The second element involves proving that the defendant breached their duty of care by failing to exercise reasonable care. This can be demonstrated by showing that the defendant's conduct fell short of the standard expected of a person in a similar situation. For instance, a driver who was texting while driving or a property owner who failed to repair a broken handrail. 3. Causation: The third element in a negligence case is proving that the defendant's breach of duty directly caused the plaintiff's injury or harm. This is often referred to as the \\"cause-in-fact\\" or \\"but-for\\" test, meaning that the injury would not have occurred but for the defendant's negligence. For example, if a driver's inattention caused them to rear-end another car, there is a direct causal link between the negligent action and the resulting damage. 4. Damages: The final element in proving negligence requires showing that the plaintiff suffered actual harm or damages as a result of the defendant's negligence. These damages can be physical, emotional, or financial and must be quantifiable. Examples include medical bills, lost income, property damage, or pain and suffering. In tort law, negligence cases vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case. The success of a negligence claim depends on the plaintiff's ability to prove each of these four elements. It is crucial for legal practitioners and plaintiffs to carefully analyze the facts at hand and gather strong evidence supporting each element of negligence to effectively establish liability and seek appropriate compensation for the harm or losses caused by the defendant's negligent actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: After the release of better-than-expected deficit data for 2014, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said there were reasons to be confident about growth. Official data showed the 2014 deficit was 4% instead of the 4.4% forecast, and will fall to about 3.8% this year, Mr Sapin predicted. The eurozone's second biggest economy has held back the euro bloc's growth. Following the improved data, Mr Sapin said economic growth could beat the government's 1% forecast. \\"A lower-than-expected deficit brings confidence,\\" he said. \\"We will do better than 1% (economic) growth in 2015.\\" Public spending has fallen, and last year's expected shortfall in revenues was not a bad as initially thought. \\"Things are falling into place to back the scenario of growth accelerating in 2015,\\" said Credit Agricole economist Axelle Lacan. The eurozone's second-largest economy grew by 0.4% in 2014, the data confirmed on Thursday, the same pace as in 2013. France, which has repeatedly missed its fiscal targets, is confident it will finally bring the deficit below an EU cap of 3% of GDP in 2017. President Francois Hollande, during his 2012 election campaign, had pledged to bring the deficit down to the EU limit by end-2013 but his government has since pushed the target back several times. This month, European Union finance ministers gave France two more years to cut the deficit to the 3% limit, extending the deadline for the third time since 2009. Recent economic data has showed that although unemployment is still rising, business confidence has improved. Summary:","completion":"France found out that they didn't owe as much money as they thought they did in 2014. This makes their Finance Minister, Michel Sapin, feel good about their chances to grow. He thinks things will get better than they planned, and they will be able to follow the rules set by the European Union by 2017. This is good news because France is a big part of the group of countries that use the Euro, and their growth will help everyone else too."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Against the supposition that forest fires in Alaska, Canada and Siberia warm the climate, scientists have discovered that cooling may occur in areas where burnt trees allow more snow to mirror more sunlight into space. This finding suggests that taking steps to prevent northern forest fires to limit the release of greenhouse gases may warm the climate in northern regions. Usually large fires destroyed forests in these areas over the past decade. Scientists predict that with climate warming, fires may occur more frequently over the next several centuries as a result of a longer fire season. Sunlight taken in by the earth tends to cause warming, while heat mirrored back into space tends to cause cooling. This is the first study to analyze all aspects of how northern fires influence climate. Earlier studies by other scientists have suggested that fire in northern regions speed up climate warming because greenhouse gases from burning trees and plants are released into the atmosphere and thus trap heat. Scientists found that right after the fire, large amounts of greenhouse gases entered the atmosphere and caused warming. Ozone levels increased, and ash from the fire fell on far-off sea ice, darkening the surface and causing more radiation from the sun to be taken in. The following spring, however, the land within the area of the fire was brighter than before the fire, because fewer trees covered the ground. Snow on the ground mirrored more sunlight back into space, leading to cooling. \\"We need to find out all possible ways to reduce the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\\" Scientists tracked the change in the amount of radiation entering and leaving the climate system as a result of the fire, and found a measurement closely related to the global air temperature. Typically, fire in northern regions occurs in the same area every 80 to 150 years. Scientists, however, found that when fire occurs more frequently, more radiation is lost from the earth and cooling results. Specifically, they determined when... .Earlier studies about northern forest fires _ .

Now, The New York Times, in its Saturday print edition, is taking the rare step of running a front page editorial calling for tighter gun control laws. The paper has not run a page one editorial since 1920. GOP OFFERS PRAYERS, NOT SOLUTIONS, ON CALIF. MASSACRE \\"We do so today to deliver a strong and visible statement of frustration and anguish about our country's inability to come to terms with the scourge of guns,\\" Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in a statement. \\"Even in this digital age, the front page remains an incredibly strong and powerful way to surface issues that demand attention. And what issue is more important than our nation's failure to protect its citizens?\\" FULL DAILY NEWS COVERAGE OF THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING On Thursday, the News once again took hold of the national debate when it called out pro-gun Republicans who reacted to the California mass shooting with pleas for prayer. The newspaper's headline read simply: \\"God Isn't Fixing This.\\" \\"Wonder if New York Times A1 gun editorial influenced by New York Daily News' forceful anti-gun front pages,\\" CNNMoney's Mark Mooney wrote on Twitter. The decision by the Gray Lady came three days after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino, Calif. in yet another mass attack. \\"Not just the NY Daily News, but fellow Big Apple paper the NY Times is justifiably mad, too,\\" Anthony Dean wrote.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge? , can you please find it? The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden.

In contextul actual al politicii globale, unde probleme precum imigrația, criza economică și securitatea națională sunt preocupări majore, sunt lideri politici care profită de aceste temeri pentru a-și spori popularitatea și a câștiga voturile oamenilor. Acești politicieni, adesea etichetați ca populisti, folosesc argumente bazate pe emoții și pe sentimentul național în detrimentul argumentelor raționale și a faptelor concrete. Manipularea acestor temeri și a argumentelor iraționale a avut un impact semnificativ asupra vieții politice internaționale. Multe dintre țările afectate de către creșterea populismului se confruntă acum cu dezbinare, polarizare și, în unele cazuri, instabilitate. De aceea, este imperativ ca liderii politici care se opun acestui gen de manipulare să lupte împotriva acestei tendințe, promovând transparența, onestitatea și lucrul în echipă în sfera publică. Pentru a combate manipularea bazată pe temeri și argumente iraționale, este esențial ca informațiile să fie corecte și ușor de înțeles pentru cetățeni. Prin încurajarea educației și a accesului la informații, precum și prin promovarea unui discurs public bazat pe respect și toleranță, liderii politici pot contribui la reducerea influenței populismului. În plus, este important ca liderii politici să își asume responsabilitatea de a lua decizii bine fundamentate, bazate pe dovezi și respect pentru drepturile și nevoile tuturor cetățenilor. Aceasta include promovarea unei abordări mai incluzive și participative în procesul decizional, asigurându-se că vocile minorităților și ale celor marginalizați sunt incluse și luate în considerare. Pe termen lung, înfrângerea populismului și a manipulării bazate pe temeri și argumente iraționale va necesita un efort susținut și coordonat din partea liderilor politici, organizațiilor civile și a cetățenilor înșiși. Prin creșterea conștientizării asupra acestor probleme și prin mobilizarea împotriva acestor tactici, se poate contribui la crearea unei societăți mai informate, mai unite și mai rezistente în fața provocărilor viitoare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The states that border Lake Superior in the US are Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, while the Canadian province is Ontario. Lake Superior is not only the largest freshwater lake in the United States but also the largest freshwater lake in North America by surface area. It ranks third globally in volume, only behind Lake Baikal in Russia and Lake Tanganyika in Africa. Its surface area is about 31,700 square miles (82,100 square kilometers), with an average depth of 483 feet (147 meters) and a maximum depth of 1,333 feet (406 meters). Lake Superior is incredibly vast and holds enough water to cover the entire landmass of North and South America to a depth of 1 foot (30 centimeters). It is a vital ecological resource, as it is home to various species of fish, birds, and other wildlife. It also has a significant impact on regional climate, affecting temperatures, precipitation, and land use patterns in the surrounding areas. Economically, Lake Superior is instrumental in supporting both commercial and recreational industries. Shipping and cargo transportation through the St. Lawrence Seaway contribute to trade between the US, Canada, and other nations.

Unable to control B13, the authorities construct a high wall topped by barbed tape around the entire area, forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection behind the containment wall. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. LeÃ¯to (David Belle) is a fighter of such gangs. The beginning of the film depicts LeÃ¯to washing a case full of drugs down the drain, then escaping the gang who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, Taha, kidnaps LeÃ¯to's sister Lola in retaliation; LeÃ¯to is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police arrest LeÃ¯to and let Taha leave with Lola, stating that they're leaving the district.

The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses, but after Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds.

Article: Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK. The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: More and more birds are flying to settle at Qinghai Lake, one of the highest inland lakes in China, thanks to the protection efforts of local governments. Covering an area of over 4,000 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is also the country's biggest salt-water lake. Located in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, the lake is famous for the two islands at its northwest point--Cormorant Island and Egg Island. The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake. To protect this paradise for birds and support calls for ecological protection, China set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone at the end of 1997. Meanwhile, the State has pointed out the Bird Islands and Spring Bay of the Qinghai Lake as central protection zones. Inspection officials and management employees often patrol the lake, improving local residents' knowledge of related laws and spreading knowledge about animal protection to visitors. They are making great efforts to call on people to love and protect the birds. At the same time, they have built special fences around the island area, to prevent wolves, foxes and other carnivorous animals, as well as illegal hunters from breaking up the birds' nest-building, egg-laying and breeding. As a result, more and more birds are coming to the islands for sheltering and breeding. Question: Why are more and more birds coming to the biggest salt-water lake in the Great Northwest? Options: A: Because it is getting warmer and warmer. B: Because it is being reformed C: Because environments there are getting more and more agreeable for them to live in. D: Because the people there are becoming richer and richer Answer:","completion":"C: Because environments there are getting more and more agreeable for them to live in. Step 1: Understand the context - The article talks about the increasing number of birds settling at Qinghai Lake in China due to protection efforts from local governments. Step 2: Identify relevant information - The text mentions that the islands (Cormorant Island and Egg Island) provide rich food sources for birds and that the state has set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone. Also, management employees patrol the area, spreading knowledge about animal protection and making efforts to protect the birds. Step 3: Choose the best answer - Among the given options, Option C directly relates to the improvement of the environment for birds at Qinghai Lake, which is the result of local government protection efforts and conservation initiatives making it more agreeable for birds to live in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: LONDON — The topsy-turvy politics of Britain’s endlessly unpredictable summer took another stunning twist on Monday, with the selection by default of a prime minister who had advocated staying in the European Union but will now come under immediate pressure to fulfill her promise to lead the nation’s exit. Theresa May, the hard-charging home affairs secretary, was elevated to Britain’s top job when the woman who was to spend the summer campaigning against her, Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, preemptively dropped out of the contest to succeed outgoing leader David Cameron. With only one candidate left in the race, the 59-year-old May was named the winner by acclaim, a decision met with table-thumping approval by her fellow Tories in Parliament. She will take the keys to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, once Cameron has had a final turn in the weekly political combat session known as Prime Minister’s Questions. By coalescing around May, her Conservative Party avoided what could have been a bruising months-long campaign that threatened to inflame the still-raw wounds of last month’s E.U. referendum. But the move is also likely to accelerate the pressure on Britain to exit the E.U. European leaders have said Britain must act as quickly as possible to get out, as have Leadsom and other British advocates for a geopolitics-rattling divorce known as Brexit. On Wednesday, Theresa May will become Britain’s next prime minister. She'll become the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher. Here's what you need to know her in 60 seconds. (Karla Adam,Jason Aldag/The Washington Post) May campaigned — if only barely — for the country to stay inside the E.U. But after the “leave” campaign won last month’s referendum and forced the pro-“remain” Cameron from office, May pivoted and said she would back an exit — a stance she reiterated in her victory speech. “Brexit means Brexit, and we are going to make a success of it,” she said Monday afternoon as she stood in front of the gothic towers of Westminster and flashed a smile that is seldom seen on a politician known for her no-nonsense demeanor. [As Britain looks to new leader, a jolt of pressure to speed Brexit] May will become the country’s 76th prime minister, but only the second woman to hold the job following Margaret Thatcher, who stepped down over a quarter-century ago. Although May has been occasionally likened to Thatcher — Britain’s Iron Lady — she has lately been compared to a more contemporary leader: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both May and Merkel were born in the 1950s, the daughters of church pastors. They both inhabit the center-right of European politics but are also known for a strong pragmatic streak. Both are also considered tough negotiators — skills they’ll be putting to use against one another as May seeks a divorce deal with her soon-to-be-former E.U. counterparts. The key question now is when she triggers the start of those talks. She had earlier said she did not want to invoke Article 50 — the never-before-used mechanism for exiting the E.U. — until at least 2017. Her reluctance to move faster has sparked speculation that she might try to find a way to avoid Brexit — a possibility she emphatically rejected Monday, saying that there would be “no attempts to remain inside the E.U., no attempts to rejoin it by the back door, and no second referendum.” Monday’s events make it less likely that she can go back on that pledge, even if she wants to. In dropping out of the race, Leadsom emphasized that she was trying to clear a path for her erstwhile rival to get on with the business of Brexit. The two were supposed to campaign through the summer for the affection of the Conservative Party’s 150,000 members, with the winner due to be announced Sept. 9. [Meet Theresa May on her way to 10 Downing Street] But Leadsom, a relative unknown whose campaign got off to a rocky start after she touted her motherhood as an advantage in a matchup with the childless May, said Monday that she had concluded that “a nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable.” “Business needs certainty,” she said as she stood in front of a dark-brick townhouse in central London. Just last week, Leadsom had earned the right to square off against May in the summer contest by placing second — far behind May — among Conservative members of Parliament. May was considered a strong favorite to win, but Leadsom had vowed to wage a tough campaign. Her decision to drop out came as yet another shock in a country where such remarkable turnabouts have become a regular feature of politics. Since voting last month to leave the E.U. — the biggest stunner of all — Britain has watched mouth agape as politicians have double-crossed each other, scores have been settled and May has emerged from near the back of the pack of prime ministerial candidates to be the only woman left standing. By dropping out, Leadsom triggered a cascade of fast-moving developments. First, May’s former rivals lined up behind her. Michael Gove, the justice secretary who finished third in last week’s winnowing of candidates, quickly endorsed May on Monday. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and a one-time Leadsom backer. Hours later, Cameron walked out the front door of 10 Downing Street for one of the last times, and announced to reporters that he would yield to May by Wednesday. “I’m delighted that Theresa May will be the next prime minister. She is strong, she is competent, she is more than able to provide the leadership that our country is going to need in the years ahead, and she will have my full support,” Cameron said. Cameron said he would chair his last cabinet meeting Tuesday and would attend Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday for a final time as the nation’s leader, six years after he took the job. “After that, I expect to go to the palace and offer my resignation, so we will have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,” he said. On his way back to Downing Street, the still-mic’d-up Cameron hummed a happy tune. A little over an hour later, in brief remarks beside cheering Conservative lawmakers outside Parliament, May promised to “steer us through what will be difficult and uncertain political and economic times.” May, who had raced back to London after a campaign event in Birmingham, appeared to have been caught off guard by Leadsom’s withdrawal — as was nearly everyone in British politics. [The rise of Theresa May highlights Brexit’s greatest irony] May will take office under the mandate that the Conservative Party gained in last year’s general election, having won a narrow majority in Parliament. But the abrupt end of the leadership contest deprives her of the explicit endorsement she was expected to receive from the party’s rank-and-file members. May had earlier said she believed that it was important that the party have a choice in its new leader and that she not take power through “a coronation.” Opposition parties quickly seized on the fact that voters hadn’t had the chance to pick May. The veteran politician is considered to the right of Cameron, having taken a hard line on issues such as immigration and government surveillance. “Tories now have no mandate,” tweeted Tim Farron, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, in a call for new elections. “Britain deserves better than this.” Politicians from the center-left Labour Party joined Farron’s call. But they did so as Labour continued its weeks-long implosion. Angela Eagle, a former top deputy of party leader Jeremy Corbyn, announced Monday that she would challenge Corbyn for his job. Dissidents within Labour, including Eagle, say Corbyn is ill-equipped to lead the party in a general election if the Conservatives decide to call one to renew their mandate. May has said there will be no new vote. But in a season of constant surprise, British political observers say not to rule it out.

Additionally, the speaker adds credibility to their statement with an anecdote about their sister, who was also discussing the same observation. While an anecdote can sometimes be anecdotal evidence and not as reliable as scientific or empirical data, it can still provide personal, real-life experience and examples to solidify this observation in a conversational setting. Considering the information provided in the premise, we can derive that the hypothesis \\"Not many people have achieved that\\" is entailed by it. Both the sentiment behind the speaker's astonishment and the reference to the large number of people who haven't accomplished the task support the hypothesis.

However, the two sentences do not share all information. For example, Sentence 1 does not reveal when Muhammad will be called as a witness, whereas Sentence 2 states that Malvo will be called on Wednesday.

I thought \\"What's New Scooby-Doo\\" was pretty bad (yes, I'm sorry to say I didn't like it), since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" was in the works, I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another \\"Teen Titans\\" or \\"Loonatics Unleashed\\"-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave, too. Also, since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series, Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian), the original voice of Shaggy, will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on \\"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\\") voices Shaggy here. Believe me, the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However, Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also, Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does \\"comical\\" impressions and gives safety tips (\\"Remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!\\"), but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again, the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However, on one episode, \\"Lightning Strikes Twice,\\" they use the \\"Castle thunder\\" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use \\"Castle thunder\\" sound effects since 1991. But my question is, why use \\"Castle thunder\\" on \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue,\\" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on \\"What's New Scooby-Doo!\\" (Two episodes of WNSD used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered, I watched the first episode, and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \\"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \\"Pirates Ahoy\\" movie was actually BETTER than \\"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\\" (and even better than \\"What's New, Scooby-Doo!\\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. But, whether you loved or hated \\"What's New Scooby-Doo,\\" I don't recommend it. But if you HATE the old series, THEN you'll love it! (Oh god, I hope the old Scooby-Doo cartoon stay better than this new #*%!) Anyways, like WNSD, a really bad addition to the Scooby canon.

Later Disney World was opened in Florida in 1971. It cost between 500 and 600 million to build. Tokyo Disney Park opened in Japan in 1983, and Europe Disney opened in France in 1992. Now Hong Kong is going to build a Disney Park and it will be open in 2005. More than 80% of Hong Kong's population would like to visit the Disney Park when it is opened. But about half of them thought the adult admission fee , of between HK 250 to HK 300 (US 32 to US 38), was too high. The children's admission fee is not known yet. But children may not mind paying any entrance fee. \\"If I start saving money now, I'll have enough money to pay the entrance fee in five years' time.\\" Said Chan Posang, a 12-year-old girl. \\" I can't take my son to the Disney Park in the USA.\\" Said Mrs Yu, mother of a small boy, \\"That's why I agree with the government's plan to build one here.

According to the article, more than 80% of Hong Kong's population would like to visit the Disney Park when it is opened, which indicates a strong desire and support for having a Disney Park in their city. However, there are concerns about the high adult admission fee, with about half of the population considering the price of HK 250 to HK 300 (US 32 to US 38) too expensive. Despite these concerns, people like Mrs. Yu, the mother of a young boy, appreciate the opportunity to experience a Disney Park in their own country, comparing the admission fee to the much more significant cost of an air ticket to the USA. While not everyone may be thrilled about the high admission fee, the overall sentiment appears to be positive towards the plan to build a Disney Park in Hong Kong. It is important to note that the question asked in the prompt is whether the answer is \\"Most of them agree with it.\\" With over 80% of the population expressing interest in visiting the park upon its opening, it can be concluded that most Hong Kong people do agree with the plan to build a Disney Park in their city. Furthermore, people like Mrs. Yu and Chan Posang, a 12-year-old girl, are already considering ways to budget and save for the admission fee. This implies that, despite the high cost, many individuals still find value in having a local Disney Park. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the article and the strong interest from the majority of Hong Kong's population, it can be substantiated that most of them agree with the plan to build a Disney Park in Hong Kong. While concerns regarding the high admission fee persist, the excitement and anticipation for the park's opening, as well as the potential positive impact on the local economy, are strong enough to indicate an overall positive outlook on the project from Hong Kong people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Carrera GT was going between 80mph and 93mph when Rodas lost control and crashed in a 45mph zone, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesperson said yesterday, according to NBC Los Angeles. Neither Walker nor Rodas had alcohol or drugs in their system, the spokesperson added; both were wearing seatbelts and the airbags deployed normally. Investigators also revealed that the car's exhaust system had been modified in a way that could allow it to hit higher speeds; its tires were nine years old—five years past the time the owner's manual suggests changing them, but CNN notes that the car was mostly displayed, not driven; and its left rear brake rotor was worn below manufacturer specifications, but that was determined not to have contributed to the accident. Investigators also noted that there was no evidence to support the theory that Rodas may have been racing another vehicle. Expand this summary.","completion":"Following a long period of investigations pursuing the primary cause of the abrupt accident that claimed the lives of Hollywood actor Paul Walker and professional race car driver Roger Rodas in 2013, official confirmation has emerged that unsafe driving was solely to blame. There have been numerous theories and speculations circulating around, suggesting that a mechanical malfunction in the Porsche Carrera GT or poor roadway conditions may have played a significant part in the tragic incident. However, authorities have finally ruled out these assumptions, clarifying that the high-speed driving was the principal factor leading to the fatal crash. As reported by a spokesperson from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Carrera GT, driven by Rodas, was travelling at an astounding speed of between 80mph and 93mph when he tragically lost control of the vehicle. This high-speed pursuit took place in an area demarcated as a 45mph zone, indicating that the vehicle was moving at almost double the speed limit when the crash occurred. This speed reckoning is alarming and underscores the brutality of the crash, as it depicts a glaring disregard for traffic rules and the safety measures associated with them. Another relevant assertion made by the spokesperson, as relayed by NBC Los Angeles, was that neither Walker nor Rodas were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident. This essentially debunks another line of speculation suggesting substance abuse as a potential factor behind the fatal incident. It also further reinforces the assertion that the main culpability lies with the reckless, high-speed driving. Both Walker and Rodas were also found to be adhering to standard safety measures at the time of the incident. They were both wearing seatbelts, and the vehicle's airbags were reported to have functioned as they were supposed to, deploying normally upon impact. Investigators also turned their attention to the Porsche Carrera GT's mechanical condition. The car's exhaust system had been modified in a manner that would allow it to reach higher speeds. This modification suggests the possibility of deliberate attempts to facilitate high-speed driving. Furthermore, it was noted that the Carrera GT was equipped with tires that were nine years old—five years beyond the period recommended for a change in the owner's manual. It is important to note, nonetheless, that CNN reported that the vehicle was primarily displayed, barely driven, which could justify the outdated tires. Additionally, the vehicle's left rear brake rotor was found to be in a degenerated condition wherein it fell below the manufacturer's specifications. However, investigators determined that this deficiency did not contribute to the crash. Lastly, there was speculation that Rodas might have been in a race with another vehicle at the time of the crash. But investigators found no substantial evidence validating this theory. Despite various angles of speculation and examination of different potential causes, the investigators have, in conclusion, firmly imputed the high-speed driving as the single-handed reason behind the tragic accident that led to the loss of two lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: CONTEXT: 11 de enero de 2012 La Fundación Mozilla, tranquilizada después de llevar a cabo el acuerdo pacífico con Google, continúa presentando novedades del navegador Firefox pese al rápido ciclo de actualizaciones. Por primera vez, se lanzará a finales de enero una nueva versión ESR (siglas en inglés de Extended Support Release) que tendrá una duración de casi un año dedicada a los sectores empresariales u organizaciones que quieren ponerse al tanto de la seguridad y comodidad. Según comenta, Jay Sullivan, colaborador en el proyecto Mozilla Enterprise User Working Group, en su blog que las \\"actualizaciones llegarán una vez al año, asegurando así las entregas de seguridad para los navegadores de las empresas pero sin hacer tantos cambios en la Web o en la plataforma de Add-ons\\". La versión que aplicarán los desarrolladores será en la versión 10, que sería lanzada el 31 de enero. Durante ese tiempo deberán migrar los usuarios de la denominada y famosa 3.6, que dejará de ser estable en las próximas semanas. En este caso, tanto el normal (para usuarios comunes) como la extendida seguirán siendo disponibles. Tal y como menciona la wiki de Mozilla, la versión extendida tendrá una duración de 54 semanas teniendo cierta similitud con las versiones LTS del sistema operativo Ubuntu. Para evitar complicaciones, los canales regulares no se interferirán y seguirán siendo los mismos. Por ejemplo, si una versión (10) es lanzada como estable y a la vez es etiquetada como ESR, tendrá dos ciclos: la primera considerada como \\"periodo de calidad\\" que se aplicará para las revisiones criticas de las versiones (10.0.1).

Harvey Cheyne is the spoiled son of American business tycoon Frank Burton Cheyne. Harvey is shunned by his classmates at a private boarding school, and eventually suspended for bad behavior. His father therefore takes him on a business trip to Europe, travelling there by trans-Atlantic steamship. Mid passage, Harvey falls overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is rescued by a Portuguese-American fisherman, Manuel Fidello, and taken aboard the fishing schooner \\"We're Here\\", from Gloucester, Massachusetts. Harvey is shocked the schooner's captain, Disko Troop, intends fishing in the Atlantic for three more months. He fails to persuade the captain to take him back to New York nor can he convince him of his wealth; but Captain Disko offers Harvey temporary crew membership until they return to port. Harvey is reluctant to do real work but eventually accepts. Befriended by Captain Troop's son, Dan, he becomes acclimated to the demanding fishing lifestyle. The We're Here fills with fish they catch. When a prank of Harvey's causes a fish hook to lodge in a crewman's arm, Manuel defends the boy.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more or less ): Barry is connecting new wires to his speakers. His new wires are thicker than the old ones, therefore, he should expect that the electrical current will display more or less resistance than his older, thinner ones? The answer is:","completion":"Less resistance. The answer to the question is that Barry should expect less resistance in the electrical current with his new, thicker wires as compared to the older, thinner ones. This is because the relationship between the wire's thickness (cross-sectional area) and resistance is inversely proportional, meaning that as the cross-sectional area of the wire increases, the resistance offered by the wire decreases. The reason behind this is rooted in the basic principles of electricity and the conductive nature of materials. In a conductive material, such as the copper or aluminum that is commonly used in speaker wires, the atoms in the material have electrons in their outer electron shells that are relatively free to move. When a voltage is applied across the wire, these free electrons can move from one atom to another, creating an electric current. The resistance of a wire is primarily determined by three factors: 1. Material – Different materials have varying levels of electrical resistance. For example, copper has lower resistance than aluminum for the same given wire size, which is why copper is often preferred for electrical installations. 2. Length – The longer the wire, the greater the total number of atoms the electrons must move through, which results in higher resistance. 3. Cross-sectional area – A thicker wire has more conductive material available for electrons to move through, which reduces the resistance. So in the case of Barry's new thicker speaker wires, the increased cross-sectional area provides more pathways for electrons to flow through, effectively reducing the resistance offered by the wire. As a result, Barry should expect less resistance in the electrical current with his new, thicker wires compared to his older and thinner ones, leading to a potentially clearer and more efficient signal transmission between his audio system and speakers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. The answer is:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what are the two main rules for driving safely on icy roads during winter? A. Drive aggressively and pay attention only to the car in front of you B. Drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen C. Always use high-beam headlights and avoid using brakes D. Speed up on icy roads and stay in a single lane Answer: B. Drive smoothly and pay attention to what might happen Justification: According to the article, Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. This is suggested because sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. To ensure safety, one should aim to drive as gently and slowly as possible, as if not wanting to spill a full cup of hot coffee seated next to them. Rule Number Two mentioned in the article is to pay attention to what might happen. The article advises looking further down the road as more ice is present, and adjusting the stopping distance depending on road conditions (double on wet roads, triple on snow, and even more on ice). This emphasizes the importance of staying aware and in control to avoid potential accidents during winter driving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(CNN) -- The Tamil Tigers have been invited by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lay down their arms after government forces retook the city of Kilinochchi Friday, once the center of power for the rebel group. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa has called on the Tamil Tigers to stop fighting. But while Colombo celebrated the government success with fireworks, within an hour a suicide bomber abruptly shattered whatever hopes the president may have had for immediate peace. The bomber, riding a motorcycle, blew himself up outside air force headquarters in Colombo, killing two air force police officers and a member of the bomb-disposal unit, authorities said.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Just up the road from the memorial of stuffed animals and candles that has become a place of pilgrimage and protest over the shooting death of Michael Brown, there is an empty parking lot where another young black man was killed last week on the night this city erupted in rage. There are no rallies or news cameras there, no signs or ribbons to mark the spot where, the police say, Deandre Joshua, 20, was shot once in the head and then set on fire inside his car. He was the only person killed during the fires, looting and riots that shook the city after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in Mr. Brown’s killing. But in the days since, Mr. Joshua’s death has largely become a footnote to Ferguson’s story — an open homicide case and a bitter mystery for his family. “The unknown is what scares me,” his mother, Maria, 39, said in an interview at her home in nearby University City, where her son and his identical twin brother, Dont’A (Don-TAY), shared the basement. “I don’t know what happened to him.” The police have offered few details about the killing. Chief Jon Belmar of the St. Louis County Police suggested last week that there could be “a nexus” between the broader unrest and Mr. Joshua’s death, but a police spokesman said it remained unclear whether there was any direct link. The police have not named any suspects, and have said it was unclear precisely when Mr. Joshua was killed or why his body was burned. ||||| Close Get email notifications on Joel Currier daily!

Please briefly summarize this news article: Rep. Charles Rangel reflects on his censure and his legacy After it was all over - the bear hugs, the whispers, the somber theatricality - one question lingered about Charlie Rangel's censure, and it was wider than Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard in Harlem. How did the savvy old pol let this happen? How did one of the shrewdest operatives in the House of Representatives, a man who rose to become chairman of the most powerful committee, Ways and Means, an expert in tax law and spending procedures, a hero to black America, get caught chiseling on his taxes? How did he let himself become the latest example of ethical lapses in Congress? Weeks after he was censured by the House - a rebuke suffered by only 22 others in congressional history - Rangel, 80, sat for two interviews in his Capitol Hill office. Reviewing the events of the past two years, his answers were full of contradictions that seem to defy easy explanation. He doesn't bother to conceal his rage and lashes out, in that deep Orson Welles voice, in many directions: He admits he made mistakes, but also lays blame upon a conservative ethics group and their efforts to expose him. He fingers a former chief of staff who he says didn't pay attention to details. And he laments a political climate in which veteran members of Congress are treated like the amateur performers at Harlem's Apollo Theater (which Rangel helped save from extinction), their fate dependent on the whim of the audience. \\"Nothing I did was inconsistent with what I thought was legal. It wasn't done in the dark of night!\\" The voice is roaring away, yelling indiscriminately at everyone in the room. He begins riffling through papers on his desk as if a document or folder might include the magic of belated redemption. \\"If there's no corruption, then the corruption shouldn't have been an issue,\\" said Rangel, who served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon. \\"Nobody's been censured when there hasn't involved the breaking of any laws.\\" The ethics committee, chaired by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), concluded that Rangel had not paid taxes for 17 years on property he owns in the Dominican Republic, where he sometimes vacations. It said he raised \\"millions\\" of dollars for the Rangel Center at City College of New York from corporations that did business before his Ways and Means Committee. And it concluded that he had accumulated more than 500,000 in undisclosed financial assets. While taking blame for what he termed \\"overzealousness\\" in fundraising, Rangel chided members of Congress who voted for censure instead of a less serious reprimand, howled about a double standard, vowed that this episode \\"is not over yet\\" and complained bitterly about the National Legal and Policy Center, a Falls Church-based organization that chases after public officials who may have ethics issues. \\"For a chairman to violate House rules, well, I don't feel good about that,\\" he said. \\"If it was done because I relied on my chief of staff, George Dalley, a Columbia Law School graduate, smart man, well, again, I do feel bad. But I didn't get a nickel!\\" Rangel repeatedly mentioned people who have expressed support for him or minimized the import of the ethics violations. He recounted a train ride from Manhattan to Washington earlier that day, replete with the familiar pats on the back and warm handshakes. \\"Henry Kissinger grabbed me on the train . . . and said, 'You got a bum deal. You're still my congressman.' He asked me: 'Why did they vote against you?' And all I could say was: 'Congress is held in such low esteem!' \\" He likes this theme of Congress and public perception. \\"Representatives didn't want to look soft on corruption - even if it wasn't corruption!\\" he said. He's started combing his hair. He's at the refrigerator grabbing a 32-ounce bottle of soda and taking a swallow. \\"I think the reputation of Congress is so low that to vote for me would have been seen as being soft on crime. Soft on misconduct.\\" Summary:","completion":"This article discusses Representative Charles Rangel's reflections on his censure and his legacy.

UPDATED:. 07:12 EST, 3 May 2013. Little Ireland Nugent's parents have been trying to tell her their 2-year-old daughter that her legs have been amputated but they're having a hard time. Three weeks ago, an horrific lawn-mower accident in Palm Harbor, Florida severed both of her legs below the knees. Her mother Nicole Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times that they were trying to find the words in the the hope that she would understand. Scroll down for video... Still my little girl: Jerry Nugent hugs his daughter, Ireland, in a Florida hospital. Just three weeks ago he accidentally cut off his daughters' legs after running her over with his lawnmower. Brave: Ireland's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb. Brave: Her parents are adament that their little girl, Ireland, will walk again. 'We were playing with Mr. Potato Head yesterday and taking the feet on and off and I said, 'This is going to be like you, Ireland. We're going to take your feet on and off.' She doesn't really understand. She's honestly so little that I don't really think she gets that.' Brave Ireland has asked virtually no questions about the past, but her parents worry about what is to come. So far she's already had to undergo seven operations and now her parents, Jerry and Nicole are looking into prosthetic-limb providers and group therapy for themselves and their other children. Incredibly, Ireland is managing to smile through it all and is keeping far calmer than her parents. Simplicity: Ireland's mom, Nicole, is trying to get her daughter used to the idea of prosthetic leg. She told her that she was going to be like Mr Potatohead. Harrowing ordeal: Ireland, seen here in her hospital bed, has had to undergo seven surgeries since her accident three weeks ago. She is heavily drugged-up with pain medication and one of her arms is in cast. However, when media were allowed to visit the girl for the first time yesterday, they reported that Ireland appeared to be awake, alert and full of curiosity with her cheeks sporting a healthy glow. She was given a package of Play-doh and animal-shaped cookie cutters. It's Ireland's smile that helps strengthen her family. 'She's just happy and spunky and it keeps us going,' her mom, Nicole said. 'She's been very strong through this whole process. In fact, it's been hard for us to even read that she's in pain at times. I kind of have to read her physical cues because she just doesn't cry.' On Tuesday, her dad said that he was rubbing the ends of his daughter's legs. The idea was to alleviate the 'phantom limb' sensations that trouble many amputees. 'I love your little legs,' he told her. 'Thank you, daddy,' she replied. Comforting: The family are trying to make things as normal as possible for the little girl, even while she is still in hospital. Support: The family say the support from the community has been overwhelming. Her hospital room is awash with cards, toys and balloons. Support: Ireland Nugent's mom and dad have been with her every day since the accident on April 11th. The little girl was injured on April 11th when she ran after her father, Jerry, as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home. Her mother, Nicole, frantically waved at him to stop, but he misunderstood and put the lawn mower in reverse backing over his child. Both her legs were severed below the knee. Her hand was also cut and her thumb broken. The Nugents say the financial and moral support they've received from the community has been overwhelming. Balloons, toys, and cards fill her hospital room. A fund established for Ireland's medical care and expenses at Trinity Presbyterian had raised about 85,000 and the family are continuing to raise money. Bright future: Doctors plan to fit the toddler with prosthetic legs in a few weeks once her wounds dry and heal. The family is already making plans to have Ireland fitted for prosthetic limbs in Orlando. Two funds have been set up to accept donations for Ireland Nugent's family. •. Trinity Presbyterian Church: Checks can be made out to 'Trinity. Presbyterian Foundation' (with 'Ireland Nugent' on the memo line) and. sent to Trinity Presbyterian Church, 2001 Rainbow Drive, Clearwater, FL. 33765. Or donate by credit card online: trinityclearwater.org. •. The Pinellas County government has arranged for a special fund through. Pinellas Federal Credit Union in Ireland Nugent's name. Find details. online at pinellasfcu.org or call (727) 586-4422. Her mother says she and her husband are looking towards the future and working out how they will cope when Ireland returns home. They will have to make adjustments to the family home in order to make life as easy as possible for the little girl. Her siblings may also need some counseling as they adjust to life without Ireland's legs. Later today, doctors will do a final check of two skin grafts to make sure they've healed. If they have it would mean Ireland is one step closer to coming home. Her mother told WSTP: 'This has been the biggest nightmare of my life, honestly. I never imagined that this would happen to her, but through this have come so many blessings,' Nicole says. 'First, she lived, and we didn't know when it first happened if that was going to happen.' Ireland's father agrees. 'When I see her, it's just like a weight is lifted and I know she's there and she's going to be okay.'","completion":"In a tragic accident in Palm Harbor, Florida, 2-year-old Ireland Nugent had both her legs amputated below the knees following a horrific lawn-mower accident.

Logan had to remind Benjamin to take the medicine because Benjamin was very bad with keeping track of schedules. Despite being an intelligent and capable individual, Benjamin found it difficult to manage his day-to-day tasks effectively. This had been a consistent issue for him throughout his life as he often forgot important deadlines, missed appointments, and even misplaced essential items. Logan, on the other hand, was highly organized and meticulous when it came to planning and time management. She was exceptionally skilled at balancing work, personal life, and self-care. As such, she could easily remember important dates and appointments without breaking a sweat. Moreover, Logan understood the importance of consistency, particularly when it came to health-related routines, such as medication management. That's why, realizing that Benjamin could easily fall into a pattern of neglecting his medicine regime, she took it upon herself to remind him to take his medicine whenever needed. Logan's efforts were motivated by her genuine concern for Benjamin's well-being. She knew that in order for him to maintain his health, it was crucial to adhere to the prescribed medication schedule. In order to help Benjamin improve his time management, Logan suggested that he start using a planner or calendar. She also recommended setting reminders on his phone, or even using a smart speaker that could be programmed with alarms for his medicine. She believed that with the right tools and some determination, Benjamin could eventually become more organized and efficient when it came to managing his schedule. To further assist Benjamin, Logan offered to periodically check in with him to ensure that he was making progress. She wanted to show her support and provide encouragement in his journey towards better organizational skills. With time, Logan hoped that these efforts would become less necessary as Benjamin developed a routine, but for now, she was dedicated to helping her friend overcome his challenges. To Logan, this minor act of kindness was really just an extension of their friendship. She cared for Benjamin deeply and wanted him to succeed in all aspects of life. It was not without its challenges, as Benjamin occasionally resisted her help and preferred to try to manage things on his own. However, Logan's persistence and continued support eventually led to a positive change in Benjamin's habits. In the end, Benjamin learned the value of time management and prioritizing tasks, and he also discovered the importance of maintaining a consistent medicine regimen. Thanks to Logan's unwavering support and assistance, he was able to overcome his scheduling deficiencies and lead a happier, healthier, and more organized life. And through this experience, their bond as friends only grew stronger, as they both came to appreciate and rely on one another in new ways."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Filipino that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: Of the first team players that were offloaded by Watford, who had the longest career? Passage 1:The Green Hornet was adapted into two movie serials, 1940's The Green Hornet and, in 1941, The Green Hornet Strikes Again! Disliking the treatment Republic gave The Lone Ranger in two serials, George W. Trendle took his property to Universal Pictures, and was much happier with the results. The first serial, titled simply The Green Hornet (1940), starred Gordon Jones in the title role, albeit dubbed by original radio Hornet Al Hodge whenever the hero's mask was in place, while The Green Hornet Strikes Again! (1941) starred Warren Hull. Keye Luke, who played the \\"Number One Son\\" in the Charlie Chan films, played Kato in both. Also starring in both serials were Anne Nagel as Lenore Case, Britt Reid's secretary, and Wade Boteler as Mike Axford, a reporter for the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper that Reid owned and published. Ford Beebe directed both serials, partnered by Ray Taylor on The Green Hornet and John Rawlins on The Green Hornet Strikes Again!, with George H. Plympton and Basil Dickey contributing to the screenplays for both serials. The Green Hornet ran for 13 chapters while The Green Hornet Strikes Again! had 15 installments, with the Hornet and Kato smashing a different racket in each chapter. In each serial, they were all linked to a single major crime syndicate which was itself put out of business in the finale, while the radio program had the various rackets completely independent of each other. Passage 2:In 1954, he returned to California and signed with 4-Star Publishing as a songwriter and demo tape recorder. Patsy Cline recorded his \\"Turn the Cards Slowly\\" for a minor hit. Interested in furthering his chances at a successful career in rockabilly, Masters recorded \\"Pink Cadillac\\" and \\"Whop-T-Bop\\" with guitarist Jimmy Bryant and released them on 4-Star in 1956, but neither sold well. Follow-ups \\"Angel\\" and \\"Jodie\\" were no more successful, even after Masters's touring schedule and television appearances on The Jack Benny Show and Town Hall Party. His contract with 4-Star ended in 1957, and he wrote for American Music for a few years. \\"Rockin' Red Wing\\" was issued on Warner Bros. Records in September 1959 before signing with Lode Records in 1960. Lode re-issued \\"Rockin' Red Wing\\" in January that year, which became a regional hit in Los Angeles and eventually reached No. 64 on the Billboard Hot 100. It gave Masters his only appearance in the UK Singles Chart when it peaked at No. 36 in June 1960. His next single, \\"Golden Slippers\\", was released nationally by Dot Records, but it was not a success, and neither was \\"Pierre the Poodle\\", his last release before losing his recording contract.

You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \\"sixth sense\\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed.

Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.

When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u Question: In most US universities, _ . - college students are offered the co-op program - electives' credits make up one quarter of the required credits - all students are required to finish four-year education before graduation - some excellent students can graduate ahead of time Answer:","completion":"In most US universities, some excellent students can graduate ahead of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup. Although they are not successful, Northup is left on the noose for hours before he is finally cut down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps.

Henry Answer:","completion":"Title: A Ripple in Time Genre: Drama, Mystery, Sci-fi Plot Summary: The movie revolves around the lives of Henry, a young and ambitious journalist, and Clare, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. It tells the story of how their paths cross when Clare's father accidentally shoots Henry, causing a series of events that alter their lives forever. The incident unveils interconnected mysteries involving time travel, betrayal, and family secrets that, once unraveled, change the perspectives of the central characters. Act 1: Henry is a journalist working on an investigative report about a mysterious time traveler who may hold secrets to the town's missing persons. Clare, a talented artist, lives a privileged life under her overbearing father's shadow. She longs to break free and pursue her dreams without her family's wealth. Act 2: During one of his investigations, Henry stumbles upon an old journal belonging to a man named Robert, who claims to have time-traveled and foreseen critical events, including the incident of Clare's father accidentally shooting Henry. When Clare's father, a renowned inventor, mistakens Henry for an intruder and shoots him, Henry survives but is left in a coma. Act 3: In her search for answers, Clare discovers her father's secret lab, where he's been working on a time-travel machine. It turns out her father is Robert—the time traveler from the journal. In an attempt to change her father's ways, Clare decides to go back in time with intentions of preventing the incident and gaining her own independence. Act 4: Landing in the past, Clare encounters a younger Robert and realizes the root of her father's obsession with time travel—his wife's (Clare's mother) tragic death in a car accident. Seeing an opportunity to change the course of their lives, Clare saves her mother, preventing her death. Act 5: As the timeline shifts, Clare returns to the present, finding her family changed and happier. However, she realizes that, unintentionally, her actions created a ripple effect, changing Henry's fate as well. Instead of being a journalist shot by her father, Henry is now a police officer, one who investigates her father's illegal activities tied to his inventions. Together, they expose Clare's father's secrets, and he is arrested. Epilogue: With her father facing the consequences of his actions, Clare is liberated and moves on to explore her dreams as an independent woman. Henry, realizing the intertwining nature of their lives, resigns from the force, and uncovers his passion for journalism again. As their paths cross in a new light, Clare and Henry come together with an unspoken bond, knowing the unique experiences they had been through. Thus, their incredible journey transcends the challenges of time and forges a bond that echoes across the ever-changing multiverse."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

The superpowers, which include the Dutch and British colonial governments, desired to acquire and maintain control over Southeast Asian colonies for the extraction of their vast resources and the exploitation of their large markets. By dissolving both the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company, the respective governments aimed to establish direct administration over the colonies to better capitalize on the potential profits from resources and markets in the region. In doing so, colonial rule heavily impacted Southeast Asia's development, with both positive and negative effects.

However, it must be noted that while this exploitation perhaps led to the development of the region to a certain extent, it also had economic, social, and political ramifications for the Southeast Asian colonies.

Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States.

Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds. - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex. - \\"Maybellene\\" is one of the first rock-and-roll songs. It was written and recorded in 1955 by Chuck Berry, and inspired/adapted from the Western Swing fiddle tune \\"Ida Red,\\" which was recorded in 1938 by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Berry's song tells the story of a hot rod race and a broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single by Chess Records, of Chicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single and his first hit. \\"Maybellene\\" is considered one of the pioneering rock-and-roll songs: \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine wrote, \\"Rock & roll guitar starts here.\\" The record is an early instance of the complete rock-and-roll package: youthful subject matter; a small, guitar-driven combo; clear diction; and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement. The lyrics describe a man driving a V8 Ford chasing his unfaithful girlfriend in her Cadillac Coupe DeVille. - Charles Edward Anderson \\"Chuck\\" Berry (born October 18, 1926) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as \\"Maybellene\\" (1955), \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - A novelty song is a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs. The term arose in Tin Pan Alley to describe one of the major divisions of popular music. The other two divisions were ballads and dance music. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. - \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\", from the live side of the album, was edited to approximately 4 minutes for release as a single. It was Berry's first and only single to reach number 1 in both the US and the UK. - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw. - Tin Pan Alley is the name given to the collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and a plaque exists (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"No. The answer provided does not directly address the question \\"how does weather happen?\\" The concept of weather formation is a totally natural process driven by the laws of physics. Everyone knows that weather conditions vary from day to day, but we might not know why this happens. Weather is primarily caused by processes and changes in the Earth's atmosphere, especially interactions with sunlight. The sun warms up the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth, creating wind, pressure changes, and temperature variations. These changes in turn cause processes such as evaporation (where water is transformed into vapor) and condensation (where vapor becomes liquid). Additionally, the rotation of the Earth influences wind and pressure patterns, and the planet's tilt relative to its orbital plane determines its seasonal weather patterns (i.e., winter, spring, summer and autumn). Extreme weather phenomena (storms, hurricanes, etc) are usually caused by more complex, large scale interactions of the factors mentioned above.

Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity.

The families soon become friends, and their sons join the Discoverers, a Scouts-style group. Actions of the Langs arouse latent suspicion in Michael. Michael sees blueprints in the Lang's house which are not for the building project Oliver, an architect, claims, and a wrongly delivered letter suggests he lied about where he attended college. Over dinner, Michael describes impersonal treatment from the government after his wife, an FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty. Oliver states his belief that the government should be punished for its mistakes. Michael's girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), and his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), dismiss Michael's concerns as paranoia. On a field trip to the site of the standoff in which his wife was killed, Michael describes to his college class what he sees as a needless tragedy: that although certain activities of the besieged family raised \\"flags,\\" other facts, not investigated before the FBI visit, both exonerated them and explained their wariness of the FBI agents, which provoked the standoff. Michael's students appear uneasy at the intensity with which Michael condemns the FBI's actions.

Afternoon: This choice is improbable, as the party animals are described to have started drinking in the evening. It wouldn't make chronological sense for them to finish in the afternoon, as it comes before the evening. 2. Dusk: Dusk usually refers to a short period of time around sunset. Since the party animals began drinking in the evening, this would imply that their party would last for a very short duration, only covering the period around sunset. This seems uncharacteristic for a group described as \\"party animals,\\" who typically party for longer durations. 3. Daytime: This option includes both morning and afternoon. As established earlier, finishing in the afternoon would not make chronological sense. If we consider the morning as the end of the party, it still doesn't capture the full spirit of a \\"party animal\\" who parties until they can't anymore. While possible, it is not the most likely option. 4. Night: This answer is too vague as it doesn't specifically indicate when during the night the party would end. Nighttime could include the early hours of the night, late-night, or even dawn. However, since they started drinking in the evening, ending their party early in the night would be unlikely for party animals. 5. Dawn: This option suggests that the party animals partied through the entire night and only stopped once the sun started to rise. This is consistent with the behavior and enthusiasm of a group described as \\"party animals.\\" They are known for their high energy levels and commitment to partying for long durations, often until the next daybreak. Based on these points, it's reasonable to conclude that \\"dawn\\" is the most fitting answer. It aligns with the typical behavior and nature of party animals, who revel in prolonged parties and often cease their celebrations at the break of dawn. This choice not only accurately emphasizes their dedication to merrymaking but also adheres to the chronological order, thus making \\"dawn\\" the correct answer in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ex-CIA Director David Petraeus, who was whisked clandestinely into private meetings with Congress on Friday to avoid reporters, expressed regret anew in an appearance that marked his first official business since he resigned in disgrace over an extramarital affair.

(Associated Press) Senate Intelligence Committee member Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Nov. 16, 2012 following the committee's closed-door hearing where former CIA... (Associated Press) In ways befitting a spy, the former four-star general was sneaked into a secure room beneath the Capitol to escape a clamorous crowd of photographers and television cameras. After more than four hours, Petraeus left much the way he came and was seen departing in a two-vehicle motorcade. About 20 minutes later, The Associated Press photographed Petreaus entering his home _ one of the only public images of him since he resigned. The scandal over Petraeus' affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, has preoccupied Washington, even as the possibility of war loomed in Israel and the U.S. government faced a market-rattling \\"fiscal cliff\\" that could imperil the economy. So far, the scandal has ensnared Petraeus; the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen; two Florida socialites; and a decorated FBI counterterrorism agent. Across town, the White House acknowledged Friday that Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite who inadvertently triggered the FBI investigation that uncovered Petraeus' affair, visited the Executive Mansion three times in the last three months with her sister, Natalie, twice eating in its mess. Kelley and her sister _ both are friends with Petraeus and Allen _ were guests of a mid-level White House aide, according to an Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because those visitor records have not yet been made public. Kelley and her family also received a tour of the mansion. The White House also acknowledged that Broadwell visited there twice since 2009. In his Capitol Hill appearances, Petraeus, who until last week was among America's most respected military leaders, discussed with the House and Senate intelligence committees the September attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead. He did not discuss his adultery with Broadwell, except to say that he regretted his behavior and that his departure was unrelated to the deadly violence in Libya. The scandal has led to a new CIA internal investigation. \\"He was very clear his resignation was tied solely to his personal behavior,\\" said Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., a member of the Intelligence Committee. \\"He was apologetic and regretful but still Gen. Petraeus.\\" Unlike previous appearances at the Capitol, when Petraeus walked through the front door and greeted reporters, he was smuggled inside through a network of underground hallways. Police closed down entire corridors in the Capitol. Members of Congress said they made arrangements to spare Petraeus embarrassment and humiliation. Before the scandal, he famously cultivated personal relationships with journalists and served as the U.S. war commander in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, apologized to reporters and photographers for the stringent security. \\"I know that's wrankling you,\\" Feinstein said. \\"We didn't want to make it any more difficult for him. And you know, you people aren't always the easiest. So the blame is on us. Any waiting that you did, I apologize, but, you know, there's a lot of suffering going on.\\" Feinstein said no senators asked Petraeus about the affair. A congressional staffer who attended one of the closed briefings said talk about the sex scandal was off the table. Petraeus, 60, publicly acknowledged last week that he had cheated on his wife of 38 years with Broadwell, 40. It wasn't until Oct. 26 that Petraeus acknowledged the affair to FBI agents, during their second interview of him, a federal law enforcement official disclosed Friday. The official was not authorized to speak on the record about the ongoing case and requested anonymity for that reason. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are expected to meet next week to discuss the recent stumbles of two of the military's top generals, said Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of U.S. Naval Operations. The joint chiefs want to review ethics, accountability and behavioral issues and determine whether senior officials are living up to the military's standards, Greenert said Friday at the National Press Club. The FBI began investigating the case against Broadwell last summer but didn't notify the White House or Congress until after the election. In the investigation, the FBI uncovered flirtatious emails between Allen and Kelley, both of them married. On Friday, two U.S. officials said investigators have found just a handful of the emails between Allen and Kelley to be potentially problematic. They said investigators determined the vast majority of the 20,000-plus pages of documents were routine. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. President Barack Obama has put a promotion nomination for Allen on hold. Kelley's emails triggered the eventual downfall of Petraeus and placed others under scrutiny. Kelley knew Petraeus and Allen from the Tampa social scene when they were stationed at nearby MacDill Air Force Base. It was there that the mid-level White House aide who hosted her at the Executive Mansion met her, said the White House official. Broadwell attended two meetings in the White House's executive office building. In 2009 she met with a member of Obama's national security staff and in June 2011 she joined about 20 people for a briefing on Afghanistan and Pakistan policy, the official said. The 2011 meeting was just a few hours before Obama gave a prime-time speech about withdrawing troops from Iraq. Petraeus, in his first media interview since he resigned, told CNN this week that he had never given classified information to Broadwell. She has said she didn't receive such material from Petraeus. But the FBI found a substantial number of classified documents on Broadwell's computer and in her home, according to the law enforcement official, and is investigating how she got them. The Army has now suspended her security clearance. The official outlined new details Friday of the timing of the FBI investigation that showed that agents spent the summer making certain that no one had hacked into Petraeus' computers to track his movements _ a potential national security vulnerability raised by some of the first emails they saw in the case. They also used the summer to rule out any possibility he somehow participated in harassing Kelley by email. After that, in early fall, Broadwell was interviewed by the FBI and agents searched her computers and found substantial amounts of classified documents, the law enforcement official said. The focus of the investigation shifted and agents spent most of October working with the Pentagon to determine where she got the documents, their significance and her right to have them. The CIA on Thursday opened an exploratory investigation into Petraeus' conduct. The inquiry \\"doesn't presuppose any particular outcome,\\" said CIA spokesman Preston Golson. At the same time, Army officials say that, at this point, there is no appetite for recalling Petraeus to active duty to pursue any adultery charges against him. ___ Associated Press writers Nedra Pickler, Larry Margasak, Adam Goldman, Jim Kuhnhenn, Lolita C. Baldor, Pete Yost, Donna Cassata, Henry C. Jackson and Robert Burns contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON — David H. Petraeus , the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told lawmakers on Friday that classified intelligence reports revealed that the deadly assault on the American diplomatic mission in Libya was a terrorist attack, but that the administration refrained from saying it suspected that the perpetrators of the attack were Al Qaeda affiliates and sympathizers to avoid tipping off the groups. Mr. Petraeus, who resigned last week after admitting to an extramarital affair, said the names of groups suspected in the attack — including Al Qaeda’s franchise in North Africa and a local Libyan group, Ansar al-Shariah — were removed from the public explanation of the attack immediately after the assault to avoiding alerting the militants that American intelligence and law enforcement agencies were tracking them, lawmakers said. In his first public appearance since he resigned last week, Mr. Petraeus testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in back-to-back closed-door hearings as lawmakers from both parties continued to wrestle with questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the Sept. 11 attacks in Benghazi that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans and why its public portrayal conflicted with the intelligence agencies’ classified assessments. “They knew right away that there were terrorists involved in the operation,” said Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. During his testimony, Mr. Petraeus expressed regret for his affair. Lawmakers did not ask him about it. In addition to what the administration knew about assailants, they focused their questions on possible security lapses at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, particularly given a spate of attacks this year in Benghazi against the American Mission, the British ambassador’s convoy and the Red Cross. State Department officials have said five diplomatic security officers were at the mission on Sept. 11, including two traveling with Mr. Stevens. They were initially up against more than 50 fighters, armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, who easily breached the compound and set fire to it. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said Mr. Petraeus’s testimony showed that “clearly the security measures were inadequate despite an overwhelming and growing amount of information that showed the area in Benghazi was dangerous, particularly on the night of Sept. 11.” But many of the questions from lawmakers dealt with how the intelligence services and the administration over all responded to a request from the House committee for unclassified talking points about what happened, in advance of a closed briefing by Mr. Petraeus on Sept. 14, three days after the attack. The issue took on added resonance after Republicans criticized the ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, for suggesting on Sunday talk shows five days after the assault that the siege in Benghazi was a spontaneous protest rather than an opportunistic terrorist attack. Democrats leapt to Ms. Rice’s defense on Friday, saying she was simply following the unclassified talking points provided to her. “I really think Ambassador Rice is being treated unfairly,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee. The talking points initially drafted by the C.I.A. attributed the attack to fighters with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the organization’s North Africa franchise, and Ansar al-Shariah, a Libyan group, some of whose members have Al Qaeda ties. Mr. Petraeus and other top C.I.A. officials signed off on the draft and then circulated it to other intelligence agencies, as well as the State Department and National Security Council. At some point in the process — Mr. Petraeus told lawmakers he was not sure where — objections were raised to naming the groups, and the less specific word “extremists” was substituted. ||||| Former CIA Director David Petraeus testified Friday that the CIA believes the Benghazi attacks were conducted by terrorists, not a spontaneous demonstration, according to lawmakers who provided accounts of the closed hearing before Congress. Appearing on Capitol Hill for the first time since the scandal that ended his career at the intelligence agency, Petraeus tried to explain the discrepancy in Obama administration officials’ initial public statements about the cause of the attacks. Text Size - + reset King: Petraeus believes 'clear terrorist involvement' King: Petraeus scandal made questioning 'tough,' awkward Ruppersberger defends first Benghazi report, Petraeus (PHOTOS: General David Petraeus' career) “Now, he clearly believes that it did not arise out of a demonstration,” said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) “It was not spontaneous, and [there was] clear terrorist involvement.” Petraeus discussed early on his affair with Paula Broadwell, according to lawmakers. He said the controversy over what happened in Benghazi is a matter completely separate from the dalliance that caused him to resign. He also said he regretted the circumstances of his resignation, according to lawmakers. “We made clear at the start that that would not be the focus of his questioning,” said King. “I would say 10 seconds into it, that was off to the side.” (Also on POLITICO: No perfect choice to replace Petraeus) King also said the original talking points put out by the CIA to explain the attack differed from the final version of the story. “The original talking points were much more specific about Al Qaeda involvement,” King said, later adding that Petraeus didn’t know why the references to Al Qaeda were removed from the final version. Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) said the confusion over terrorist attacks vs. demonstrations at Benghazi might be chalked up to the difference between classified and unclassified talking points. “There may have been confusion with the unclassified talking points. … Perhaps there’s greater clarity in the classified talking points,” Langevin told reporters. “There were perhaps some subtleties that were used that may have been understood by some to mean one thing, where others may have had a different understanding of words — for example, ‘extremist’ versus ‘terrorist.’” Petraeus told lawmakers the CIA believed it to be a terrorist attack from the beginning, King said. “I told him in my questions that I had a very different recollection of that,” said King , the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee. “The clear impression was given was that the overwhelming amount of evidence was that it rose out of a spontaneous demonstration and it was not a terrorist attack.” That account differed from that of Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), who said Petraeus “reinforced” the belief among CIA officials in the 24 hours after the attack that it was the result of the demonstration. “He clarified that after more information came in, that it was not a protest,” Ruppersberger told reporters. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), another Intellligence Committee member who heard from Petraeus, backed up Ruppersberger’s view of Petraeus’s testimony. ”It was clear that initially that he thought that this was spontaneous, that extremist groups or indivduals may have capitalized on this situation to attack the temporary facility,” Schiff said in a phone interview with POLITICO. ||||| WASHINGTON—Former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus said Friday that he told Congress from the earliest days that there was \\"significant terrorist involvement\\" in the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya—adding to the controversy over the administration's handling of the attack. Mr. Petraeus, who resigned last week after acknowledging an extramarital affair, went to Congress on Friday to defend his old agency's role in the response to the Benghazi, Libya, attack. In his closed-door testimony, he said that, in secret briefings with lawmakers soon after the attack, he had apprised them of the likely involvement of a local militant group, Ansar al-Sharia, said Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.), describing his comments. Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Rep. Peter King disputed how strongly ex-CIA chief Petraeus tied the Benghazi cousulate attack to terrorism. Those comments rekindled debate about the intelligence community's initial assessments that the attack was a terrorist strike, and whether the Obama administration resisted calling it a terrorist act for political reasons. The controversy also was extended when some lawmakers said they had a different recollection of Mr. Petraeus's earlier comments. Rep. King, who described Mr. Petraeus's Friday testimony, said his recollection of his earlier conversations was different. \\"He said today that, at the time, he was emphasizing the role of Ansar al-Sharia. But at the time, my recollection is that he was minimizing the role of Ansar al-Sharia,'' Mr. King told reporters, referring to a local militant group sympathetic to al Qaeda.

View Graphics Mr. Petraeus spoke behind closed doors Friday in long-awaited meetings with House and Senate intelligence committee members. The Libya attack claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Mr. Petraeus's Friday testimony, as outlined by lawmakers who were present, was generally consistent with how U.S. officials have described the shifting intelligence assessments of the consulate assault in interviews dating back to the days after it occurred. Still, his appearance and testimony this week by top U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials haven't blunted questions about the use of intelligence or about the administration's explanations. Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Former Central Intelligence Agency Director David Petraeus, shown in 2011 at a retirement tribute, met with lawmakers Friday to offer his assessment of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya. For instance, Mr. King and House Democrats clashed over whether Mr. Petraeus said Friday that there had been changes in CIA \\"talking points\\" designed to play down the role of terrorists. Republicans charge the Obama administration resisted conclusions that the assault was the product of a terrorist attack for more than a week so it could avoid explaining, during a heated presidential campaign, how militants with ties to al Qaeda struck a U.S. facility on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. CIA talking points used by the White House said the attack grew out of a protest against an anti-Islamic video. Top economist Alice Rivlin says the image of the U.S. will take a hammering if it's unable to avoid the fiscal cliff. WSJ reporters bring the latest on how close Congress is to a deal and assess the fallout of the scandal engulfing David Petraeus. A CIA analysis prepared the morning after the attack said that the attack appeared intentional and didn't appear to stem from a peaceful protest, according to a senior U.S. official. Analysis that day also mentioned the possibility of connections to an al Qaeda affiliate. However, that information about specific groups involved came from classified sources the subject of debate among intelligence officials, so it was left out of unclassified talking points. The CIA began receiving new information Sept. 15 that cast doubt about the protest, but the assessment wasn't immediately changed. On Sept. 16, United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice in a series of television interviews cited the official assessment as outlined in talking points. The CIA maintained its assessment until Sept. 20, when intelligence officials told counterparts at the White House that it had changed, according to senior U.S. officials The talking points used by Ms. Rice were developed by the CIA from the classified reports, in response to a request from Congress, U.S. officials have said. While the early classified reports mentioned the possible involvement of Ansar al-Sharia, the talking points developed for public use didn't. WSJ reporters in Washington discuss the week's two big stories: the negotiations to find a deficit deal to avoid the looming fiscal cliff and the David Petraeus scandal that has engulfed the American intelligence community. Mr. King said Congress needed to do more probing to try to determine who specifically decided to alter the references to terrorists in the earlier draft. However, a senior U.S. official familiar with the drafting of the talking points said the name of specific groups and their ties with al Qaeda were omitted in part because that information came from classified sources that needed to be protected. The intelligence linking the militant groups also were \\"tenuous,\\" the official said. \\"The points were reviewed by CIA leadership and coordinated in the interagency at a senior level,\\" the official said, referring to the process by which the government's various intelligence agencies coordinate their findings. \\"The points were not, as has been insinuated by some, edited to minimize the role of extremists, diminish terrorist affiliations or play down that this was an attack.\\" The official said the talking points contained the word \\"extremists,\\" which was intended to convey the presence of militants or possible terrorists, and Ms. Rice used the term extremists in television appearances. Republicans have criticized the administration's refusal to refer to the specific involvement of terrorists, rather than extremists. \\"The controversy this word choice caused came as a surprise,\\" the official said. Mr. Petraeus's appearance Friday took on its own cloak-and-dagger feel, as the former CIA director navigated his way to the hearings through underground tunnels to avoid being mobbed by reporters. He hasn't made a public appearance since resigning after acknowledging an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. Democrats said the discussions with Mr. Petraeus made clear there had been no political interference with intelligence reports or talking points. \\"He thoroughly debunked the idea that there was some White House tinting or shading to this,\\" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), a member of the House intelligence panel. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said questions remained to be answered about the talking points used by Ms. Rice. He said he realized the Sept. 11 assault was an act of terrorism from the start. \\"There was no question in the mind of anybody that this was an act of terrorism from the get-go,\\" Sen. Chambliss said. Many lawmakers praised Mr. Petraeus, a retired Army general who resigned in the wake of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that uncovered his extramarital affair. Lawmakers said Mr. Petraeus told them the probe hadn't influenced his statements or the inquiry into the consulate attack.

Problem:There are three major apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms. Although APOE-epsilon3 is considered a longevity gene, APOE-epsilon4 is a dual risk factor to atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease. We have expressed full-length and N- and C-terminal truncated apoE3 and apoE4 tailored to eliminate helix and domain interactions to unveil structural and functional disturbances. The N-terminal truncated apoE4-(72-299) and C-terminal truncated apoE4-(1-231) showed more complicated or aggregated species than those of the corresponding apoE3 counterparts. This isoformic structural variation did not exist in the presence of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine. The C-terminal truncated apoE-(1-191) and apoE-(1-231) proteins greatly lost lipid binding ability as illustrated by the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine turbidity clearance. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor binding ability, determined by a competition binding assay of 3H-LDL to the LDL receptor of HepG2 cells, showed that apoE4 proteins with N-terminal (apoE4-(72-299)), C-terminal (apoE4-(1-231)), or complete C-terminal truncation (apoE4-(1-191)) maintained greater receptor binding abilities than their apoE3 counterparts.

Article: There’s nothing wrong with going to a party or hanging out with friends, as long as you don’t feel forced into it. Don’t succumb to peer pressure because you want to fit in or be cool. Before you start trying to balance your social life with your academics, make sure the things that comprise your social life are activities you actually want to take part in. Focus on things that bring you enjoyment and a welcome distraction from your schoolwork. Try some new activities. For example, you could try signing up for a Zumba class, or take a watercolor painting class. You can try new activities with friends or on your own. Make sure the people you allow in your life are supportive of your academic goals. If they make you feel guilty for not hanging out with them, they’re not being supportive of what you’re trying to achieve. Talk to them about your goals, focusing on finding a middle ground between the involvement they expect of you and your academic schedule. If they seem more focused on getting what they want and not helping you achieve your goals, you might have to start asking yourself if they’re a real friend. Try out some new activities to meet people who share your interests and who may also make supportive friends. You might find that some of the clubs and organizations in your school have the kinds of activities you want to participate in. Joining a school club gives you the ability to spend time with like-minded students, building relationships that can help you during your academic career as well as giving you a needed social break. Additionally, since club activities often follow a fixed schedule, it’ll be easier to fit them in around the schedule you’ve set for your schoolwork. If you want to stay in good health, you might want to join a sports team or a fitness-focused club. Clubs centered around artistic pursuits, such as sculpture or painting, can help you diversify your skillset while expressing yourself. Clubs focusing on math and the sciences can help you improve your skills in a way that’s directly useful for your schoolwork. Keep in mind that you can always start a club of your own if you can’t find a club that you want to join. While a teacher can help you with your schoolwork, a guidance counselor or academic advisor can help you with the overall balancing of your schoolwork and social life. They can serve as a good reference point for any questions you may have. Don’t hesitate to turn to them for help with all aspects of your academic and social life: Guidance counselors are usually trained to help you set academic goals, study more efficiently as well as helping you resolve conflicts with family and friends. Some guidance counselors also provide therapy and counseling services that can prove helpful as you straighten out your social life.

What is the answer to this question? who won the battle of the bulge in world war 2?","completion":"To answer this question, I will perform the following steps: 1. Understand the context: The Battle of the Bulge took place during World War II. 2. Research historical records: To find out who won the battle, I will need to look for credible historical sources. 3. Summarize the findings: Based on my research, I will determine the winner and present the answer. Step 1: The context is clear: the Battle of the Bulge occurred during World War II. It was an important conflict between Axis and Allied forces. Step 2: Consulting historical records, I find that the Battle of the Bulge took place from December 16, 1944, to January 25, 1945. It was a major German offensive campaign on the Western Front, where Adolf Hitler's forces sought to break through the Allied lines and recapture the key port of Antwerp. The battle was known for its intense combat and harsh winter conditions, making it one of the bloodiest fights of the war. Step 3: Based on the information found in step 2, it is clear that the winner of the Battle of the Bulge was the Allied forces. They managed to push back the German advance and ultimately closed the bulge, preventing Hitler's forces from achieving their objectives. This victory reinforced the Allied position on the Western Front and set the stage for their eventual push into Germany."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Nigel was more prone to viral infections, so one day he got infected with the HIV virus. Manny had contracted some sort of bacterial infection. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend received more antiretroviral drugs? Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nigel received more antiretroviral drugs. This is because he was infected with the HIV virus, and antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy or ART) are specifically used to treat and manage HIV and AIDS. These drugs work to stop the virus from replicating and to reduce the viral load in the body, which helps to slow down the progression of the disease. On the other hand, Manny had a bacterial infection, which would not be treated with antiretroviral drugs. Instead, bacterial infections are typically treated with antibiotics, which target and eliminate bacteria in the body.

Analyze your options: (A) Buy women's clothes - This may be relevant if Jan wears women's clothes and Austin wants to mimic her style, but there is no information about clothing preferences in the context. (B) Encourage Austin - This seems like a generic statement and doesn't specifically address how Austin can be more like Jan. (C) Cut his hair - This might be relevant if Jan has short hair and Austin wants to copy her hairstyle, but there is no information about hair in the context. 5.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur. Question: suppose the fire burns out quickly because it lacks fuel happens, how will it affect a greater negative effect on the animals. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"Suppose the fire burns out quickly because it lacks fuel, the negative effect on the animals will likely be less severe compared to a longer-lasting, more destructive fire. The quick burnout implies that the fire will consume less vegetation and thus, potentially leave some areas of the habitat less affected. In turn, this might provide the animals some refuge within their original habitat. Regarding the second effect mentioned - \\"The survivors must find a new habitat\\" - the perturbation of the fire burning out quickly will likely lead to a less severe impact. When the fire consumes lesser vegetation and spreads less widely due to lack of fuel, it provides the possibility that the habitat may not be entirely destroyed. Consequently, if more parts of the habitat remain undamaged, the survivors may not need to search as intensively for a completely new habitat. This lessened effect on animals needing to find a new habitat can also mitigate the risk of conflict with other animals. As they may establish themselves in undamaged areas of their original habitat, the need to contend with other species in foreign territories will be minimized. Thus, the overall negative impact of the fire on the animals would be reduced. In conclusion, the quick burnout of the fire due to lack of fuel will likely have a less severe effect on the animals, making it less necessary for them to find a new habitat, and reducing potential conflicts with other animals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

The premise provided states that \\"A balding professor giving a lecture to students on the topic of 'opportunity'.\\" Considering the hypothesis given, \\"A professor with no hair giving a lecture to students,\\" we can analyze the similarities and differences between the two statements to determine their correlation. First, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis into their core elements: Premise: - Balding professor - Giving a lecture - Lecture topic: \\"opportunity\\" - Students are the audience Hypothesis: - Professor with no hair - Giving a lecture - Students are the audience We can observe certain similarities between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. In both statements, a professor is giving a lecture. This highlights a common action taking place in both scenarios. 2. Both statements involve an audience composed of students. This connection demonstrates that the context is the same in both the premise and hypothesis - a learning environment. Now, let's take a closer look at the key difference between the premise and the hypothesis: 1. The premise describes a \\"balding\\" professor, while the hypothesis refers to a \\"professor with no hair.\\" Both descriptions imply some extent of hair loss; however, the premise's description of the professor as \\"balding\\" indicates that the process of losing hair is ongoing. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the professor has already lost all their hair. Given the similarities and the key difference outlined above, one could argue that the premise supports the hypothesis to some extent, as both statements involve a professor who is experiencing hair loss. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the premise's description of the professor as \\"balding\\" indicates an ongoing process, whereas the hypothesis refers to a \\"professor with no hair.\\" Despite this distinction, the premise still tells us that the hypothesis is most likely true due to the overlap in context, action, and audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer.

I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me.

BRUSSELS — All but two European Union countries agreed Monday to new and tougher measures to enforce budget discipline in the euro zone, but the bloc still showed few signs of producing a comprehensive solution for the sovereign debt crisis or a credible plan to revive fragile economies across Europe’s weakened Mediterranean tier. The meeting of 27 European Union heads of state and government here in Brussels was aimed at completing the text of a so-called fiscal compact for the 17 nations relying on or intending to join the euro zone — with only Britain and the Czech Republic opting not to adopt the measures. After a meeting lasting seven hours, the leaders also issued a declaration calling for a new push to restart growth and combat joblessness across the Continent. But a number of politicians and analysts said the pledge by the European leaders to create new jobs was mostly empty, and others complained that the proposed rules to keep deficits under control contained little to actually help nations with high borrowing costs. The summit declaration also skirted the continuing problems in Greece, where a second bailout is being held up by the inability of the government in Athens to complete a deal with private holders of Greek bonds over the losses they should accept. Until Athens and its private-sector creditors can agree on a 132 billion writedown on Greek government debt, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union are not prepared to sign off on a further bailout. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said the Greek situation would not be addressed until after representatives of Greece’s so-called troika of creditors — the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank — report back on their investigation into what will be needed for Greece to manage its finances on its own. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, told a news conference at the end of the summit that there would be a “definitive agreement” on the private sector’s involvement in reducing Greek debt in coming days. After Monday night’s summit meeting, informal talks continued between the Greek prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and European officials. Despite the various other problems to deal with, an agreement on the fiscal compact could clear the way for Germany to accept stronger efforts by the European Central Bank to support ailing countries and a more comprehensive bailout fund aimed at protecting Italy and Spain against the risk of default. “It is an important step forward to a stability union,” Mrs. Merkel told reporters. “For those looking at the union and the euro from the outside, it is a very important to show this commitment.” Britain, which clashed openly with France and Germany last month over the pact, did not give any ground Monday and was joined by the Czech Republic, which also elected to stay outside. “We are not signing this treaty,” David Cameron, the British prime minister, said. “We are not ratifying it. And it places no obligations” on the United Kingdom, he said. He added: “Our national interest is that these countries get on and sort out the mess that is the euro.” Mr. Sarkozy sounded philosophical about the Britons’ intransigence. “There are different degrees of integration and everyone is free to choose where they stand,” he said. While European leaders agreed to bring a permanent bailout fund into existence earlier than previously foreseen, they postponed any final decisions on its ultimate size and how it will be financed. The International Monetary Fund has been pressing Europe to commit enough money to provide a credible backstop that would insure that Italy and Spain could pay their bills and continue to finance their debts. Germany backed away from a suggestion that it wanted the government in Athens to cede temporarily control over tax and spending decisions to a new, all-powerful, budget commissioner before it can secure further bailouts. Italy won its battle to restrict the scope of the fiscal compact, which calls for making it easier to impose sanctions against countries that break European Union budget rules. The text said the compact would make it harder to block sanctions against countries that exceed annual deficit targets but that the same tough system would not apply to nations with excessive overall debt, like Italy. The compact will come into force in those nations that agree to its terms once 12 euro zone nations have ratified it. That would prevent the project being held up if one or two nations hold referendums on the deal. Still, impatience with the German focus on belt-tightening loomed large over the summit meeting. “You don’t have to be an economics professor to know that if you have zero growth you are not going to sort things out,” said Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament. Critics of austerity point to Greece, which is being strangled by a vicious cycle of deficit cutting, declining tax revenues and more budget cutting, while making little if any progress on its overall budget deficit. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the centrist liberal and democrat group, and a former prime minister of Belgium, took a similar stand. “The new agreement consolidates fiscal discipline but omits completely to address the other side of the coin — that of solidarity and investment that will create jobs and growth,” Mr. Verhofstadt said. “E.U. leaders should act instead of producing more paper.” ||||| Media caption Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel says EU leaders have taken an \\"important step forward\\" Twenty-five of the EU's 27 member states have agreed to join a fiscal treaty to enforce budget discipline. The Czech Republic and the UK refused to sign up. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said his government would act if the treaty threatened UK interests. He still has \\"legal concerns\\" about the use of EU institutions in enforcing the fiscal treaty, he said. The Czechs cited \\"constitutional reasons\\" for their refusal, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy said. Czech President Vaclav Klaus, a Eurosceptic, may be reluctant to sign the treaty, analysts say. The goal is much closer co-ordination of budget policy across the EU to prevent excessive debts accumulating. Germany - the eurozone's biggest lender and most powerful economy - was particularly keen to get a binding treaty adopted to enforce budget rules. The treaty will empower the European Court of Justice to monitor compliance and impose fines on rule-breakers. The treaty also spells out the enhanced role of the European Commission in scrutinising national budgets. Media caption British PM David Cameron: \\"We will not be ratifying this treaty and it places no obligation on the UK\\" The Czech Republic is not yet in the euro, but like the other new EU member states it is committed to joining. European Union leaders also discussed ways to stimulate economic growth despite the stringent austerity budgets in many countries - and focused on how to reduce unemployment across the eurozone. UK concerns The UK and Denmark are the only states with explicit opt-outs from the euro. Mr Cameron said \\"it's good that the new treaty is absolutely explicit and clear that it cannot encroach on the competences of the EU\\". Analysis No-one believes that this treaty on its own will solve anything, and it could face an uncertain future. The Socialist candidate in the French presidential election Francois Hollande has promised to renegotiate it if he wins, and President Nicolas Sarkozy has now confirmed that the treaty will not be ratified in France before the election takes place. In fact given general agreement on the need for measures to promote growth, some critics have described the fiscal treaty as little more than a distraction. But Germany has pushed hard for its implementation - partly to persuade political opinion in Berlin that there really will be strict rules in place to ensure that another debt crisis can't happen in the future. Only then will Germany consider spending more money to help other countries which are struggling with their debts now. The fear is that if Germany doesn't act, the current crisis will only get worse. Q&A: Debt crisis deal What caused the crisis? \\"They must not take measures that in any way undermine the EU single market,\\" he said, adding: \\"we'll be watching like a hawk\\". He insisted that the treaty would impose \\"no obligations on the UK\\". Mr Cameron used his veto last month to opt out of the treaty, arguing that the UK needed to keep its authority over financial services in the City of London. The eurozone crisis dominated Monday's summit, with debt-laden Greece still at risk of defaulting. A general strike in Belgium, paralysing transport, reminded EU leaders of public discontent with austerity as they arrived for the summit. The talks also concentrated on reducing unemployment, which is averaging 10% across the eurozone, though youth unemployment is often much higher. There are fears that wide-ranging budget cuts will harm enterprise and training. The leaders discussed measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), many of which complain of excessive administrative costs imposed by Brussels. In a joint statement on economic growth they noted that cutting budget deficits was \\"not in itself sufficient\\". \\"We have to modernise our economies and strengthen our competitiveness to secure sustainable growth,\\" the statement said. The EU will help to fund schemes to get young people into work or training in member states with the highest youth unemployment levels. They pledged to speed up measures to develop the EU single market, including: agreement on a common EU patent system by July; better targeting of EU funds towards SMEs; national legislation to create a functioning single market in services and energy. The European Commission says 82bn euros (£69bn; 107bn) of EU money is available for countries to spend on projects to boost jobs and growth. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"European leaders met in Brussels and agreed on new measures to enforce better budget discipline in the euro zone.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Usage: How did Faith in the Earth and Thus Spoke Zarathustra progress Friedrich Nietzsche's own form of unique belief system? The question asks us to analyze the impact of two works by Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\\" on the development of his own unique belief system. Part #2: Identifying the works. Usage: \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" are two philosophical works by Friedrich Nietzsche. These works are important as they provide insights into his thoughts and beliefs. Part #3: Exploring Nietzsche's unique belief system. Usage: Nietzsche's belief system is known for its concepts of the Ubermensch (Superman), the will to power, and the eternal recurrence, among others. It is rooted in his criticism of traditional morality and religion, as well as his advocacy for individualism and self-overcoming. Part #4: Analyzing the impact of \\"Faith in the Earth\\" on Nietzsche's belief system. Usage: In \\"Faith in the Earth,\\" Nietzsche critiques traditional religious and metaphysical views, rejecting the idea of a transcendent God. This work contributes to his belief system by promoting a worldview that values the Earth and human experiences over a belief in a higher power. For instance, the text emphasizes the importance of embracing life and earthly experiences rather than seeking spiritual transcendence. Part #5: Analyzing the impact of \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" on Nietzsche's belief system. Usage: \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" is one of Nietzsche's most famous works and introduces the concept of the Ubermensch. It is an influential text in his belief system because it presents an ideal for humans to strive towards. It also showcases his ideas about the will to power and the eternal recurrence. For example, the titular character Zarathustra encourages individuals to overcome their limitations and create their own values, exemplifying Nietzsche’s emphasis on individualism and self-overcoming. In conclusion, both \\"Faith in the Earth\\" and \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" played significant roles in progressing Friedrich Nietzsche's unique belief system by critiquing traditional values, promoting individualism and self-overcoming, and introducing key concepts like the Ubermensch, the will to power, and the eternal recurrence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. But I can use this background: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. What is an answer for this question: Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's look at the information provided: 1.

Loki was hurt in a fall and decided to get a bandage but left out the alcohol because the","completion":"pain was unbearable. The wound, a deep gash and blood oozing all over his arm, needed immediate attention. The trickster god, known for his cunning and agility, knew the injury could end up being an obstacle to his future mischief if not treated correctly. As he searched for a bandage to wrap the nasty cut, he made another split decision based on his history of pain, endurance, and expertise in the healing arts. Loki knew the severity of the wound warranted both bandaging and proper disinfection. However, he could not bring himself to use alcohol, as he was afraid the excruciating pain from the stinging sensation would be too much for him to bear. This choice, born from both his trepidation and pride, could potentially lead to serious consequences. As Loki dressed his wound with the bandage, he thought about the various alternatives he could use to disinfect the wound that might be less agonizing than alcohol. His mind raced through the countless potions, elixirs, and salves he had witnessed his fellow gods using before in similar situations. A particular memory struck him. Once, when his brother Thor had been injured on the battlefield, a healer had applied a concoction of honey, lavender, and crushed rose petals to the wound. Loki remembered how the beautiful fragrance of the concoction filled the air, and how Thor had reported little to no pain during the healing process, with the wound ultimately healing successfully. Another option that came across his mind was the use of medicinal mushrooms. In particular, the chaga mushroom, found on birch trees, was known for its potent anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties. By making a poultice out of chaga and applying it to his wound, Loki knew that not only could he avoid the sting of alcohol but also harness the powerful healing properties of the mushroom. Loki weighed both options carefully, considering each one but unsure which one to choose. While the combination of honey, lavender, and rose petals seemed to be an effective and less painful method to heal Thor's wound, it heavily relied on anecdotal evidence. On the other hand, the chaga mushroom had been historically attributed to numerous successful healings and even documented scientific benefits. However, Loki felt that the efficacy of each remedy could be different from person to person, and he found himself hesitant to make a decision. Contemplating for a few more moments, Loki decided to combine both remedies, hoping the synergistic properties of the unique ingredients would create an effective treatment for his wound. So, he set out on a quest to gather the necessary ingredients: honey, lavender, rose petals, and chaga mushrooms. Once he had obtained them all, Loki lightly crushed the rose petals and mixed them with the honey and lavender. Then, he prepared the chaga poultice by grinding the mushrooms into a paste. He applied the poultice to the wound first, and then gently spread the honey-lavender-and-rose-petal mixture on top, sealing it with the bandage he had already acquired. While time would tell whether his unorthodox remedy would work, in the end, the combination of ingredients seemed to have a soothing effect, bringing one of the most elusive smiles to Loki's face. It was a smile of relief, of pride, and of anticipation as he looked forward to his swift recovery and scheming of new tricks. Hoping he had made a wise decision to not use alcohol on his wound, Loki couldn't help but imagine the adventures that awaited him once his body had fully healed, ready for a new beginning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most of us enjoyed reading a specific book or series of books as children. Re-read your favorite to feel like a kid again. For a more authentic and affordable experience, check out a book from the public library instead of ordering it online or shopping in a store. Re-create the times you stayed up late reading under the covers with a flashlight. While automobiles present a convenient way to get from point A to point B, they tend to make you feel more like a grown up. Instead, try riding a bike so you can remember how it felt to coast down a hill with the wind in your face. Don’t worry about heading to a specific destination. Most kids just enjoy riding for the fun of it. Research and rock out to a top 40 playlist from your youth. Dig out your old CDs, cassettes, 8-tracks, or vinyl to relive pleasure of music before the Internet. If you discarded all your old media, many Internet radio services already have playlists built around certain decades or years, so it shouldn’t be difficult to re-create the soundtrack of your childhood. Most children don’t have the inhibitions that adults do, so sing and dance the way you used to. As an adult, you probably agonize over what you eat, but as a kid, you likely had a favorite treat or food that was less than healthy. You don’t have to make a regular habit out of this, but enjoying some of these treats might help you feel like a kid again: Popsicles or ice cream. Pizza. Candy. A specific type of soda or fruit punch. Cotton candy. Recapture that youthful feeling and relive your glory days by visiting some of your childhood haunts. Here are a few locations to help get you started: Fairs, the circus, or amusement parks. Mini-golf courses. Arcades. Go-kart tracks. Water parks. Zoos. Toy stores. Skating rinks. Playgrounds. Kids play with a sense of abandon and don’t worry about making a mess. Put on clothes you don’t mind getting dirty, and splash around in puddles or make some mud pies. The pride of accomplishment that comes from climbing a tree and the sense of exhilaration that you feel when sitting up high will take you back to a simpler time. Remember, you’re probably bigger now than you were the last time you attempted this, and make sure you reach for sturdy branches. If you don’t care for heights, don’t despair. Try playing, reading, or enjoying a picnic below the tree. Choose what you want to wear without worrying about whether it matches perfectly or conveys the right message to your peers or colleagues. If you work in an environment with a strict dress code, it might be best to save this activity for your day off. If you are fortunate enough to live in an area with an ice-cream truck, take advantage of this opportunity usually reserved for kids. Ice-cream from the truck often tastes better than the kind you get at the store, and it can be hard to find some of these childhood treats anywhere else. Many people spend their childhoods swinging, sliding, and climbing a jungle gym at the playground. Visiting these places will remind you how it feels to play like a kid. If you’re feeling adventurous, try tackling the monkey bars. Much of this equipment is designed to hold the weight of children. Test it out carefully before using, because nothing makes you feel more like an adult than filling out emergency-room paperwork. Although you might not consider yourself an artistic person, spending a little time engaged in creative activities will help you relax. You don’t have to pick an elaborate craft or activity. Use modeling clay, a coloring book, or even paint by numbers for a simple but fun experience. Art projects make great rainy day activity. Think about some of the games you enjoyed as a child, and recruit some friends or family members to join you. Here are a few ideas to get you started: Hopscotch. Four square. Tag or capture the flag. Dodgeball. Hide-and-seek. Jumping rope. Board games. Team sports. When was the last time you just enjoyed being around your friends? Get your group together without a specific agenda, or enjoy some of the activities you used to love as kids. Organize a slumber party. Play video games. Watch scary movies. Play truth-or-dare.

In this film Li plays Tsui, an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him. To do this Tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. Other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as Tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace. Thus Tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. This film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. The martial arts is amazing, but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by American audiences. If you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts, then Black Mask is for you.

Please answer the following question: David got five exercise tips from his personal trainer, tip A, tip B, tip C, tip D, and tip E. Tip A involves weight lifting, but tip B does not involve weight lifting. Tip C involves running, but tip D does not involve running. Finally, tip E does not involve any exercise at all. David has to find out which tips are most useful for him. In which tip the skeletal muscle would not be bigger, tip A or tip B? A:","completion":"To determine which tip will not result in bigger skeletal muscles, we need to analyze the types of exercises involved in tips A and B. Step 1: Analyze tip A Tip A involves weight lifting, which is an anaerobic exercise. This type of exercise consists of short-duration, high-intensity activities that primarily involve resistance training. Weight lifting stimulates the growth of skeletal muscles by causing micro-tears in the muscle fibers, which the body repairs and rebuilds to be stronger and bigger. Step 2: Analyze tip B Tip B does not involve weight lifting, but we don't have specific information about what type of exercises it includes. Let's assume it consists of other exercises that are not focused on resistance training or muscle building. Step 3: Compare the given information Based on the information given, tip A (weight lifting) directly contributes to the growth of skeletal muscles due to the nature of resistance training. Tip B does not involve weight lifting, and the exercises included in this tip might not contribute to muscle growth as much as weight lifting does. Conclusion: Between tip A and tip B, the skeletal muscles would not be bigger in tip B, as it does not involve weight lifting, which is a primary exercise for muscle growth."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who dies aboard the Mayflower? ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In what year was the Rokeby Venus badly destroyed? ? The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","completion":"The Rokeby Venus was badly damaged in the year 1914.

Paragraph : Longer wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelength waves have higher frequencies. Question: John was testing a radio wave and had an interesting finding. The shorter the wavelength was, the frequency became Higher or Lower? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is Higher. In the given paragraph, it is stated that shorter wavelength electromagnetic waves have higher frequencies. In John's testing of a radio wave, he observed an interesting finding where the shorter the wavelength, the frequency became higher. This observation is consistent with the information provided in the paragraph. As the wavelength decreases, the frequency increases because wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional to each other. This inverse relationship can be represented by the equation: c = λf where \\"c\\" is the speed of light, \\"λ\\" (lambda) represents the wavelength, and \\"f\\" is the frequency of the wave. As the wavelength (λ) decreases, the frequency (f) must increase to maintain the equality. In the context of radio waves, these principles govern how different radio signals can be transmitted and received simultaneously without interfering with each other. With shorter wavelengths, the radio waves can have higher frequencies, which enable them to carry more information in a given period of time. This aspect is beneficial in modern communication systems such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and satellite communication, where large amounts of data need to be transmitted quickly. In summary, John's finding that the shorter the wavelength of radio waves, the higher the frequency is, aligns with the given information, and this relationship has practical applications in various aspects of wireless communication technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A boarding school pupil hanged herself in her bathroom at home after leaving a note that simply said: 'I'm sorry', an inquest heard today. Tragic Millicent Waddell, 16, locked herself in the bathroom of her mother's £400,000 home before taking her own life. Her horrified mum, Louisa-Kate Foster, discovered her body after breaking into the room when her daughter failed to respond to her knocking on the door. The inquest at Shepton Mallet, Somerset, heard Millie had become unhappy after moving from her father Robert Waddell's home in London to her mother's house in Somerset. But Tony Williams, coroner for East Somerset, said there was 'no prior indication' that the teenager would harm herself. Reading a statement from Millie's mother, who did not attend the inquest, Mr Williams said: 'Millicent had wanted to stay in London but things had not worked out and so Millicent came, in early April, to live with her mother. 'Millicent was in the process of deciding whether she wanted to go to college or find a job. 'She was angry with her situation. She wanted to stay in London but there was no indication that she might self harm in any way.' Millie attended Sexey's School in Bruton, Somerset, a Church of England state boarding school which charges up to £8,400 a year. Mrs Foster's statement told how she returned to their home in Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, at 5.40pm on the day of Millie's death, May 29 last year, but did not see her daughter. She later heard the shower running in the bathroom and knocked on the door at 7.20pm but did not receive a reply. The mother left home for a meeting and returned at 9.15pm - when she found the door still locked.Mr Williams added: 'She decided she would need to force the door.' Ms Foster forced her way into the room and found her daughter hanged, he told the court. 'A note was found at the property in Millicent's handwriting that simply read: \\"I'm sorry\\",' he added. Robert Waddell, Millie's father, provided a statement confirming there had been no concerns that she would harm herself before her death. Police attended the £400,000 detached home but could not save Millie. 'Unhappy': Millicent, known as Millie, attended Sexey's School, a Church of England boarding school in Bruton, Somerset. A toxicology report later showed she had 79mg of alcohol per 100ml - the maximum for driving is 80mg. No prescription or illegal drugs were found in her system, the inquest heard. Pathologist Dr Robert Blahut, at Yeovil District Hospital, confirmed the cause of Millie's death as hanging. Mr Williams told the inquest at East Somerset Coroner's Court: 'There is no evidence to suggest third party involvement. 'I take into account the note that was left by Millicent with two words explaining her actions. 'Millicent knew while she was in the family home she would not be disturbed while she was in the bathroom. My formal finding is that Millicent took her own life.'

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available choices: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"b). yes; Both of these questions are essentially asking the same thing, which is how to get unblocked by someone who has blocked them. They are paraphrased versions of the same question. The first question is more general, while the second question specifically mentions WhatsApp as the platform where the block has taken place. Regardless, they both address the concern of getting unblocked by another person. Now, I will provide a detailed answer to this concern: When someone blocks you on a platform such as WhatsApp, your connection with them becomes limited, and you lose the ability to interact with them through that application. There are several reasons why someone might block you, such as privacy concerns, personal conflicts, or a simple misunderstanding. Regardless of the reason, you may want to reestablish contact with them. Unblocking yourself from someone who blocked you is not possible through the normal features provided by messaging platforms like WhatsApp. This is due to their commitment to users' privacy and security. However, you can try the following steps to rebuild the connection and potentially get unblocked: 1. Reflect on the reason for the block: Consider the context surrounding the block and try to identify any potential causes that led to this action. If you have wronged the person or made them uncomfortable, you must acknowledge your mistakes before working on rebuilding the connection. 2. Contact them through another platform: If you have other ways to contact the person, such as via email, social media, or phone calls, you can try to reach out to them via those alternate channels. Politely request them to unblock you and explain your situation. 3. Apologize if necessary: If you have wronged the person in any way, be sure to sincerely apologize. Acknowledge your mistakes and express your desire to make amends. This display of genuine remorse may prompt the person to reconsider their decision to block you. 4. Request mutual friends to intervene: If you share mutual friends with the person who blocked you, ask them to mediate the situation. They might be willing to talk to the person on your behalf and help convey your intentions to reconnect. 5. Give them space: Sometimes, the best course of action is to give the person some time and space to process their emotions. After a while, they might unblock you voluntarily if they feel comfortable doing so. 6. Make a new account: Though not a recommended or ethical approach, you could create a new account and try contacting the person from there. However, be cautious, as this may lead to further issues if the person isn't ready to reestablish contact, and it violates the terms of service of many platforms.

The answer to the question: Who is stabbed by Alexia? is inside the article: The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of annihilation by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat. Selene deliberately slides herself under the now broken ice of the lake, telling herself that this is the 'path'., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Selene, a vampire character in the underworld series, is stabbed by Alexia, another vampire dispatched by Semira from the Eastern Coven.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Emiliano Zapata Salazar (Spanish pronunciation: [emi'ljano sa'pata]; 8 August 1879 - 10 April 1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution, the main leader of the peasant revolution in the state of Morelos, and the inspiration of the agrarian movement called Zapatismo. Zapata was born in the rural village of Anenecuilco in Morelos State, where peasant communities were under increasing pressure from the small landowning class who monopolized land and water resources for sugar cane production with the support of dictator Porfirio Diaz. Zapata early on participated in political movements against Diaz and the landowning hacendados, and when the Revolution broke out in 1910 he was positioned as a central leader of the peasant revolt in Morelos. Cooperating with a number of other peasant leaders he formed the Liberation Army of the South of which he soon became the undisputed leader. Meanwhile, the disintegration of the revolution outside of Morelos put pressure on the Zapatistas. As General Arenas had turned over to the constitutionalists, he had secured peace for his region and he remained in control there. This suggested to many revolutionaries that perhaps the time had come to seek a peaceful conclusion to the struggle. A movement within the Zapatista ranks led by former General Vazquez and Zapata's erstwhile adviser and inspiration Otilio Montano moved against the Tlaltizapan headquarters demanding surrender to the Carrancistas. Reluctantly, Zapata had Montano tried for treason and executed (Womack 1983-86). Zapata began looking for allies among the northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas, followers of the Liberalist Felix Diaz. He sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the Americans and other possible sources of support. In the fall of 1917 a force led by Gonzalez and the ex-Zapatista Sidronio Camacho, who had killed Zapata's brother Eufemio, moved into the eastern part of Morelos taking Cuautla, Zacualpan and Jonacatepec. Zapata continued his work to try to unite with the national anti-Carrancista movement through the next year, and the constitutionalists did not make further advances. In the winter of 1918 a harsh cold and the onset of the Spanish flu decimated the population of Morelos, causing the loss of a quarter of the total population of the state, almost as many as had been lost to Huerta in 1914. (Womack 311). Furthermore, Zapata began to worry that by the end of the World War, the US would turn its attention to Mexico forcing the Zapatistas to either join the Carrancistas in a national defense or to acquiesce to foreign domination of Mexico. In December 1918 Carrancistas under Gonzalez undertook an offensive campaign taking most of the state of Morelos, and pushing Zapata to retreat. The main Zapatista headquarters were moved to Tochimilco, Puebla, although Tlaltizapan also continued to be under Zapatista control. Through Castro, Carranza issued offers to the main Zapatista generals to join the nationalist cause, with pardon. But apart from Manuel Palafox, who having fallen in disgrace among the Zapatistas had joined the Arenistas, none of the major generals did (Womack 313-14). Zapata emitted statements accusing Carranza of being secretly sympathetic to the Germans (Womack 315). In March Zapata finally emitted an open letter to Carranza urging him for the good of the fatherland to resign his leadership to Vazquez Gomez, by now the rallying point of the anti-constitutionalist movement (Womack 319-20). Having posed this formidable moral challenge to Carranza prior to the upcoming 1920 presidential elections, the Zapatista generals at Tochimilco, Magana and Ayaquica, urged Zapata not to take any risks and to lay low. But Zapata declined, considering that the respect of his troops depended on his active presence at the front (Womack 320-22). How did he handle the pressure beyond this? What were his plans?","completion":"As the pressure continued to mount on Emiliano Zapata and the Zapatistas, he sought ways to strengthen his forces and continue resisting the Carrancistas. Though detailed plans of Zapata's strategies during this period are not readily available, it can be inferred from historical records that he took the following steps to handle the pressure and advance his cause: 1. Forming Alliances: Zapata actively sought alliances with other revolutionary factions and anti-Carrancista groups. He had already attempted to forge alliances with northern revolutionaries and the southern Felicistas. This would have expanded his support base, increasing the resources and manpower available to the Zapatistas. 2. Engaging with the Americans: Zapata sent Gildardo Magana as an envoy to communicate with the United States and explore possible support. By reaching out to the Americans, he attempted to gather international backing for his cause and weaken Carranza's position. 3. Guerilla Tactics: As the situation grew more difficult due to the loss of territory and setbacks, the Zapatistas likely relied on guerilla warfare tactics. These tactics would allow them to carry out swift attacks, confuse the enemy, and minimize open confrontation with the more powerful Carrancistas. 4. Inspiring and Maintaining Morale: Zapata understood the importance of his leadership role in maintaining the morale and loyalty of his troops, as evidenced by his refusal to hide or take a step back. By remaining visible, active, and engaged on the front lines, he kept his troops motivated and focused. 5. Challenging Carranza Morally: Zapata continued to challenge the legitimacy of Carranza's leadership on moral grounds, such as accusing him of sympathizing with the Germans and urging him to resign in an open letter. This strategy aimed to undermine Carranza's credibility and win over more supporters to Zapata's cause, particularly in light of the upcoming 1920 presidential elections. In conclusion, Zapata aimed to face the mounting pressure by expanding his support base, seeking international backing, employing guerilla warfare tactics, maintaining troop morale, and challenging the legitimacy of Carranza's rule. Together, these strategies would have helped him to persevere in his struggle against the Carrancistas and fight for the causes he believed in, such as land and social reform for the benefit of peasants and marginalized communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is it true that can you hold dual citizenship in new zealand based on the following text? New Zealand has permitted dual or multiple citizenship since the creation of New Zealand citizenship on 1 January 1949, although dual citizens who actively acquired or exercised their other citizenship could lose their New Zealand citizenship if their continued citizenship was judged \`\`not conducive to the public good''. The modern wording is similar; dual citizens may lose New Zealand citizenship by acting \`\`in a manner that is contrary to the interests of New Zealand''. A New Zealand citizen who holds another citizenship may renounce their New Zealand citizenship (see below), although this may not be registered if they reside in New Zealand or the country is at war.","completion":"Based on the provided text, it is true that you can hold dual citizenship in New Zealand. I will justify this conclusion using the information provided in the text: 1. The text states that \\"New Zealand has permitted dual or multiple citizenship since the creation of New Zealand citizenship on 1 January 1949.\\" This statement clearly implies that dual citizenship is allowed in New Zealand. 2. The text further explains that dual citizens may lose their New Zealand citizenship if their actions are not conducive to the public good or are contrary to the interests of New Zealand. However, this clause does not negate the fact that dual citizenship is permitted; it only clarifies the conditions under which someone might lose their New Zealand citizenship. 3. Lastly, the text mentions that a New Zealand citizen who holds another citizenship may renounce their New Zealand citizenship, subject to certain conditions. This statement also confirms the possibility of holding dual citizenship, as it implies that an individual can be a citizen of New Zealand and another country simultaneously.

Q:Given the following context: Defense lawyer Stephen Ashe successfully defends known gangster Ace Wilfong from a murder charge, despite his knowledge of Ace's other illegal activities. His upper-class family has all but disowned him and his daughter Jan, due to Stephen's alcoholism and Jan's free spirited willfulness. Jan is engaged to clean-cut Dwight Winthrop, but their relationship is threatened when she meets Ace and becomes enamored with him and his exciting life. As Stephen continues to slip deeper into alcoholism, Jan breaks her engagement with Dwight and begins a clandestine affair with Ace, which grows into love. This comes to a head when Ace asks a drunken Stephen if he can marry Jan; Stephen, offended by the request, angrily refuses, and when he discovers Jan in Ace's boudoir, takes her home. They have an argument over their respective vices, and Jan proposes a deal: she will never see Ace again if Stephen will give up drinking. Despite knowing he cannot keep his promise, Stephen agrees, and the two of them leave for a cleansing camping holiday, along with Stephen's fiercely loyal assistant Eddie. After three months of sobriety, Stephen buys a bottle of liquor and boards a train for an unknown destination. Jan returns home to find her family has cut her off; feeling despondent, she visits Ace. He reacts angrily and possessively to her return and informs her that they will be married the next day. Jan slowly realizes what sort of man he really is, and sneaks away. Ace follows her to her apartment and, after a brief confrontation involving Eddie and Dwight, threatens Jan that she cannot get out of marrying him, and that if she marries Dwight he (Ace) will make sure Dwight is killed. answer the following question: Whose assistant joins Jan's ex-fiance to confront a gangster?

Context: The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jít (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodívat (to go regularly). A:","completion":"The imperfective verbs are derived from the verbs in context by either a removal of a prefix or by changing the infinitive ending.

The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine. Almost all ingested food, 80 percent of electrolytes, and 90 percent of water are absorbed in the small intestine. Although the entire small intestine is involved in the absorption of water and lipids, most absorption of carbohydrates and proteins occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes from the ileum into the large intestine, it is essentially indigestible food residue (mainly plant fibers like cellulose), some water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32).

Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction. Answer:","completion":"The opposite of externally in the context provided is \\"internally.\\" The context discusses Mill's position on mathematics as a species of inductive inference and highlights that mathematical science operates through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures rather than relying on external sensory experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That meant we needed to find a place to board him close by and in a hurry. The Furshire seemed like the perfect place. Every time I called my call was received by friendly, enthusiastic staff. Being that we are from out of state and our dog isn't used to the hot weather in Arizona, my husband was worried it might be too warm for our pooch. We insisted on a tour before completing paperwork, just in case we didn't feel comfortable. We were given whirlwind tour and felt that our dog would be comfortable. All the other dogs there, either boarders or day care drop-offs, all seemed happy. When we saw the pool we thought this was without a doubt a great place. We completed the tour, signed off on the paperwork and were on our way. We only left our dog for two nights, dropping him off on Thursday afternoon and picking him up early Saturday morning. We received pictures of him playing with other dogs in the pool and felt at ease. When we picked him up, the employee who greeted us and brought him out was friendly enough and let us know that he had been a good boy, had really enjoyed the pool and been a quiet dog. The last part of her statement worried me a bit as he is a quiet dog at home, but not so much when we aren't with him. When she brought him out he was thrilled to see us and gave us as enthusiastic a greeting as he could. I was given the bag containing his food and immediately noticed that out of the five servings we had provided for his feeding, three were being returned. When we got him in the car and headed off down the road I started to get really worried. His tongue was darker than usual and he wouldn't stop panting. He also had a scrape on his nose. I asked my husband to pull over so that we could walk him, just in case having to \\"go\\" was the problem. It wasn't. I then gave him water (about a cup) which he immediately drank up.

Article: Story highlights Victims identified Suspect believed to be in abandoned building The man is also believed to have blown up his house, source says Schools and a hospital were in lockdown A man suspected of killing four people and injuring two others in a 10-minute shooting spree in Herkimer County, New York, is believed to be surrounded by police, authorities said Wednesday. The upstate New York man also is believed to have blown up his house, according to a federal law enforcement source briefed on the investigation. Policing searching for Kurt R. Myers, 64, surrounded an abandoned building, State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Myers ditched his vehicle following shootings at a barber shop and an auto maintenance business, police said. Officials provided no possible motive. Schools and a hospital in the Mohawk Valley area, about 70 miles west-northwest of Albany, went into lockdown while police searched for the suspect. Police first received a report of a fire at a residence at 9:29 a.m., D'Amico said. The call was followed minutes later with reports of shootings at John's Barber Shop in Mohawk and Gaffey's Fast Lube in Herkimer, authorities said. Myers allegedly spoke with individuals at the barber shop before firing multiple rounds, D'Amico said. Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Rancier, 57, were pronounced dead at the scene. Two other people were in critical condition at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Utica. Gaffey's employee Thomas Stefka and Michael Renshaw, a 20-year veteran of the State Department of Corrections, were killed at the auto business. Police believe Myers drove away from the auto shop and left his vehicle outside an abandoned building in Herkimer before shooting at officers, D'Amico said. No officers were injured during the shootout. Cuomo said he came to Herkimer to make sure the state was providing as many resources as possible. \\"This is truly an inexplicable situation; there was no apparent, rational motive to the best of our knowledge ... to provoke these attacks,\\" Cuomo said. \\"These are the types of peaceful, quiet communities that one would say 'this could never happen here,'\\" he said, referring to Mohawk and Herkimer. \\"We're concerned about officer safety, so we're in no rush to bring this to a conclusion; we want to make sure no one else gets injured today,\\" D'Amico said. A 1973 drunken driving arrest is the only past incident on Myers' record, D'Amico told the media. Reporters on Wednesday pressed Cuomo about New York's new gun-control laws, which were the first in the nation to be enacted after the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre. The laws fortified New York's existing assault weapons ban, limited the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthened rules that govern the mentally ill, which included a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. Cuomo said he would discuss the laws later. \\"Gun violence has been with us for a long, long time,\\" the governor said. \\"I think the challenge for government, the challenge for society, is to do the best that it can.\\" ||||| Authorities in upstate New York say the suspected gunman in a rampage at a car wash and a barbershop that left four people dead has been killed by police in a shootout.

(Associated Press) They say 64-year-old Kurt Myers was killed Thursday by police who had surrounded a block of small businesses in the village of Herkimer since Wednesday afternoon. Trooper Jack Keller says police went into the building around 8 a.m. He says the shootout occurred in the basement, where Myers shot a police dog. Keller says police returned fire, killing him. Myers' rampage started with a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk on Wednesday morning. They say he then shot two people dead and wounded two others at a barbershop around the corner before killing two more at a Herkimer oil change and car wash business. Hours later, a flurry of gunfire was heard near where police had narrowed their search. A college and schools were locked down, and people told to stay inside as police hunted Myers. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. A 64-year-old loner sauntered into a barbershop in upstate New York, coolly asked if the man cutting hair remembered him and then opened fire with a shotgun, the first shots in a burst of violence that would leave four dead, two critically wounded and people in this small village aching to find out what set the gunman off. New York state police vowed to wait out Kurt Myers, the man suspected of gunning down the victims then holing up in an abandoned building. Police kept vigilant watch there Thursday morning, periodically blaring sirens in an apparent attempt to encourage Myers to surrender, if alive. Booms also were heard. Police said Thursday they are confident he is still in the building, but don't know if he's dead or alive. John Seymour, one of the men wounded in the attacks told his sister, Mary Hornett, the barbershop attack came out of nowhere. \\"He just said that the guys were in the barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, \`Hi John, do you remember me?' and my brother said, \`Yes, Kurt, how are you?' and then he just started shooting,\\" Hornett said. Hornett said her brother, who was hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in the left hand and right hip. \\"My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,\\" she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a couple of years. Officers were fired on from the abandoned building on Wednesday afternoon while looking for Myers, state police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said. At least one officer returned fire. \\"We're in no rush to bring this to a conclusion,\\" D'Amico said, adding that the main objective was to make sure no one else was hurt. The shootings shattered the peace and rattled the nerves of Mohawk and Herkimer, two small villages about 170 miles northwest of New York City, separated from each other by the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway. Police snipers waited on rooftops on a block of small businesses in Herkimer as they waited for Myers to emerge. Police said Myers' rampage started with a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk at about 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. He then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, D'Amico said, identifying them as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer. In addition to Seymour, the shop's owner, another customer, Dan Haslauer, also was listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital. The gunman then drove to Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Michael Renshaw and Thomas Stefka. Renshaw was a 23-year employee of the state corrections department who worked at Mid-State Correctional Facility near Utica. Stefka worked at Gaffey's and attended Mohawk Reform Church, where he played guitar during services. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a press conference in Herkimer, called it \\"truly an inexplicable situation.\\" \\"There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,\\" he said. Police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest, D'Amico said. Police were positioned in front of a block of small businesses topped with apartments in the village of Herkimer on Wednesday evening. A local businessman, jeweler Fred Weisser, said police were trying to get people out while Myers was believed to be in a building next door. \\"They're sending in a robot to check the place out,\\" he said by telephone. \\"I guess we're stuck. We're between him and the cops. I don't want to step out and get clipped by a sniper.\\" Myles Smith, who lives in one of the apartments above the shops, said by cellphone he had heard police trying to talk to Myers. \\"The snipers on the roof are sitting there,\\" Smith said. \\"I ain't seen a whole lot of movement. I heard about five gunshots. I keep hearing them trying to talk him out, but I don't think he's coming out.\\" The rear of the small building where Myers lived was burned out, and police continued to guard the building, where they found guns and ammunition. It was unclear if they were in his apartment. Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, left every morning in his red Jeep and came back. Traci Randall said the only time she remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep. \\"He would walk by himself. He was kind of a loner. No wife,\\" she said. Neighbors said he never had visitors or friends. Gary Urich said Myers wouldn't even say much as \`Hi' to him when walking by his porch. \\"I said, \`How are you doing?' No response. He just walked by,\\" he said. Michele Mlinar, a bartender at Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until police released his mug shot on Wednesday. Cangee's owner Candy Rellin called Myers \\"just an odd little man.\\" The two villages are about 65 miles east of Syracuse on opposite sides of the Mohawk River _ which connects the Erie Canal to the Hudson River and from there, the sea _ in a region known as the Mohawk Valley. James Baron, the mayor of Mohawk described his village as close-knit and friendly, \\"the kind of place where you'd say, \`Oh, it would never happen here.'\\" Elizabeth Cirelli was shocked by Stefka's slaying. He was a neighbor in Herkimer. \\"He was a great guy, a really nice person. This is horrific. We really couldn't believe it,\\" she said. Herkimer County Community College lifted a lockdown during the afternoon, and schools near the scene released students. D'Amico said most of the three-block neighborhood around the search scene was evacuated. Herkimer is a village of 7,700 named for the German immigrant family that settled in the western Mohawk Valley in the 1720s. The economically distressed villages are 2 miles away from Ilion, where a 2-century-old Remington Arms gun plant is a major employer. ___ Associated Press writers Chris Carola and Mary Esch in Albany and Tom McElroy in New York contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"In Herkimer County, New York, a man suspected of killing four people and injuring two others in a shooting spree is believed to be surrounded by police.

Question: Who or what does Roman trade to Sabian in exchange for restoring the building's electricity? Title: The Negotiator Movie plot: Lieutenant Danny Roman (Jackson) is a top police hostage negotiator. When he cannot talk a hostage-taker into surrendering, he offers himself as an additional hostage and lures the subject into a position where he can be taken down with the minimum use of force, rather than an all-out assault.Roman is middle-aged and recently married. While celebrating his most recent success, he is approached by his colleague Nathan 'Nate' Roenick (Guilfoyle) who warns him that large sums of money are being embezzled from the Chicago Police Department's disability fund of which Roman is on the board. Roenick has an informant with whom he was at the Police Academy and served with for a while, but refuses to name him. Later that evening, Roman is summoned via his pager for another meeting with Roenick but instead finds him dead by gunshot wounds.The case goes badly for Roman when it is assigned to Inspector Niebaum (Walsh) of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) whom Roenick claimed was part of the embezzling. Furthermore the gun used to kill Roenick was one of three that were part of a case Roman handled in the past: two were recovered but not the third. Documents found in Roman's house indicate that the money has gone to an offshore account of which he denies any knowledge.Facing serious charges, suspended from the force and rejected by his friends, including Roenick's widow, a frustrated Roman storms into Niebaum's office and, in the chaos that follows, takes him and several others hostage, including his personal assistant Maggie (Fallon), police Commander Grant Frost (Rifkin) and two-bit con-man Rudy Timmons (Giamatti).With the building evacuated and placed under siege by police and FBI, Roman issues his conditions which include finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lieutenant Chris Sabian (Spacey), another top negotiator.

Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization.

Chicago's rich political history and deeply ingrained identity could prove to be more challenging for Emanuel than initially anticipated.

Emanuel has already faced criticism for his direct style and close connection to the Obama presidency. Some see him as an outsider trying to impose his worldview onto a city that has a rich history of resisting change from non-native politicians. Furthermore, Emanuel's ties to the elite world of Washington may not sit well with some working-class Chicagoans who value the local grassroots connections their city was built upon. To succeed, Rahm Emanuel must balance his tough, no-nonsense attitude with an ability to forge connections with people from all walks of life in Chicago. He must tackle the city's urgent challenges – including gun violence, an ever-looming debt crisis, and a struggling public school system – while also crafting a vision for the city's future that resonates with its residents. Overcoming these obstacles will not be easy, and Emanuel might have to learn how to adapt to the local political terrain in a way he's never done before. But as the race to fill Mayor Daley's shoes intensifies, Emanuel has the opportunity to prove—to Chicago and the nation—that he is more than just a capable leader. He has the chance to redefine what it means to be a mayor in a city renowned for its political grit and resilience. As Chicagoans prepare to cast their ballots, it remains to be seen if Rahm Emanuel can successfully forge a path that will lead him to the coveted fifth floor mayoral suite. But one thing is certain: in the rough-and-tumble world of Chicago politics, nothing is taken for granted, and Emanuel's journey to City Hall will be anything but predictable. So, as the national media jumps from one conclusion to the next, let us remember that Chicago's electorate can be an unpredictable force, and the path to the mayor's office is one fraught with twists, turns, and relentless challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules.

Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London, England. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

Summarize the following: It is essential to get a checkup at your vet before your travel in order to receive a health certificate, often required for airline travel, and proof of vaccination. Many transportation services open to the public (trains, planes, boats) require a health certificate and proof of vaccination before agreeing to transport your dog. Carry all of your dog’s documentation with you while you are travelling to avoid any issues with veterinary border control or emergency illnesses. Depending on where you're traveling, your pet's health certificate may need to be issued no earlier than 10 days before your travel date. While you're at the vet, be sure to stock up on all necessary medications. If you are flying or driving to another country, be sure to check for their immigration and veterinary border control policies. Contact the airline you are traveling with as well as the border control for the country you will be arriving in to find out what restrictions and laws you need to abide by.k Some countries will require your dog to have specific vaccinations. They may also require your dog to be quarantined for a certain amount of time upon arrival at their border. Consult the airline you are travelling with to be put in touch with veterinary border control. Some airlines will not transport certain dog breeds, and some airlines won't fly dogs in extreme heat or cold. Crating your dog is recommended for both their and your safety. Before crating, be sure to exercise your dog so that they are more comfortable resting. Go for an extra long walk or run before putting your dog in the car or arriving at the airport. Whether you are driving or flying you’ll eventually need to find a dog-friendly hotel. Ask your hotel what their pet policies are when you are booking. Some hotels charge extra for animals, and some have breed and size restrictions. Bring extra waste bags and wipes in case your dog has an accident at the hotel. Find out if your accommodation is near a park, lake, trail, or field that you and your dog can walk to for exercise and bathroom breaks. It comes in handy for cuts, ticks and the like. It will give you peace of mind if nothing else! Make sure your kit also includes any medications that your dog might need. Emergency kits should contain all of your dog’s relevant paperwork, a nylon leash, muzzle, and various medical supplies like hydrogen peroxide, gauze, bandages, tweezers, and adhesive tape. Sedating your dog can often cause unwanted complications as most sedatives will reduce your dog’s response to pressure and climate changes. Instead of sedating your dog, be sure to give them plenty of exercise before crating and have drinking water close by. Consult your vet if you are concerned that your dog may be in need of a sedative or tranquilizer while travelling. Summary:","completion":"Before you travel with your dog, you need to visit the vet to make sure they are healthy and have all their shots. You'll get some important papers that you need to take with you. Some countries and airlines have special rules, so ask them what you need to do. It's also a good idea to crate your dog, go for a long walk before traveling, and find a hotel that likes pets. Also, bring a special kit with medicine and supplies for your dog, just in case. Try not to give your dog any sleeping medicine, instead make sure they have lots of exercises and water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I read this background article the other day: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

This implies that the plane did not reach production before the end of the war. Without additional information concerning post-war production or testing activities, we cannot draw comprehensive conclusions about whether the Rikugun Ki-202 ever reached a state where it was capable of flight. However, given the specific wording of the sentence in question, it is reasonable to conclude that without a completed production process, a prototype - if it even existed - would have unlikely been able to fly. Furthermore, there is no recorded historical evidence of operational Rikugun Ki-202 aircrafts, supporting the narrative that the model never saw flight. Also, it's essential to know that plane construction doesn't necessarily guarantee flight. It's possible for aircraft to be built but remain grounded because of engineering issues, safety concerns, or a lack of necessary resources, such as fuel or trained pilots. In the case of the Rikugun Ki-202, even if some form of production occurred after Japan's surrender, there is no provided evidence to suggest it ever successfully flew.

You are presented with the quiz \\"What does the gravitational pull of the moon cause?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth 's oceans causes the tides\\" and \\"rivers drain into the Pacific Ocean\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What does the gravitational pull of the moon cause?\\" based on the hints given by the teacher is that the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth causes the tides. The gravitational force between the Moon and Earth is mainly responsible for causing tidal fluctuations on our planet. Earth and its oceans are consistently pulled toward the Moon due to this gravitational attraction. As Earth rotates each day, different regions of its surface pass the point closest to the Moon, which results in water in these areas being pulled towards the Moon, producing high tides. Moreover, since the gravitational pull is not uniform across Earth, water also accumulates on the opposite side of the planet, forming another high tide area at the same time. This occurs because the gravitational force is weaker further from the moon, causing a stretching effect that results in two tidal bulges. In addition to the high tides, low tides also occur when the water moves away from the areas experiencing high tides. Essentially, high tides and low tides occur in an alternating pattern, approximately every six hours, as Earth rotates. The teacher's second hint about rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean is not directly related to the main effect of the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth. However, it might be worth noting that tides can have an impact on river water levels near river mouths that open into the oceans. In these cases, tidal fluctuations can lead to changes in the water levels of estuaries, deltas, and other coastal zones, which could influence the flow of rivers and their tributaries into the ocean. In conclusion, the essential answer to the question is that the gravitational pull of the Moon on Earth mainly causes the tides, influencing the rise and fall of water levels in the oceans and, to some extent, nearby rivers and coastal areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One star is not for product but for dealer. Movie when it works gets five stars. Understanding that this can happen any time with a DVD I requested the dealer to provide a replacement but he indicated that it was out of stock and provided a refund instead. However a check of that dealers site that day showed that he had 16 copies of the exact product that I ordered in stock and available for sale. It was apparently easier for him to provide a refund than to fix the problem. Some customer service, I will never make another purchase from this dealer again. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The customer was dissatisfied.

Set in the idyllic suburbs of Ohio, the Beindorf family is pushed to the brink when Ned and Janet announce their decision to separate after 18 years of marriage. Inspired by his best friend Matt Finley's offhand remark about locking his parents in a closet until they reconcile, Grover comes up with an ingenious plan. The siblings transform their basement into a Hawaiian-themed escape reminiscent of their parents' honeymoon in a last-ditch attempt to rekindle their love. Despite their well-intentioned efforts, Ned and Janet's arguments continue to escalate during the Hawaiian dinner, leading Grover and Stacey to lock them in the basement, vowing not to release them until they resolve their issues and return to a loving partnership. As word spreads about Grover's bold move, the notorious school bully, TJ Krupp, becomes enamored with the idea and decides to take matters into his own hands. He not only beefs up the security measures on the Beindorf basement door but also locks his own dysfunctional parents, Donald and Gwenna Krupp, in alongside Ned and Janet. Matt, not wanting to be left out and hoping to keep his father, Vic, married to his current wife, Louise, follows suit. The engaging and unconventional dynamics in the basement eventually give rise to the couples beginning to reevaluate their relationships and address their differences more constructively. The journey of self-discovery and the importance of communication begin to surface, shedding new light on their marriages. Outside the basement, Grover develops a newfound bond with his long-time crush, Brooke Figler, as they confide in each other about their family struggles.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

Information: - The phrase territorial police force varies in precise meaning according to the country to which it is related, generally distinguishing a force whose area of responsibility is defined by sub-national boundaries from others which deal with the entire country or a restricted range of crime. - A molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge. However, in quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the term \\"molecule\\" is often used less strictly, also being applied to polyatomic ions. - A police officer, also known as a policewoman, policeman, police agent is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. - Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life. They are composed of monomers, which are nucleotides made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. If the sugar is a simple ribose, the polymer is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the sugar is derived from ribose as deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). - A macromolecule is a very large molecule, such as protein, commonly created by polymerization of smaller subunits (monomers). They are typically composed of thousands of atoms or more. The most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates and polyphenols) and large non-polymeric molecules (such as lipids and macrocycles).

He is especially interested in forensic science and has served on national committees particularly in the field of DNA in police investigation . - Tayside Police was a territorial police force covering the Scottish council areas of Angus, City of Dundee and Perth and Kinross (the former Tayside region) until 1 April 2013, at which point it was subsumed into Police Scotland. The total area covered by the force was with a population of 388,000. The force operated from 27 police stations and has an establishment of 1078 police officers, 151 special constables and 594 support staff, as of February 2008. Tayside Police was Scotland's fourth-largest police force. - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. - Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.

Article:The ring of steel surrounding Cardiff Castle was condemned by taxi drivers and traders for causing chaos since it was erected two weeks before the event. First Minister Carwyn Jones thanked people for their tolerance, saying it would benefit Wales in the long term. There was minimal disruption around the main summit venue, the Celtic Manor Resort on the outskirts of Newport. More than 60 world leaders, 4,000 delegates and 1,500 journalists were in south Wales on Thursday and Friday for one of the biggest international events ever to take place in the UK. With the summit taking place on the eastern outskirts of Newport there was little disruption in the city itself, but parts of central Cardiff were sealed off completely in advance of dinners for the visitors at Cardiff Castle and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama on Thursday. Several shops in the centre of Cardiff closed their doors during the summit, complaining that trade had fallen since the security fences first went up in mid-August. Cardiff council called in contractors to start dismantling the city centre barriers on Friday and promised they would be cleared by Sunday afternoon ready for the start of the working week. Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for transport, said: \\"I would like to thank residents, visitors and commuters for their patience with the security measures that needed to be put in place by the security services. \\"The priority of the administration is to get the fence line taken out of the city centre as quickly as possible and this is why contractors will be working around the clock to make this happen. \\"We will then be working with our partners to get the fence taken down from Bute Park and Cardiff Bay as quickly as possible.\\" The following road closures will remain in effect while the work takes place: However, the council has warned of other road closures on Sunday morning in the Cathays and Roath areas of the city for the Cardiff 10K charity run. There had been warnings of likely traffic congestion on the M4 in south Wales on Friday afternoon as the summit drew to a close and delegates departed, but there were no serious delays. Cardiff Airport had opened a temporary terminal to handle Nato-related traffic with an extra 100 staff on duty to run it, with some road restrictions remaining in place until midnight on Friday. Road closures in Newport around the Celtic Manor Resort were lifted early on Saturday morning. First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute to people and businesses in south Wales for supporting the summit, and their tolerance of some \\"inevitable disruption\\" from the security and logistical operation. \\"I am firmly of the view that the benefits to Wales greatly outweighed any short term disruption,\\" he said. Protest marches in Newport and Cardiff passed off largely peacefully, with four people arrested in Cardiff. Around 100 people had set up a peace camp at Tredegar Park, on the western side of Newport, representing a range of causes. A further four arrests were made on Friday, after protestors entered a bank in Newport and two people attached themselves to a barrier. The incident happened at Barclays on Commercial Street just after 15:20 BST. A spokesperson for the joint Nato policing operation said four people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. A four - a 60-year-old woman from Swansea, a woman from Kent, 49, a Glasgow woman, 33, and a man from London, 39 - are all in custody.

Before the establishment of the People's Republic, Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between World War I and World War II. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the Party gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population. Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male literacy rate is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%. With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The University of Tirana is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

TiVo Posts Profit as Revenue Rises 4% TiVo posted a quarterly profit for only the third time in its 11-year history on Wednesday as the pioneer in digital video recorders improved margins on hardware and reduced marketing costs. It was also the first time TiVo had back-to-back quarters of profit. The company reported 2.9 million in net income, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of 17.7 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

By Beth Stebner and Reuters Reporter PUBLISHED: 20:29 EST, 13 March 2013 | UPDATED: 05:36 EST, 14 March 2013 The architect of Google’s Android’s operating system, Andy Rubin, is stepping down unexpectedly after a seven-year stint in the job. The surprise change was announced by Google on Wednesday and could raise new questions about Android’s direction as Google competes with Apple, Microsoft, and other tech companies rushing to gain ground in the lucrative mobile computing market. In his place, Google has appointed Sundar Pichai, the executive overseeing its Chrome web browser and applications like Google Drive and Gmail, to take over Rubin's spot. In 2008, Pichai aggressively pushed Google's Chrome browser, when OPTIONS: - Android's Explorer lorded over the market. - Andy Rubin's Explorer lorded over the market. - Apple's Explorer lorded over the market. - Beth Stebner's Explorer lorded over the market. - Chrome's Explorer lorded over the market. - Drive's Explorer lorded over the market. - Galaxy S IV's Explorer lorded over the market. - Gmail's Explorer lorded over the market. - Google's Explorer lorded over the market. - Google Drive's Explorer lorded over the market. - Microsoft's Explorer lorded over the market. - New York's Explorer lorded over the market. - Reuters's Explorer lorded over the market. - Rubin's Explorer lorded over the market. - Samsung's Explorer lorded over the market. - Sundar Pichai's Explorer lorded over the market.","completion":"In 2008, Pichai aggressively pushed Google's Chrome browser when Microsoft's Internet Explorer lorded over the market. This was a bold move by Pichai, as Microsoft's Internet Explorer had dominated the browser market for several years, with rivals like Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari fighting to gain a foothold. Under Pichai's leadership, Google Chrome quickly gained traction and soon became a formidable competitor in the browser market. By focusing on speed, stability, and frequent updates, Google's Chrome browser revolutionized the way people experienced the internet. It introduced several new features, such as syncing across multiple devices, an omnibox for search and url input, and the quick incorporation of new web standards. As a result of Pichai's strategic direction, Google Chrome has since overtaken Microsoft's Internet Explorer as the world's most used web browser. It is now considered the gold standard for web browsing, continuing to adapt and innovate as new devices and web technologies emerge. In addition to Chrome's success, Pichai has played a critical role in the management and development of other Google products, such as Google Drive and Gmail, ensuring that they remain competitive and relevant in an ever-changing tech landscape. With his proven track record in overseeing popular Google products, it is no surprise that Sundar Pichai was appointed to take over Andy Rubin's position after his unexpected departure. As the new head of Android, Pichai now faces the challenge of steering the world's most widely used mobile operating system in a rapidly evolving market. Some of the potential challenges he may face include dealing with fragmentation issues within the Android ecosystem, ensuring that Google's own suite of applications and services remain competitive on Android devices, and contending with rival operating systems like Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows. Furthermore, Pichai must keep an eye on emerging mobile trends to ensure that Android remains at the forefront of mobile innovation. In conclusion, Sundar Pichai's aggressive push for Google's Chrome browser in 2008 marked the beginning of a significant shift in the browser market. His strategic vision and leadership helped propel Google Chrome to become the world's most popular web browser, overtaking Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Pichai's appointment as the head of Android following Rubin's departure showcases Google's confidence in his ability to continue guiding their products to new heights in an increasingly competitive market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Undercover and alone, Agent Brown must navigate through the murky waters of crime and sin that threaten the city and its innocent civilians. Act 1: Establishing the unique culture and charm of New Orleans, we first meet Agent Christopher Brown. He is assigned to investigate allegations of police corruption. Brown is an idealistic man of unwavering integrity, who quickly realizes how deep the roots of corruption go after witnessing the locals' fear of law enforcement. He accepts the challenge to right the wrongs done by those in power. Act 2: Going undercover as a newly transferred police officer, Agent Brown infiltrates the corrupt department. He befriends a veteran cop, Marcus, who was once a good and honest officer but fell prey to the increasing corruption. Marcus senses a glimmer of hope in Brown and ultimately helps him gather evidence of the criminal activity perpetuated by his fellow officers. Meanwhile, Brown discovers that the police have ties to the underworld, including an influential crime lord named Vincent Lucchesi. To maintain control, Vincent blackmails and bribes several officers, including the police chief. In order to bring them all down, Brown must gain Vincent's trust without jeopardizing his cover. Act 3: Brown becomes entangled in a dangerous game as the local mafia boss, Vincent, involves him in high-stakes heists and criminal operations. Simultaneously, Brown collects enough evidence to build a case against Vincent and the corrupt officers. However, the department catches wind of a mole among them and begins hunting him down. In a thrilling finale, Brown is cornered and exposed during a confrontation with the police chief. At the eleventh hour, Marcus comes to his aid, and together, they face down the corrupt officers and Vincent's henchmen in a climactic shootout. The police chief is apprehended, but Vincent escapes, vowing revenge. Epilogue: The movie ends on high note as justice is served, and the corrupt officials are taken into custody. Brown's integrity and determination have made a significant impact in New Orleans. However, the plot leaves a thread of unfinished business with Vincent still at large, leaving room for a potential sequel.

A comical hostility between the two girls leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and isolate the twins from the other girls.Living together in an isolation cabin, Hallie and Annie discover they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight they are twins, the girls act a plan to meet their previously unknown parents. Each girl trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp.When camp is over, the twins put their plan into action. Hallie, pretending to be Annie, goes to London to meet her mother, her maternal grandfather, Charles, and the James family's butler, Martin (Simon Kunz). Annie, pretending to be Hallie, goes to California to meet her father, the Parker family's housekeeper, Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter), their dog Sammy, and Nick's young, opportunistic fiancée, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who is only interested in Nick's money. Distressed by Meredith's deviousness, Annie telephones Hallie and persuades her to bring Elizabeth to California to break up the engagement. However, Charles catches Hallie on the phone, and in California, Chessy figures out that it's Annie and not Hallie there....

How does the sentence end? (CNN)It's starting to feel a little bit like Groundhog Day when it comes to parents under attack for letting their children do things on their own. The latest case? A Silver Spring, Maryland, couple is facing a neglect investigation for letting their 10-year-old son and 6-1/2-year-old daughter walk home from a playground, about a mile from their house, by themselves on a Saturday afternoon in late December. The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald's and a Florida mom arrested after letting her 7-year-old walk to the park alone.","completion":"The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald's and a Florida mom arrested after letting her 7-year-old walk to the park alone. Both of these incidents, and the one involving the Maryland couple, highlight what many are considering to be a growing trend of overprotective parenting and the criminalization of what was once considered normal childhood independence and autonomy. More and more, parents are facing increasing scrutiny over their decisions and choices, particularly when it comes to allowing their children to engage in unsupervised activities. This heightened awareness is likely due, in part, to the prevalence of social media and the ease with which news stories like these can spread and become the subject of public debate. In these instances, parents are often the target of criticism, with some arguing that they are being reckless with their children's safety, while others insist that they are merely promoting a sense of independence and responsibility in their offspring. One major factor contributing to the increased concern surrounding children's safety is the perception that the world is becoming a more dangerous place for them. Despite statistics that show rates of violent crime against children have actually decreased in recent years, many parents still feel a heightened sense of fear. This could be driven by sensationalized news reporting and an 'availability heuristic' – the idea that people are more likely to overestimate the prevalence of a problem if they can easily recall examples of it. Another contributing factor to these incidents is a phenomenon known as \\"helicopter parenting,\\" a term coined to describe the highly involved and protective behavior some modern parents exhibit. Helicopter parents often hover over their children, providing constant guidance, direction, and support, thereby limiting their opportunities for independent growth and development. This parenting style is thought to have resulted, in part, from an increased focus on child safety and a desire to minimize potential risks, both real and perceived. Encouraging children to be self-sufficient and develop autonomy has numerous benefits, including fostering resilience, problem-solving skills, and a sense of self-reliance. However, these incidents of parental scrutiny have raised questions about how much independence is appropriate and at what age. There is no universal formula or correct answer to this question, as each child's maturity and capabilities differ, and parents must ultimately make these decisions based on their own judgment and understanding of their child's unique needs and abilities. In many cases, the outcome of such investigations largely depends on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction in which they occur. For instance, Maryland's child neglect statutes provide that children under the age of eight should not be left alone within a building, enclosure, or vehicle without proper supervision, while South Carolina's laws do not specify a minimum age for children to be left unsupervised. Ultimately, these incidents have sparked a national conversation about the balance between protecting children and facilitating their growth and development. They force us to question our own assumptions about what constitutes good parenting and whether the fear of potential dangers is causing us to over-correct to the point of inhibiting the natural and essential process of learning and growth. In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, providing children with the tools to navigate their environments safely and independently is of utmost importance, and that sometimes means allowing them to take small, calculated risks under carefully assessed circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation would be directly impacting a step of the process. Justification: 1. A forest fire starts - This step is not directly affected by the fewer deaths of animals in the fire. 2. The fire surrounds the vicinity - This step also doesn't directly involve the animals and their survival. 3. The animals are trapped - Since fewer animals die in the fire, it means some animals can potentially escape the trap or find a way to survive within the trapped region. Thus, this step is directly impacted by the fewer deaths of the animals. 4. Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - This step involves the animals that survived the fire, but the number of survivors is already impacted in the previous step. Therefore, this step is not directly affected. 5. The survivors must find a new habitat - This step is indirectly impacted because more animals surviving the fire might make it more challenging to find a new suitable habitat for them. 6. Conflict with other animals occur - This step is also indirectly impacted by more animals surviving the fire as it might lead to more conflicts due to a higher number of displaced animals. However, this is a result of the change that occurred in a previous step. In conclusion, the perturbation of fewer animals dying in the fire would directly impact the \\"The animals are trapped\\" step of the process, as it requires a change in the way animals respond to the trap or the fire's behavior itself to allow more animals to survive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite their contrasting skills in karate, Kenneth and Eric shared a strong friendship, often found practicing together after school at the local dojo. Kenneth, always brimming with energy and exceptional athleticism, seemed like he was born to practice karate.

He had a knack for picking up new techniques and refining his form at a pace that left most of his colleagues astounded. On the other hand, Eric struggled with his physical abilities from the beginning. As simultaneously endearing and frustrating his clumsiness was, it often left him lagging behind in their karate sessions, fumbling and tripping over his own feet. Despite his struggles, Eric never allowed his natural clumsiness to deter him from his passion for karate. He maintained a positive attitude, determined to improve and overcome his limitations. His perseverance and heart were truly inspiring, and his love for the martial art was contagious. Noticing that his friend needed help, Kenneth took it upon himself to guide and support Eric in honing his skills. Knowing that there was a strong potential in his friend, he provided him with all the encouragement and assistance he required to excel in karate. Kenneth devised specific training methods tailored to Eric's capabilities, focusing on improving his balance, coordination, and overall agility. During their extra practice sessions, the two would work together for hours, repeating various drills, and correcting each other's mistakes. They shared laughs, tears, sweat, and setbacks; yet, their bond only grew stronger as they became more in sync with each other's movements. Kenneth and Eric were an unstoppable team, a living testament to how friendship could overcome any challenges and bring out the best in one another.
