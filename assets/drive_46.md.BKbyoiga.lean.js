Q:Background: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. Paragraph: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean? A:","completion":"Given the information provided, it is plausible to assume that the Madrigal Ocean is likely connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. In the context provided, the Arctic Ocean on Earth, with a relatively lower salinity compared to other major oceans, receives heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams. A similar analogy is being drawn for the Madrigal Ocean on the other planet, which has a lower salinity than the Listy Ocean. The lower salinity level could be due to more freshwater influx, possibly from a larger number of rivers flowing into the Madrigal Ocean as compared to the Listy Ocean. However, it is important to note that the final conclusion should be made based on more direct scientific observations and data, because several factors can influence ocean salinity levels, including evaporation, ice melting and freezing, and underwater currents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Percy Tyrone Sledge (November 25, 1940 - April 14, 2015) was an American R&B, soul and gospel singer. He is best known for the song \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\", a No. 1 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, Gold-certified disc from the RIAA. Having previously worked as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his strongest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. Sledge was born on November 25, 1940, in Leighton, Alabama. He worked in a series of agricultural jobs in the fields in Leighton before taking a job as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama. Through the mid-1960s, he toured the Southeast with the Esquires Combo on weekends, while working at the hospital during the week. A former patient and mutual friend of Sledge and record producer Quin Ivy introduced the two. An audition followed, and Sledge was signed to a recording contract. Sledge's soulful voice was perfect for the series of soul ballads produced by Ivy and Marlin Greene, which rock critic Dave Marsh called \\"emotional classics for romantics of all ages\\". \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was Sledge's first song recorded under the contract, and was released in March 1966. According to Sledge, the inspiration for the song came when his girlfriend left him for a modelling career after he was laid off from a construction job in late 1965, and, because bassist Calvin Lewis and organist Andrew Wright helped him with the song, he gave all the songwriting credits to them. It reached No. 1 in the US and went on to become an international hit. When a Man Loves a Woman\\" was a hit twice in the UK, reaching No. 4 in 1966 and, on reissue, peaked at No. 2 in 1987. The song was also the first gold record released by Atlantic Records. The soul anthem became the cornerstone of Sledge's career, and was followed by \\"Warm and Tender Love\\" (covered by British singer Elkie Brooks in 1981), \\"It Tears Me Up\\", \\"Take Time to Know Her\\" (his second biggest US hit, reaching No. 11; the song's lyric was written by Steve Davis), \\"Love Me Tender\\", and \\"Cover Me\\". Sledge charted with \\"I'll Be Your Everything\\" and \\"Sunshine\\" during the 1970s, and became an international concert favorite throughout the world, especially in the Netherlands, Germany, and on the African continent; he averaged 100 concerts a year in South Africa. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did he get into music?","completion":"Percy Sledge got into music in the mid-1960s. He had graduated from jobs in the fields and started working as an orderly at Colbert County Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama. While still working at the hospital, Sledge also started touring the Southeast with the Esquires Combo on weekends. His professional musical career truly began when a mutual friend introduced him to record producer Quin Ivy. After an audition, Sledge was signed to a recording contract and began producing a series of soul ballads with Ivy and Marlin Greene.

The hypothesis states that the stream was too remote for Norm to hike to it. However, the information given in the paragraph contradicts this hypothesis. In the paragraph, we learn that: 1. Norm loved to hike in the mountains and fish. This suggests that he is experienced and enjoys physically challenging activities. 2. A friend told Norm that there were cutthroat trout in a remote stream. This implies that the friend was aware of the remote stream's location and believed that Norm could reach it. 3. Norm made the difficult hike to the stream. This statement confirms that, despite the hike being difficult, Norm was able to complete it and arrive at the stream. The hike being difficult does not necessarily make it impossible for Norm to reach the stream. 4. There were indeed cutthroat trout in the stream, and Norm had a great day fishing. This part implies that Norm successfully reached the remote stream, found the trout, and enjoyed his fishing experience.

And I was wondering What will Sasha want to do next? Possible answers: a). did this to talk b). did this out of love c). stalk Robin Answer:","completion":"It is not possible for me to predict Sasha's exact thoughts or intentions in this specific situation, as I cannot access their personal information or emotions. However, I can provide you with a detailed analysis of the possible answers you have mentioned, which may provide insight into the potential motivations behind Sasha's actions. a) Did this to talk: Sasha could have approached Robin out of a need to communicate something important or as a means to resolve an unresolved issue between them. It is possible that Sasha believes the only way to have a conversation with Robin is to violate the restraining order, thinking that their message is crucial enough to warrant such a step. However, it's important to consider that the decision to get a restraining order is not taken lightly, and any attempt to contact the protected person directly, even for a seemingly valid reason, is an infringement of their personal safety and legal boundaries. b) Did this out of love: Love can sometimes manifest in irrational behaviors and actions that defy logical reasoning. If Sasha's feelings towards Robin have not subsided, they might have felt compelled to get close to them out of a sense of love, affection, or attachment. However, it is essential to understand that true love respects boundaries and the well-being of the other person, and violating a restraining order is a clear breach of trust and security. It is crucial for Sasha to consider different ways of expressing their love or emotions without compromising Robin's safety and autonomy. c) Stalk Robin: Stalking is a pattern of unwanted, obsessive attention or surveillance that could involve following the victim, contacting or visiting them without permission, or monitoring their behavior through physical or digital means. It is a severe violation of privacy and personal space, and it can have significant consequences for the victim's mental and emotional well-being. If Sasha is stalking Robin despite the restraining order, it indicates an unhealthy fixation that is detrimental to both parties involved. In this case, it is crucial for Sasha to seek professional help to address their behavior and for Robin to take the necessary measures to protect themselves further. In conclusion, while I cannot predict Sasha's intentions or next actions accurately, it is essential to acknowledge the gravity of violating a restraining order and the potential harm it can cause to both parties. Furthermore, it is crucial to respect personal boundaries and prioritize the emotional and physical well-being of the individuals involved, offering support and resources accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover. What is the relationship between 'biblis tholus' and 'tharsis quadrangle'?

The answer to this question is:","completion":"(A) The truck was farther away.

In the short story, Dan noticed faint truck headlights first and apparently did not feel threatened, implying that they were at a considerable distance from him. He then continued attempting to break into the house, unbothered by the presence of the truck headlights. However, when the car approached with much brighter headlights, Dan was startled and hid himself in the bushes. His sudden change in behavior indicates that the car headlights were closer and more alarming to him than the truck headlights. The brightness of the car headlights could be an indication that the car was closer to Dan than the truck, and since the car's approach caused Dan to hide, it appears that he considered the car's proximity to be a threat.

I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order.

Summarize this article: The 50-year-old legislator overcame hardships as a single teenage mom to graduate from Harvard. Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth (Photo: Eric Gay, AP) Story Highlights The two-term senator was named 'Rookie of the Year' during her first session Davis was the first member of her family to go to college By 19, she was divorced with a child AUSTIN — Wendy Davis, the fearless state senator who became an Internet sensation with her filibuster of a restrictive abortion bill that ground the Texas Legislature to a halt, has faced tough odds all her life. \\"She's a total fighter,\\" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund and daughter of the late Texas governor Ann Richards. \\"And the thing about Sen. Davis, she says she's going to do something, she gets it done.\\" The daughter of a single mom, Davis, 50, overcame her own hardships as a divorced teenage mother to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School. At 19, Davis decided to become the first member of her family to go to college after hearing of a two-year paralegal program from a co-worker. At the time, she was in a trailer park and raising her daughter by herself. \\"We were the working poor,\\" she told The New York Times. Davis clerked for a federal judge, practiced law and was CEO of a title company before getting into politics with her election to the Fort Worth City Council in 1999. After unseating a longtime Republican incumbent in 2008 for state senator from Fort Worth, Davis, a Democrat, was named \\"Rookie of the Year\\" by Texas Monthly magazine and was re-elected in 2012. ABORTION LIMITS: Texas bill misses deadline On Tuesday night, Davis' 10-hour filibuster of an abortion regulation bill came to an end when the chairman ruled she had gone off topic. Fifteen minutes before midnight, the Senate chamber's packed gallery erupted in raucous shouting, disrupting the proceedings and effectively killing the bill when the midnight deadline for passage came and went. \\"I'm rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans who are being ignored,\\" she said when her speech began, later adding: \\"These voices have been silenced by a governor who made blind partisanship and personal political ambition the priority of our state.\\" Texas Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, second from left, is hugged by Sen. Sylvia Garcia, D-Houston, before filibustering an abortion bill June 25, 2013, in Austin. (Photo: Eric Gay, AP) With each passing hour, Davis' livestreamed filibuster attempt turned into Twittermania as thousands of people followed online and her Twitter following jumped from 1,200 to 20,000. \\"My back hurts. I don't have a lot of words left,\\" Davis said after being showered with cheers by activists at the Capitol. Among political junkies who had never heard of the two-term senator, Davis is suddenly being hailed as a comer for statewide office. It was not the first filibuster victory for the fearless legislator, who is an avid runner and cyclist. In 2011, she clogged up the legislative gears with her filibuster of a budget bill that cut 4 billion from public education in Texas. \\"I know the economy is important to Gov. (Rick) Perry. Obviously, he likes to talk about what a great place Texas is and what a wonderful climate we've created here for that,\\" Davis told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in January. \\"But if we don't have an educated workforce, it won't be long before we lose our footing there.\\" Her rookie talkathon then ran out the clock and forced the Republican governor to call a special session. The high-profile stunt not only put a big spotlight on the freshman senator. It also made her a big political target for unhappy Republican power brokers. Perry took a swipe at the first-term senator for upending his budget maneuvers in the 2011 legislative session: \\"We come here to work. We don't come here to be show horses.\\" But the cool and collected Davis, who has championed women's issues in the Legislature, shrugged off any worry of repercussions. \\"I've never worried about payback,\\" she told The New York Times.\\"People are hungry for leadership that's not afraid of political consequence.\\" Before Tuesday night, Davis was known among Texas political insiders and Austin-based activists but generally unknown throughout the state, said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. In a poll conducted by UT/Texas Tribune earlier this month, more than half of respondents said they had never heard of Davis, while 11% had a favorable opinion of her and 12% had an unfavorable opinion of her, Henson said. That changed Tuesday night. \\"Those numbers are immediately obsolete,\\" he said. \\"My suspicion is that those numbers are going to be up – on both ends.\\" It might also open up new political avenues for Davis. The progressive political blog Daily Kos took note of her new high-profile and began asking readers whether it should start a draft movement for Davis to run against Perry in 2014 if he seeks a fourth term as governor. Public Policy Polling had taken a sounding in January about just such a matchup and found that the largely unknown Davis even then was only trailing Perry 47-41. \\"Wendy Davis would nationalize that Texas governor's race, and help accelerate the state's transition to Purple (and eventually Blue) status,\\" Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas wrote in a post.

Webster Wednesday, June 26, 2013 0:46 EDT Update: Davis filibuster succeeds amid chaos as Republicans fail to legally pass anti-abortion bill Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said he hopes that Sen. Wendy Davis (D), who conducted a 10-hour filibuster against a bill that would close all but five abortion clinics in the state and ban all abortions after 20 weeks, will run for statewide office. Speaking to Raw Story from the Texas Capitol on Tuesday night, Hinojosa said she would likely win a bid for the governor’s office thanks to her marathon filibuster. “I’m so proud of her effort and what she’s showed Texas,” Hinojosa said. “Women deserve, in this state, to be treated with dignity. I think that she’s taken it to the Republicans in a way that was not expected. She has put them to shame and made us all very, very, very proud.” Asked about her potential political future, Hinojosa cracked a wide grin. “Wendy is not only extremely intelligent and articulate, she’s great on the issues and she’s got a great personal story — a single mother who made it out of a life of poverty to go to Harvard law school, then gets elected to the city council and the Texas Senate by beating an incumbent Republican,” he said. “She is someone that can really, really excite people across the state of Texas, who really shows true leadership.” “She doesn’t play games or worry about what’s going to get her votes,” Hinojosa continued. “She does what she believes is right. We’ve been sorely lacking that kind of leadership in the state of Texas for more than 20 years. So, yeah. I’m hoping she runs for statewide office, and I know that should she decide to, all of these women and men that are here today, young and old, will work their hearts out for her. She’d probably get elected governor, or whatever other office she wants to run for.” Davis’s filibuster unceremoniously ended just after 10 p.m. CST when Republicans cited her on a third “point of order” for allegedly going off-topic by mentioning Planned Parenthood in her filibuster of S.B. 5. At the time of this writing, fellow Texas Democrats were pulling out all the stops to block a full vote on S.B. 5 by using arcane parliamentary tactics to delay until midnight, when the special session officially ends. S.B. 5 would ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — well before medical experts say a fetus is viable outside the womb — and force all but five of the abortion clinics in Texas to shut their doors by 2014. If they succeed, it’s still possible that the bill could come up again in the days to follow if Gov. Rick Perry (R) decides to call another special session, which he could do tomorrow if he desires. Perry initially placed the anti-abortion measure on the legislature’s docket as an “emergency” provision, and said at the time he would like to see the right to abortion completely revoked in the state. —— [Photo: Screenshot via YouTube.] ||||| Texas on Tuesday night stole the national spotlight as a state senator led nearly 13 hours of filibuster in protest of a controversial abortion measure — and succeeded in killing the bill. Here’s what you need to know about the Austin showdown: 1. Who led the charge? State. Sen Wendy Davis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, spoke for close to 13 hours on Tuesday as she voiced her opposition to the abortion legislation during the end of a special session of the state legislature. Text Size - + reset PHOTOS: Wendy Davis's filibuster Play Slideshow More from Davis after filibuster ‘’What I think it accomplished is what I hoped it would and that was to inspire people to understand that there are voices here on the senate floor that represent them,” she told reporters. “And I felt empowered by their presence, by their support, by the letters …. They made a difference and they are what makes Texans so amazing. And I am proud to be a Texan tonight.” (PHOTOS: Longest filibusters in history) Davis, raised by a single mother, was by age 19 a single mom herself after being married and divorced. She earned her family’s first bachelor’s degree from Texas Christian University before attending Harvard Law School. First elected to the state senate in 2008, she has had a briefer experience with filibustering before: in 2011, she took to the floor over public education cuts. 2. What was the legislative fight about? At issue was Senate Bill 5, which according to the Texas Tribune “would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, required physicians to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of an abortion facility, required abortions — even drug-induced ones — to be performed in ambulatory surgical centers and required doctors to administer drugs that induce abortion in person.” “Thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of Texans, #SB5 is dead,” Davis tweeted early Wednesday morning. “An incredible victory for Texas women and those who love them.” (Also on POLITICO: Texas filibuster nets national attention) At 3:01 a.m., Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said that the bill had passed after the special session had expired, and therefore couldn’t be signed into law. “An unruly mob, using Occupy Wall Street tactics, disrupted the Senate from protecting unborn babies,” he told reporters, according to the Austin American-Statesman. 3. What’s next for Davis? She received a massive outpouring of support from national figures via social media, sparking some to ponder her next steps. Tweets linked Davis to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (“Hillary Clinton/Wendy Davis 2016” read one popular tweet) and she got nods of support on Twitter from leading Democratic accounts including those belonging to President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. (Also on POLITICO: Texas abortion bill falls) A column in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram asked, “Is Wendy Davis ready for a bigger stage?” and explored the possibility of a gubernatorial run in 2014. “She doesn’t play games or worry about what’s going to get her votes,” Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa told the progressive outlet the Raw Story. “She does what she believes is right. We’ve been sorely lacking that kind of leadership in the state of Texas for more than 20 years. So, yeah. I’m hoping she runs for statewide office, and I know that should she decide to, all of these women and men that are here today, young and old, will work their hearts out for her. She’d probably get elected governor, or whatever other office she wants to run for.” ||||| A Have more to add? News tip? Tell us For state Sen. Wendy Davis, daughter of a stage director, her Tuesday soliloquy stirred matinee-idol talk about a potentially dramatic run for governor. With more than 90,000 viewers watching worldwide on YouTube and stars like Lena Dunham and Julianne Moore egging her on via Twitter, Davis took the Capitol floor to filibuster an abortion bill only two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court made her return to the Senate unlikely. Davis has said only that she’ll run for re-election. But depending on what Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott do with old and new election maps, she might find more support running statewide, particularly with national Democrats pushing her to help nudge Texas from red toward blue. If Perry steps down to focus on a 2016 presidential campaign, the likely Republican nominee is Abbott, one of the party’s staunchest opponents of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. An Abbott-Davis race for governor would win Texas Democrats more attention. And more votes. But the question is whether she could win. “The biggest question is whether Democrats are really ready to compete statewide,” Southern Methodist University political science professor Matthew Wilson said in an email. Eight months before the March primary, no prominent Democrat is running at any level in an election where all statewide offices will be on a ballot led by U.S. Senate and congressional seats, not a presidential campaign. “There’s not a lot of value in just being the party’s latest sacrificial lamb,” Wilson wrote, adding that although Abbott would have an edge, “a Davis candidacy would make things livelier than they’ve been in a while.” Rice political science department Chairman Mark P. Jones, who has written for the online Texas Tribune about the more-purple-than-red nature of Texas government, was much more emphatic. Davis would have “no chance whatsoever,” he said in an email, describing a campaign where Abbott would campaign against Washington Democrats without Perry’s baggage or history of missteps. A campaign might tarnish her future and also get in the way of San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro’s hopes, Jones wrote. Even the filibuster video will be used against her in a state where most voters oppose abortion, he wrote. It’s tough doing a one-woman show.

She tried to brush her hair carefully, not wanting any painful knots. As she brushed, her face scrunched up, showing how tricky it was to untangle her hair. Lisa's mom saw her struggling, so she decided to help. Mom went to the nearby shop, like how we go to the store to buy candy or toys, to get a new bottle of conditioner. While Lisa waited, she kept trying to make her hair more manageable. When mom came back with the new bottle of conditioner, she applied it to Lisa's hair, just like when mommy puts sunscreen on you in the summer to protect your skin. The conditioner helped make Lisa's hair smoother and easier to brush. Now, Lisa's hair looked lovely, shiny, and tangle-free. She smiled at her reflection in the mirror, happy that her mom came to the rescue. She learned the importance of always having a bottle of conditioner in the shower, just like how you need a towel after getting wet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1 Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2 The Buffoon, 1400 AD. The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers!

Q: What doesn;t a player need to touch a disc?, Context: LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.

Write a summary based on this article: BY Dan Friedman New York and New Jersey lawmakers said they will turn the other cheek and support aid for tornado recovery in Oklahoma, whose lawmakers want federal emergency aid for tornado relief even though all but tow opposed aid for Hurricane Sandy. Those pledges came after conservative Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe’s said Tuesday that he voted against aid for Sandy victims but wants it for his state because the two situations are “totally different.” Inhofe said Hurricane Sandy bill was loaded with pork. “They had things in the Virgin Islands,” Inhofe said on MSNBC. “They were fixing roads there, they were putting roofs on houses in Washington, D.C. Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won’t happen in Oklahoma. Inhofe got his facts partly wrong. The Sandy relief bill initially contained money for projects outside of areas damaged by Sandy, with the hope of attracting enough votes to get it through Congress. That spending represented a small portion of the massive bill - and much of it eventually was dropped from the legislation after objections by Republicans in the House. The Sandy relief legislation did not contain money to put roofs on homes in Washington, but there were funds to repair museum roofs damaged by the hurricane. Oklahoma’s other senator, Tom Coburn, a Republican, wants any federal aid for victims of Monday’s tornado to be offset by cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, his spokesman said Tuesday. Democrats, who oppose offsets emergency disaster aid, said Coburn will have to vote against help for his own constituents if he wants to stick to his position. \\"I am gonna go with no offsets,\\" said Senate Appropriations Chair Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.)who said lawmakers are starting to assess how much aid Oklahoma will need. \\"Sen Coburn is consistent in his views and he is consistently wrong,” Mikulski said. Both of Oklahoma’s senators and three of its five House members voted against the 60.2 billion aid package for Sandy victims. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), whose district includes the tornado-shattered town of Moore, Okla., voted for the Sandy package. Rep. Peter King (R-L.I.) who helped move Sandy aid through the House, declined to address Inhofe’s statements but said that he would never deny the state aid because of its elected officials’ opposition to the Sandy aid. “I don’t want the people of Oklahoma to suffer for something politicians have done,” King said. “I’ve been through this. I will support them 100 percent.” -With Joseph Straw dfriedman@nydailynews.com @dfriedman33 ||||| New York Rep. Peter King on Tuesday said he’s willing to overlook the “hypocrisy” of lawmakers who opposed aid for his state in the wake of Superstorm Sandy but might support funding for tornado-stricken Oklahoma. “I think there’s a lot of hypocrisy involved here, [Sen. James] Inhofe saying Sandy aid was corrupt but Oklahoma won’t be,” King (R-N.Y.) told POLITICO. “But I don’t want to hold the people of Oklahoma responsible for what elected officials are saying, for the husband and wife without a home, for the people who lost all their worldly possessions.” Text Size - + reset Peter King unloads on John Boehner over Sandy bill Obama: Nation stands with Okla. King, who stressed that he wasn’t looking for a fight, emphasized that aid should be provided to Oklahoma — which sustained a deadly tornado on Monday — without the requirement of budgetary offsets. (PHOTOS: Oklahoma tornado) “I’ve always believed that but certainly, going through it myself [during Sandy], seeing the devastation a national disaster brings to a district…it’s a [national issue], not a local issue, like Sandy wasn’t a New York, New Jersey issue,” he said. “It’s an American issue, we have an obligation to come forward.” Inhofe (R-Okla.), for his part, said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he had wanted reduced Sandy aid because “everyone was getting in and exploiting the tragedy taking place” by adding funding for unrelated projects to the measure, but said “that won’t happen in Oklahoma.” Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) indicated early on Tuesday that he would support offsets for Oklahoma aid. King was a vocal critic of those in his own party who didn’t back full Sandy funding. “I won’t hold it against anyone,” King said of lawmakers who opposed Sandy aid but could support Oklahoma help without offsets. “I don’t want suffering people in Oklahoma to be held hostage while we engage in political fights, saying ‘I told you so.’ I want to deal with it on the merits.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"New York and New Jersey lawmakers have promised to support aid for tornado recovery in Oklahoma. This comes even though most Oklahoma lawmakers opposed aid for Hurricane Sandy. They now want federal emergency aid for their own state. The lawmakers believe that the situations in Oklahoma and the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy are different. They say that the aid provided for Sandy had additional unrelated expenses, while Oklahoma aid will not have this.

Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit.

India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Question: \\"Why is there a perception that Californians are more health conscious?\\" Answer: \\"Californians rank 10th for physical activity and progressive legislation that aids in obesity prevention and public health promotion\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The perception that Californians are more health-conscious can be attributed to their higher rankings in physical activity, healthy blood pressure, and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables compared to other states. Additionally, California has been known for its progressive legislation in areas such as tobacco control, environmental protection, and obesity prevention, all of which contribute to public health promotion.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said. Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" How long after Timothy Carpenter was convicted did he continue to rob people? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. 100 days B. 10 days C. 0 days D. not enough information","completion":"C. 0 days The case before the U.S. Supreme Court concerns the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. After his conviction, Carpenter did not continue to rob people, so the correct answer is 0 days. The main issue being discussed in the high court is whether law enforcement should be able to access cellphone data without a court-issued search warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that this would violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizures. Several justices raised concerns about privacy in the digital age, making it clear that there is a need to balance civil liberties with the demands of law enforcement in this era of rapid technological change. A landmark decision on this issue may set new precedents in how the government can track individuals using their cellphone data and could potentially change the way law enforcement gathers evidence for cases like Carpenter's. As the ongoing debate over civil liberties and technological advancements continues, the Supreme Court's ruling on this case could have significant implications for privacy rights in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). - Marcus Harris ( born October 11 , 1974 ) is a former American college football player who was an All - American wide receiver who played for the University of Wyoming and won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the best college wide receiver in the nation . - Frederick S. Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943) is a former gridiron football player and coach. He was a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons and later an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed for deep pass receptions, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida. - The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote. - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist. - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist? , can you please find it? Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974.

And what will they eat? To solve the problem, we should have to double our food production. We can also develop a diet of algae , insects and meat grown in laboratories. Algae can grow very quickly at sea, in polluted water and in places that would normally kill food crops. They are already eaten widely in Japan and China and they are eaten by almost everything from shrimps to blue whales. They can fix CO2 in the atmosphere and provide fats and sugars. Man-made meat looks like meat, feels like meat and it is meat, although it's never been from a living, breathing animal. Instead, it is grown from cells in big containers. Moreover, studies show that producing man-made meat will use far less water, energy and land. China has developed \\"green super rice\\", a series of rice types which produce more grain and have stronger ability to fight against floods, salty water, insects and disease. We used traditional plant breeding techniques to cross-breed more than 250 rice types. Green super rice, which is enough to feed an extra 100 million people, will be planted widely in the coming years. Insects like ants are not on most European menus but at least 1,400 kinds are eaten across Africa, Latin America and Asia. Now, with rising food prices and worldwide land shortages, such insects are getting more and more popular. Not only are many insects rich in protein , low in fat and high in Ca and Fe, but insect farms need little space. And they can grow well on paper, algae and industrial wastes. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Answer: Choices: 1). Green super rice is delicious but high in price. 2). In Asia about 100 million people may be faced with food shortages. 3). Man-made meat doesn't look like meat but has the same taste as real meat. 4). One of the reasons why many people begin to eat insects is their rich food value. The answer is:","completion":"4). One of the reasons why many people begin to eat insects is their rich food value. From the passage, we learn that with the increasing global population, there is a need to double our food production by 2050 to accommodate the extra 2.5 billion people on earth. To address this concern, various solutions are being explored, such as developing a diet consisting of algae, insects, and laboratory-grown meat. Algae have the potential to be a sustainable food source as they can grow rapidly in diverse environments and provide essential nutrients. They are already consumed in countries like Japan and China. Man-made meat also shows promise as it can be grown from cells in big containers, using far less water, energy, and land compared to traditional meat production. Another important development mentioned is China's \\"green super rice,\\" which is a series of rice types created through traditional plant breeding techniques. This rice has a higher grain yield and can better withstand floods, salty water, insects, and diseases. Green super rice could potentially feed an extra 100 million people in the future. The passage also highlights that insects, such as ants, are consumed in many countries across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. These insects are gaining popularity, especially considering the rising food prices and global land shortages. One of the reasons for this growing popularity is the rich food value of insects. They are high in protein, low in fat, and contain essential minerals like calcium and iron. Moreover, insect farms require minimal space and can thrive on paper, algae, and industrial wastes. In conclusion, the passage provides information about various innovative and sustainable solutions for addressing the growing global food demand, including algae, laboratory-grown meat, green super rice, and insects. One of the reasons why many people are turning to eat insects is their rich food value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Movie title: Jason and the Argonauts Movie plot: Pelias (Douglas Wilmer), misinterpreting the prophecy given to him by the god Zeus (Niall MacGinnis), usurps the throne of Thessaly, killing King Aristo and most of his family. The infant Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of the king's daughters, Briseis (Davina Taylor), as she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera (Honor Blackman). Because the murder has profaned her temple, the angry Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware \\"of a man wearing one sandal\\". Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong) saves Pelias from drowning (orchestrated by Hera), but loses his sandal in the river; Pelias recognizes him from the prophecy. Learning that Jason intends to find the legendary Golden Fleece, he encourages him, hoping Jason will be killed in the attempt. Jason is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed he can only call upon her for aid five times. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers his direct aid, but Jason declares he can organize the voyage, build a ship, and collect a crew of the bravest men in all Greece. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor. Because their ship is named the Argo after her builder, Argus (Laurence Naismith), the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules (Nigel Green), Hylas (John Cairney), and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, sent by his father to sabotage the voyage. Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a treasure building, surmounted by a gigantic statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body. Hercules refuses to leave until he ascertains the fate of his friend. The other Argonauts refuse to abandon Hercules, so... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Jason and the Argonauts,\\" it is Jason who is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with the gods Zeus and Hera. This event occurs after Jason saves Pelias from drowning – in fact, it is during this rescue that Jason loses his sandal, an incident which fulfills the earlier prophecy that Pelias had been warned about. Once on Mount Olympus, Jason has a conversation with both Zeus and Hera. The goddess Hera expresses her displeasure with Pelias for having profaned her temple years before and decides to become Jason's protector. She warns Jason that he can only call upon her for help five times during his quest for the legendary Golden Fleece, which is said to be located in the land of Colchis. Meanwhile, Zeus offers his direct assistance to Jason, but Jason is determined to prove his capabilities by organizing the voyage, building a ship, and gathering a crew of brave men from all over Greece. These men, named after the ship's builder, Argus, come to be known as the Argonauts. The crew includes many notable figures, such as Hercules, Hylas, and Acastus, the latter of whom is the son of Pelias, sent to jeopardize the journey. During the epic journey, Jason and the Argonauts encounter various challenges and obstacles, including facing a gigantic statue of Talos on the Isle of Bronze. Throughout these trials, Jason calls upon Hera for assistance, making use of her five offers of aid. To sum up, Jason is the main character in the movie \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" who is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. During this encounter, the gods offer their support and protection to Jason as he embarks on a perilous quest to find the Golden Fleece, and Hera allows him to call on her help five times during the voyage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to Louis Fisher in The Politics of Shared Power, Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, \`\`Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat.'' Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \`\`pork barrel spending'', but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in Clinton v. City of New York. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.

A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family. - Universal Music Group, Inc. (also known as Universal Music Group Recordings, Inc. and abbreviated as UMG) is an American-French global music corporation that is a subsidiary of the Paris-based French media conglomerate Vivendi. UMG's global corporate headquarters are in Santa Monica, California. - Fiction Records is a British record label founded by Chris Parry, in 1978, owned by Universal Music Group and based in the United Kingdom. It is best known for being the home of The Cure for over 20 years. It was originally a part of Polydor, but on January 2014, Universal restructured Fiction as a standalone label, removing it from Polydor's corporate affiliation. Fiction repertoire is now released internationally through Caroline (ex-North America). - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5) and published in \\"Music Week\\" magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100). - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty. - Christmastide (also Christmas Time or the Christmas season), also known as Twelvetide, is a season of the liturgical year in most Christian churches. - Kate Marie Nash (born 6 July 1987) is an English singer, songwriter, musician and actress. In the UK, her No. 2 hit \\"Foundations\\" (2007) was followed by the platinum-selling No. 1 album \\"Made of Bricks\\". She was named Best British Female Artist at the 2008 Brit Awards. - \`\` Pumpkin Soup '' is a song by Kate Nash and is her fourth single , the third to be lifted from her debut album Made of Bricks . It was released on 17 December 2007 , making it a contender for the Christmas number one and entered the charts at number 58 on the UK Top 75 based on downloads only , then reached number 40 with a physical release the following week . It reached a peak of number 23 on 6 January , equalling the peak of previous single \`\` Mouthwash '' . - Advent is a season observed in many Western Christian churches as a time of expectant waiting and preparation for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus at Christmas. The term is a version of the Latin word meaning \\"coming\\". - The Nativity Fast is a period of abstinence and penance practiced by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches, in preparation for the Nativity of Christ, (December 25). The corresponding Western season of preparation for Christmas, which also has been called the Nativity Fast and St. Martin's Lent, has taken the name of Advent. The Eastern fast runs for 40 days instead of four (Roman rite) or six weeks (Ambrosian rite) and thematically focuses on proclamation and glorification of the Incarnation of God, whereas the Western Advent focuses on the two comings (or \\"advents\\") of Jesus Christ: his birth and his Second Coming or \\"Parousia\\". - Made of Bricks is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Kate Nash, released in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2007 by Fiction Records, Cherrytree Records, and the Universal Music Group. The album was a commercial success, topping the UK Albums Chart and spawning a number-two single in the form of the lead single \\"Foundations\\".

It will come as no surprise to those working in the UK’s higher education (HE) sector that universities are currently suffused with anxiety. The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

I knew that my daughter’s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath.

A. were very tired B. rested C. worked all day D. exhausted E. muscles tired The best answer is Answer:","completion":"The best answer is D. exhausted. Since you mentioned that you haven't had rest recently, it is quite likely that your body and mind feel worn out from the continuous work and lack of proper relaxation. Exhaustion is a state where one feels both physically and mentally drained due to prolonged or intense activity without adequate rest. This state can manifest as a feeling of tiredness, weak muscles, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and an overall sense of being overwhelmed. Option A, \\"were very tired,\\" may not fully capture the extent of your fatigue, as exhaustion goes beyond regular tiredness and signifies a more severe state. Option B, \\"rested,\\" contradicts your statement about not having had rest recently, so it cannot accurately describe how you feel. Option C, \\"worked all day,\\" is an action, not a feeling, and therefore is unsuitable for describing how you feel at the moment. Finally, option E, \\"muscles tired,\\" touches upon only one aspect of exhaustion, which is physical fatigue, and doesn't account for the mental exhaustion that occurs from a lack of rest. In summary, option D is the best answer since it encompasses both the physical and mental aspect of fatigue that results from not having enough rest.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. I am facing a new situation today: Roger and Samantha are brother and sister. Both of them perform roughly the same amount of physical activity on a day-to-day basis. Roger, however, eats a lot more food relative to the amount he needs given his activity levels. Samantha, on the other hand, eats the appropriate amount of food given her level of activity. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to develop hypertension in the future? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future as compared to Samantha. The reasoning behind this conclusion can be understood through the connection between excess food energy consumption, obesity, and the risk of health problems such as hypertension. According to the article, when a person consistently consumes more food energy than they need, the unused energy is stored in the body as fat. This additional fat accumulation can eventually lead to obesity. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m² or greater, and it is a significant factor associated with an increased risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In the given situation, Roger and Samantha both have similar activity levels. However, Roger consistently eats more food relative to the amount he needs concerning his activity levels, while Samantha consumes an appropriate amount based on her activity level. This suggests that Roger is more likely to accumulate excess body fat and possibly become obese in the long term. As obesity is intimately related to the increased risk of hypertension, and given that Roger is at a higher risk of becoming obese due to his overconsumption of food energy in comparison to his physical activity levels, it can be concluded that Roger is more likely to develop hypertension in the future as compared to Samantha. Samantha's balanced approach to eating and physical activity will likely help her maintain a healthier body composition and weight, ultimately reducing her risk of developing hypertension."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic).

Second question: Why Airtel still not launched fiber broadband? Airtel has been launching fiber broadband services under the brand name \\"Airtel Xstream Fiber\\" in many cities across India. However, the rollout might not yet have reached your specific location for several reasons: 1. Infrastructure development: The deployment of fiber broadband networks is a significant undertaking that demands time, resources, and adequate infrastructure. Airtel may still be in the process of building or upgrading its network in your area. 2. Prioritization of markets: Airtel may opt to prioritize markets based on factors such as demand, market maturity, and competition when launching their fiber broadband services. Consequently, some regions could experience delays in receiving access to the fiber broadband network. 3. Regulatory obstacles: The launch of fiber broadband can be impeded by permits, licensing requirements, or other regulatory issues specific to your region. Airtel may be working to address these challenges before they can proceed with the fiber broadband rollout. 4. Cost considerations: The expense of deploying and maintaining fiber broadband networks can be substantial, prompting Airtel to act prudently in terms of where they launch the service. Market factors, such as return on investment and the potential user base, can influence Airtel's decision to delay the rollout in some regions. In conclusion, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question inquires about editing vector images in Adobe Illustrator on a Mac, while the second question pertains to the rollout of Airtel's fiber broadband services.

In a stunning decision Thursday, Pete Carroll announced that 18-year old Matt Barkley would be his starting quarterback. True freshmen just don't win jobs like that at top-shelf programs with national championship hopes. Barkley, however, is not your ordinary freshman, something the rest of the country is about to learn. Yes, the door on the depth chart widened after third-year sophomore Aaron Corp fractured a bone in his leg, but Barkley took this job and made the decision for the coaching staff surprisingly clear. He was simply better. Better than Corp. Better than Mitch Mustain. Better than anyone in the program expected and that's why he's starting the opener against San Jose State. Since arriving in the spring, it was obvious Barkley was different than any rookie Trojan in recent memory. And it wasn't his physical skills that drew the most attention. Sure, Barkley has remarkable arm strength and accuracy, but those alone wouldn't have made the leap from high school star to USC starter possible. Barkley is unique in ways that stand out most to coaches. He's mature beyond his years, competitive and has already earned the respect of veteran teammates. He has a quiet confidence and a swagger that will settle down even the most skittish huddle. And he possesses the instincts and feel for the position that cannot be taught. Simply, he was born to be a big-time quarterback. That he was born in 1990 makes his development so remarkable. Does Barkley remain in the driver's seat for all 13 games? It's up to him. The schedule has plenty of landmines, beginning with the Week 2 trip to Ohio State. There's no manual to prepare a young quarterback for a night game at the Horseshoe. He has tested the boundaries of expectations throughout his brief athletic career, meaning you might not want to doubt him. And what about Corp? So impressive in beating Mustain for the No. 2 spot a year ago and seemingly the heir apparent once Mark Sanchez bolted, he's left to wonder if his window of opportunity is about to shut. Although Carroll considers competition a cornerstone of his program, a successful Barkley might not look back until after declaring early for the 2012 NFL draft. So, one of the highest-profile programs in the country has a true freshman as its quarterback. Now what? The playbook won't be compromised, or else the kid wouldn't have gotten the nod. It's business as usual at USC until proven otherwise. For Carroll, who has as much goodwill as any coach this side of Gainesville, it's a low-risk move, with an awful lot to gain. If Barkley can't deliver, the coach has a couple of five-star recruits waiting in the wings. Plus, he knows this youngster won't be shaken by a rough start. If the kid flourishes, Carroll becomes the genius coach, who was not afraid to give the ball to a rookie, another huge talking point on the recruiting trail. Heck, this is the same Carroll, who was ready to pull the trigger on starting a young John David Booty a few years ago before injuries changed the blueprint? It turns out that the buzz surrounding Barkley in the spring was real and just a sneak peek of what was about to come. Now that he's earned his first start a few days before his 19th birthday, things are about to get real interesting for the boy wonder and everyone that follows his budding career. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the surprising decision by Coach Pete Carroll to select 18-year-old Matt Barkley as the starting quarterback for USC. Barkley, a true freshman, outperformed his competitors Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, despite the traditionally high stakes in top-tier college football programs. The article highlights Barkley’s maturity, competitiveness, instincts, and natural talent as key factors in his success. It also speculates about Barkley's potential future with the team, as well as the possible implications for Corp and Mustain. Overall, the article suggests that Barkley's decision to start is not only a testament to his abilities but also represents a potentially exciting moment in the future of USC football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 - June 10, 2004), known professionally as Ray Charles, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, and composer. Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called \\"Brother Ray\\". He was often referred to as \\"The Genius\\". Charles was blind from the age of seven. In June 1952, Atlantic Records bought Charles's contract for 2,500 (US23,039 in 2017 dollars). His first recording session for Atlantic (\\"The Midnight Hour\\"/\\"Roll with My Baby\\") took place in September 1952, although his last Swingtime release (\\"Misery in My Heart\\"/\\"The Snow Is Falling\\") would not appear until February 1953. In 1953, \\"Mess Around\\" became Charles's first small hit for Atlantic; the following year he had hits with \\"It Should've Been Me\\" and \\"Don't You Know\\". He also recorded the songs \\"Midnight Hour\\" and \\"Sinner's Prayer\\". Late in 1954, Charles recorded \\"I've Got a Woman\\". The lyrics were written by Ray's bandleader, Renald Richard. Ray claimed the composition. They later openly admitted that the song went back to The Southern Tones' \\"It Must Be Jesus\\" (1954, Duke 205). It became one of his most notable hits, reaching number two on the R&B chart. \\"I've Got a Woman\\" included a mixture of gospel, jazz and blues elements that would later prove to be seminal in the development of soul music. In 1955, he had hits with \\"This Little Girl of Mine\\" and \\"A Fool for You\\". In upcoming years, he scored with \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\" and \\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\\". In 1959, \\"What'd I Say\\" reached the #6 position on the Billboard Pop chart (and #1 on the Billboard R&B chart). During his career, Charles also recorded instrumental jazz albums, such as The Great Ray Charles (1957). During this time, he also worked with the jazz vibraphonist Milt Jackson, releasing Soul Brothers in 1958 and Soul Meeting in 1961. By 1958, Charles was not only headlining black venues such as the Apollo Theater, in New York, but also bigger venues, such as Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival (where his first live album was recorded in 1958). In 1956, Charles recruited a young all-female singing group, the Cookies, and reshaped them as the Raelettes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How a few words can make people hand over millions It was the 1970s in the United States. The country was in the grip of an epidemic: a crime epidemic. From the East Coast to the West, drug use, violence and property crime were at an all-time high. In the state of New Jersey, the police decided to do something about it. They figured that the best way to deter young men from getting involved was by example. Surely if they saw what life is like in prison, they’d be on their best behaviour. The authorities set up a series of visits to Rahway State Prison, in which juvenile delinquents were introduced to “lifers” serving time for offenses ranging from bomb building to selling information to the Mafia. The visits were designed to be as traumatic as possible; inmates swore, screamed and regaled their pupils with graphic accounts of life on the inside – including embellished tales of rape, suicide and murder. The programme became known as “Scared Straight”. Before long it was being copied across the globe, including in over 30 states and Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. The introduction of seatbelts had resulted in either no change or a net increase in road accident deaths It was popular, it was intuitive and it was cheap. There was just one problem: no one ever checked if it actually worked. In 1982, a follow-up study of the young subjects revealed the truth: not only did the programme fail to reduce their likelihood of turning to crime, it actually increased it. Scared Straight is by no means the only policy which has backfired. Take seatbelts. Before they became mandatory back in the 1980s, many expected them to save countless lives – after all, how could safety harnesses possibly be harmful? Some suggested they’d save as many as 1,000 people in their first year. When they were finally introduced, the number of cyclists killed on the roads is estimated to have risen by 40%, while pedestrian deaths increased by one in five. A subsequent analysis of the legislation in 18 countries found that the introduction of seatbelts had resulted in either no change or a net increase in road accident deaths. The counter-intuitive effect has been attributed to “risk compensation”; people typically change their behaviour in response to the perceived level of risk. When the risk is low, people are more reckless. “Sometimes what seems like a fairly good plan may become problematic due to factors you’re not aware of,” says Michael Hallsworth, who works at the UK government’s “Nudge Unit” – but more on that later. In the real world, our actions are a minefield of hidden motivations and psychological quirks. “We used to think that people take into account all of the available information and then weigh up the costs and benefits of different options. And there’s increasing evidence from the last 40 years that that’s not correct,” says Hallsworth. Perhaps the visits to Rahway made the delinquents feel that ending up in prison was inevitable, or merely desensitised them to its horrors. Worse, the programme may have helped to romanticise the “lifers” or set up the harsh realities of incarceration as a challenge. Many nudges take merely minutes, yet their effects may last for decades But it’s not all bad news. As it happens, there may be a way to use these idiosyncrasies to the public advantage. Enter “wise psychological interventions”, popularly known as “nudges”; techniques to bump people’s decision-making in the right direction by unlocking how we really think. They’re subtle, they’re ordinary, they certainly wouldn’t make a compelling documentary – but, crucially, each is rigorously tested to make sure it actually works. The result is an extraordinarily powerful technique which can raise millions or save lives. Many nudges take merely minutes, yet their effects may last for decades. In one study, completing a single one-hour exercise improved students’ grades for three years. In another, citizens were asked about their motivations for voting the day before an election. Simply changing the phrasing of the question increased voter turnout by 11%. This is big: for the 2016 US presidential election, it’s estimated a staggering 4bn will be spent on TV advertising. But even among those who spend the most time glued to their sets, adverts only increase turnout by around 10%. Back in 2010, former UK prime minister David Cameron set up the “Nudge Unit”; a crack team of scientists, psychologists and policy experts tasked with using the technique to improve education, health and the state of public finances. Governments have had difficulty getting people to pay their taxes for millennia – every advanced civilisation has grappled with this question – John List, University of Chicago To solve the latter, they found themselves pondering a perennial problem. They say only two things in life are certain: death and taxes. So why do so many people delay paying them – and how can they be coaxed to cough up? “Governments have had difficulty getting people to pay their taxes for millennia – every advanced civilisation has grappled with this question,” says John List, an economist from the University of Chicago who was involved in the study. In ancient Rome, farmers suffering under their tax burden would abandon their land and flee to the city of Constantinople (now part of Turkey), which was an early tax haven. By the Middle Ages, many men had resorted to joining monasteries – resigning themselves to a life of servitude not out of religious devotion, but the desire to avoid paying tax. With this long history in mind, the team decided to take a fresh approach. At the time, indebted UK citizens could expect to receive a letter telling them how much they owed and how to pay. It wasn’t working. Though the UK has one of the lowest “tax gaps” in the world, last year the amount of unpaid tax was still a hefty £34bn. That’s nearly enough to pay for the UK’s contributions to the European Union three times over. The HMRC could have tried to claw it back by sending people out to bang on doors, pleading with the “criminals” over the radio or spamming their letterboxes with ever more threatening letters. But they didn’t. Instead they took the standard letter and made some subtle additions. To the team’s surprise, this modest increase also occurred when people were reminded of what they gain from taxes In August 2011, around 100,000 people woke up to an envelope on their doorstop. They had all opted to self-report their taxes – rather than the money coming directly out of their pay packet – and owed the HMRC between £400 and £100,000. In case you were wondering, most of the debtors were men of about 50 years old. While one half of the group received the usual letter, the others received a copy with a single extra sentence. The team tried several options, each intended to invoke a different psychological quirk. One of these was “loss aversion”, or the tendency to feel losses more keenly than gains. It has plagued public policy for years: citizens who stand to lose 100 as a result of new legislation are likely to be disproportionately more vocal than those who stand to gain 100. When not paying their taxes was framed in terms of loss “Not paying tax means we all lose out on vital public services like the NHS, roads, and schools”, payment rates increased by 1.6%. That’s equivalent to around £760,000 of extra taxes. To the team’s surprise, this modest increase also occurred when people were reminded of what they gain from taxes. “Paying tax means we all gain from…” Though it wasn’t the result they expected, this is the entire point of testing out policies in clinical trials first. The next set aimed to trigger the citizen’s deep, in-built fear of being different, known as conformity bias. It’s thought to stem from the desire to avoid being rejected by our social group – a factor which had life-or-death significance in our evolutionary past. They noted; “Nine out of 10 people pay their tax on time”. The real breakthrough came from making these statements even more specific But the real breakthrough came from making these statements even more specific. In a later experiment, when the team observed that not only had most people paid, but most people in their area – ie their neighbours – payments shot up. Adding that most people with similar debts had also paid increased their earnings even further. Compared to the control group (who received the normal letter), adding this message – just 26 extra words – increased payment rates by 15%; equivalent to an extra £15.4m in just 23 days. When they were rolled out across the UK, the letters raised an extra £210m in their first year. Based on that estimate, as of today they’ve raised more than £630m. “What’s new about this approach is not just the knowledge of human psychology but it’s that it’s evidence-based policy making,” says List. Since the tax experiment, the team has applied the letters to solve numerous other problems, including tackling the over-prescription of antibiotics by doctors, which is thought to be contributing to rising antibiotic resistance. Discovering that their levels of prescribing were abnormal was so powerful, it reduced the number of prescriptions by 3.5% that winter The traditional approach to encourage doctors to use fewer antibiotics is to pay them. “That’s what we do when we want GPs to do anything right now – we pay them,” says Hallsworth. Instead, the team wondered if they could achieve equivalent results with their letter technique. “So we wrote to them at the start of flu season and told them that they were high prescribers,” he says. Incredibly, discovering that their levels of prescribing were abnormal was so powerful, it reduced the number of prescriptions by 3.5% that winter – equivalent to around a 1% reduction over the course of the year. “That same year we spent £23m on payments to GPs to get the same result,” he says. As of 2016, Nudge Units have been set up in the US, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Germany. And unlike the Scared Straight program, this time there won’t be any surprises.

Movie title: Shutter Island Movie plot: In 1954, two U.S. Marshals â Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule â travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an... Answer:","completion":"In the film, Shutter Island, the protagonist, Teddy Daniels, begins to unravel a complex web of conspiracies and hidden motives. As he gets closer to the truth, it becomes apparent that someone needs to leave the island before the situation spirals out of control. The main turning point which suggests leaving Shutter Island is necessary occurs when Teddy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, discovers the experimentation on patients. He realizes that the doctors are conducting unethical and controversial procedures on the patients, including lobotomies — psychiatric treatments which involve severing the connections to the brain's prefrontal cortex. It is George Noyce, a patient from the restricted Ward C who tells Teddy about the experimentation. Teddy also begins to suspect that the staff and people on the island are involved in a conspiracy. Moreover, he believes that they are all in on a game to toy with his mind and prevent him from discovering the truth. There are several characters in the movie who could potentially foresee the need to leave the island. Teddy himself is the most apparent, as his life is at risk, and he cannot trust anyone around him. His partner, Chuck Aule, played by Mark Ruffalo, could also realize that their mission on the island is becoming increasingly dangerous and the best way to protect Teddy is to leave. Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist (played by Ben Kingsley), might think Teddy leaving the island is ideal if he believes that Teddy is too close to uncovering their secrets and would put their operation at risk. The staff and doctors who have hidden motives would also want Teddy to leave to preserve their operations and prevent authorities from getting wind of their controversial practices. The story reaches its climax when the storm prevents Teddy and Chuck from leaving the island immediately, entangling them further into the hospital's dark secrets. In the end, it is revealed that Teddy Daniels is, in fact, Andrew Laeddis, a patient at Ashecliffe. The entire plot is an elaborate role-play scenario designed by Dr. Cawley to help Teddy/Andrew regain his sanity. In conclusion, the character that suggests the need to leave the Shutter Island is Teddy Daniels/Andrew Laeddis, as he believes he is in danger, and his investigation into the island's secrets puts the hospital's practices at risk. However, leaving the island is complicated because the whole movie is a fabricated scenario created by the doctors as a part of Teddy's therapy. Therefore, throughout the movie, Teddy's need to leave the island serves as a representation of his desire to escape from his own internal struggles and the horrors of his past."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Then, placing himself at their head, he gave the word, and charged down the street upon the Roundheads. The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise. The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions. Groups of twos and threes stood together and attempted resistance, but the main body thought only of regaining their horses. In three minutes after the Royalists entered the village the surviving Roundheads were in full flight, hotly pursued by the victorious Cavaliers. These, being for the most part better mounted, overtook and slew many of the Roundheads, and not more than half the force which had set out returned to their quarters at Didcot. The pursuit continued to within half a mile of that place, and then Harry, knowing that there was a force of Roundhead infantry there, drew off from the pursuit, and returned to Chalcombe. He found that more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms, those quartered in the inn, and at two or three of the larger houses, having alone maintained a successful resistance until the arrival of succor.

Q: Question: what happened to lynne on real housewives of orange county? Would \\"The series is a voyeuristic look into the wealthy lives of these housewives, as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Answer: Lynne Curtin appeared as a regular cast member on Seasons 4 and 5 of the reality television series \\"The Real Housewives of Orange County\\" (RHOOC). The show provides a behind-the-scenes look into the luxurious lifestyles and interpersonal relationships of a group of wealthy women living in Orange County, California. During her time on the series, viewers witnessed various aspects of her life, including her relationships with her husband, Frank Curtin, and her two daughters, Alexa and Raquel. Lynne was initially portrayed as a laid-back, fun-loving mother who owned her own business, Lynne Curtin Designs, focusing on creating handcrafted cuffs and accessories. As the show's 4th and 5th seasons progressed, Lynne faced a series of personal and financial challenges. In 2009, it was revealed that she and her husband were experiencing financial troubles, including being served with an eviction notice for failing to pay several months' rent on their oceanfront home. Furthermore, the couple filed a lawsuit against the property owners, claiming that they were unlawfully evicted and that their belongings had been unlawfully seized. In regard to her personal life, Lynne struggled with disciplining her daughters and parenting them through their own challenges. Her daughters faced various issues, such as reckless behavior and substance abuse problems, which led to several confrontations between them and their parents throughout the show. Lynne's time on RHOOC came to an end after Season 5 when she was not asked to return for Season 6. The reasons behind her departure from the series have not been explicitly stated; however, it could be assumed that it was in part due to the increasing intensity of her personal and financial problems, which had become central to her storyline on the show. Since leaving RHOOC, Lynne has continued to focus on her business, while also dealing with the repercussions of her public life. In 2012, she and her husband Frank officially filed for divorce after 22 years of marriage. Her daughters have also faced various legal issues in the years following their time on the show. In summary, a more accurate answer to the question, \\"What happened to Lynne on the Real Housewives of Orange County?\\" would be: Lynne Curtin was a cast member on Seasons 4 and 5 of RHOOC, during which she faced numerous personal and financial struggles, including foreclosure and eviction, as well as difficulties in parenting her daughters. After leaving the show, she continued to deal with the consequences of her public life, including a divorce from her husband and ongoing challenges related to her daughters. While your suggested answer, \\"The series is a voyeuristic look into the wealthy lives of these housewives, as they shop, get plastic surgery, gossip, fight and live lavishly.\\" does generally describe the premise of \\"The Real Housewives of Orange County,\\" it doesn't directly address the specifics of Lynne Curtin's time on the show or the subsequent events in her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"We will begin by simplifying the given equation -73 + 31 = -69*x + 96. First, we will tackle the left side of the equation: -73 + 31 = -42 Now we have the simplified equation -42 = -69x + 96. In order to isolate x and solve for it, we need to perform the following steps: Step 1: Move the constant term from the right side of the equation to the left side by subtracting 96 from both sides: -42 - 96 = -69x + 96 - 96 -138 = -69x Step 2: Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x, which is -69: -138 / -69 = -69x / -69 x = 2 Therefore, the solution for the given equation -73 + 31 = -69*x + 96 is x = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A bird picks a spot high spot, often in a tree - The bird collects bits of sticks and grass - The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches - Leaves, mud and spider webs are added to the sticks - The mud, leaves and webs glue the sticks together - The solid nest supports the eggs - Question: suppose less blood sugar happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER nests. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"There would certainly be an effect on the quantity and size of bird nests if a bird has a lower blood sugar level. Let's delve deeper into all the associated factors. Blood sugar, or glucose, is a primary source of energy for the body's cells, including the cells in a bird's body. Lower glucose levels, hypo-glycemia, could have a direct impact on a bird's energy levels. For birds, energy is expended not only in daily survival but also in activities such as nest-building. Building a nest (especially larger ones or a higher quantity) is a demanding task that requires substantial energy. Birds gather materials like sticks, grass, leaves, mud, and spider webs, and then delicately construct their nests in an elevated, safe location. This entire process is energy-consuming. Hence, birds with lower blood sugar levels may struggle to acquire the necessary energy to build nests. As a result, they might not be able to construct as many nests or make them as large as birds with higher or normal blood sugar levels. Therefore, it's likely the answer would be B: \\"less.” However, this could also vary depending on various other factors like the bird's overall health, adaptive capabilities, the availability of food sources to restore energy, and so on. Also, it's important to note that birds are equipped with natural coping mechanisms to balance their energy expenditure and can adjust their behavior based on their energy reserves. Still, in a hypothetical situation where the only considerable change is a decrease in blood sugar levels, the answer would be B: \\"less\\". This is based on our current understanding that lower glucose levels equate to lower energy, which consequently could lead to lesser or smaller nests being built. This, however, should be validated by practical observation and research."},{"prompt":"Question: Rose's mom took Rose roller skating one night.

Most garden experts recommend rooting forsythia indoors between december and february. The plant is dormant during this time, so the plant will be in the hardwood stage and cuttings will be less perishable. Available options: [a]. You can root forsythia year-round, but cuttings taken when the bush isn't dormant will be more fragile and require more care and attention. Grow forsythia in well-drained, acidic soil and lots of shade. [b]. Determine if the plant has been kept indoors, or if you need to create an area that will be livened up by new plants. In some countries, the support system for plants will also be installed so the roots of the plants will appreciate irrigation. [c]. Other perentivates may be able to be rooted, and they are usually ready to harvest very soon. If you haven't done so already, prepare some perlite and place it on the ground to trap the root cells.

A: A significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: The concept of viewing biologically distinct races as isomorphic - i.e., defining categories of people with distinct physical and genetic traits - has its roots in the field of anthropology and various scientific disciplines over the past centuries, as well as in the history of racial classification. From the late 17th century onwards, European thinkers and scientists began to grapple with the concept of race and the classification of various groups of people. The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, for example, developed a classification system that included four human \\"races\\" based on both physical and geographic differences: Europeans, Asiatic (Asian), Americans (Indigenous), and Africans. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many scientists, influenced by social Darwinism, accepted the belief that different racial groups were distinct and that some races - particularly those of European descent - were considered superior to others. This perspective, known as scientific racism, was often used to justify unequal treatment of people from various racial backgrounds. Notable proponents of the idea of distinct races being isomorphic were figures such as Robert Knox (an anatomist), Samuel George Morton (an American physician), and Paul Broca (a French physician and anthropologist), who conducted research on human skulls and attempted to draw conclusions about the intelligence and capabilities of different racial groups. These researchers believed in the hierarchy of races, with white Europeans being at the top of this hierarchy, and often claimed that other races exhibit various inferior characteristics. Over time, however, scientific understanding and research in the fields of anthropology, biology, and genetics has demonstrated that the concept of distinct and isomorphic races is not supported by empirical evidence. Furthermore, the idea of \\"race\\" as a biological concept has been widely rejected, and contemporary scientists tend to focus on examining genetic variation within and between populations. One of the key figures in debunking the idea of distinct races being isomorphic was the anthropologist Ashley Montagu, who published the book \\"Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race\\" in 1942. Montagu's research and arguments presented compelling evidence against the concept of distinct racial groups with fixed hereditary differences. In recent decades, geneticists have further elucidated the complex nature of human genetic diversity, showing that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them, and that there is no consistent link between shared ancestry and the physical traits that have been traditionally used to define races. For example, studies by geneticists Richard Lewontin, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, and others have shown how simplistic and misleading the notion of \\"race\\" as a biological category really is. In summary, while many scientists and thinkers in history accepted the belief that biologically distinct races were isomorphic, contemporary research in anthropology, biology, and genetics has revealed that this way of categorizing human populations is scientifically invalid. Instead, most modern scholars prefer to view human diversity through a more nuanced lens, recognizing that the idea of race is more fluid and complex than simple categorizations based on physical appearance or genetic traits."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Casey robbed the cradle dry and left without a trace.

It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The African bush elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") is the larger of the two species of African elephant. - The African forest elephant (\\"Loxodonta cyclotis\\") is a forest-dwelling species of elephant found in the Congo Basin. It is the smallest of the three extant species of elephant, but still the third-largest living terrestrial animal. The African forest elephant and the African bush elephant, \\"L. africana\\", were considered to be one species until genetic studies indicated that they separated an estimated 27 million years ago. Due to a slower birth rate, the forest elephant takes longer to recover from poaching, which caused its population to fall by 65% from 2002 to 2013. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - So - called pygmy elephants live in both Africa and Asia . The African pygmy elephant , formerly described as \`\` Loxodonta pumilio '' , is currently considered to be a tiny morph of the African forest elephant ( L. cyclotis ) . The Borneo elephant ( Elephas maximus borneensis ) , a well - documented variety of elephant , is also called \`\` pygmy elephant . '' This elephant , inhabiting tropical rainforest in north Borneo ( east Sabah and extreme north Kalimantan ) , was long thought to be identical to the Asian elephant and descended from a captive population . In 2003 , DNA comparison revealed them to be probably a new subspecies . The term pygmy elephant should not be confused with \`\` dwarf elephant '' , which is used for a number of extinct species of elephants that evolved their size due to island dwarfing . - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. 'pygmy elephant' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?

Article: My dad was a plumber for the public works department in our town, so from time to time he came into my school. Can you imagine sitting in class and seeing your dad walk past the door of your classroom and wave his hand at you? In junior high?

The girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \\"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\\" As we walked to our car, he said to me, \\"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve was? What a dumb ass!\\" From that point on, her dad was known in school as Lawyer Dumb Ass. When my husband and I bought our house, the first thing my dad showed him was the main shut-off valve.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of keeping insects out of a garden, I would recommend combining multiple methods. Each of these methods targets various types of insects and ensures comprehensive protection for your garden. Here are the steps I would take: 1. Choose insect-resistant plants: By planting insect-resistant varieties, the garden becomes less attractive to unwanted pests. Research on local plant species and consult with experienced gardeners or your local nursery to find out which plants are more resistant to insects. 2. Encourage beneficial insects: Not all insects are harmful to your garden. Some insects, like ladybugs, lacewings, and ground beetles, can be beneficial, as they feast on harmful pests. Planting flowers and herbs that attract these beneficial insects can help keep pests in check. 3. Maintain a clean garden: Remove dead leaves, excess weeds, or debris from your garden regularly. This reduces hiding places for insects, making it less inviting for them to lay eggs. 4. Use physical barriers: Installing physical barriers like insect netting or floating row covers can be an effective way to keep insects out of your garden. Additionally, copper tape can be used around plant pots and raised beds to deter slugs and snails. 5. Manual removal: As soon as you spot harmful insects, manually pick them off and dispose of them appropriately. This reduces the chances of infestations growing further. 6. Use organic insecticides and repellents: If you're experiencing a larger insect problem, consider using organic insecticides and repellents like neem oil, diatomaceous earth, or insecticidal soap. These products are less harmful to the environment and beneficial insects, while still being effective against pests. 7. Rotate crops: Planting the same crops repeatedly in the same area can lead to an increased buildup of pests over time. Crop rotation disrupts the life cycle of pests, making it more difficult for them to establish populations. By following these steps, a combination of preventative and responsive measures can be employed, making it more likely to keep insects out of the garden efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Answering these questions together, the best way to say \\"no\\" depends on the situation, cultural context, and relationship with the person you are addressing. The primary goal when saying \\"no\\" is to be clear and assertive while maintaining a sense of empathy and respect for the other person. Here are some effective strategies and tips to consider in different situations: 1. Be direct and clear: Sometimes, it's better to be direct and not beat around the bush. Firmly yet politely express your refusal, e.g., \\"I am sorry, I cannot do this.\\" 2. Provide a reason (if possible): If there is a valid reason for your refusal, offer it briefly. Doing so can help people understand and feel respected, but be cautious not to provide excessive or unnecessary information. 3. Prioritize your needs: It's important to acknowledge your limitations and prioritize your own well-being. For instance, if a colleague asks for help with a project, and you already have a heavy workload, you could say, \\"I appreciate that you need assistance, but I won't be able to help because of my current workload.\\" 4. Offer alternatives or solutions: While saying \\"no,\\" it can be helpful to suggest other options or solutions to show that you still care about the outcome. For example, \\"I can't do it right now, but maybe we can find someone else to help you\\" or \\"I won't be able to help with this specific task, but I can assist with XYZ instead.\\" 5. Be polite and respectful: Using phrases like \\"I'm sorry\\" or \\"I appreciate the offer\\" can demonstrate empathy and appreciation, even as you decline the request. 6. Practice assertiveness without aggression: Speak clearly and calmly, maintaining a neutral tone to show respect and professionalism. Avoid raising your voice, blaming, or sounding overly emotional. 7. Take time if necessary: Sometimes, it's better to gather your thoughts before providing a response. If you think you need time to decide, politely request some time to consider the request and respond later. 8. Establish boundaries: In personal or professional relationships, setting boundaries can help avoid potential conflict or resentment later on. Be clear about what you're willing and not willing to do. Remember that context, tone, and choice of words can greatly impact how your refusal is perceived. Learning to say \\"no\\" effectively helps maintain healthy relationships, manage workload, and prioritize your tasks and responsibilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds. One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position. But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals. When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food. Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack. The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, \\"If everyone is moving forward together, then... Which is the best title for the passage? A) A Bird's-Eye View of Teamwork.

Authorities with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said they believe two shootings along a remote stretch of highway are related and that the killings may be the work of someone posing as law enforcement. The revelation has since terrified Mississippi drivers, who are being urged to pull over only if they are being followed by a marked police car and to call 911 if they become suspicious. Thomas Schlender, 74, of Raymond, Neb., was found shot dead in his car on Interstate 55 in nearby Panola County on May 8. Three days later, Lori Anne Carswell, 48, of Hernando, was found dead near her car on Mississippi Highway 713 in Tunica County. Authorities announced this week that they believe Schlender and Carswell are victims of the same killer or killers. The two were shot after they pulled over on the highway, but neither vehicle appeared to have mechanical problems. \\"There are a lot of similarities, namely the fact that the shootings occurred on the side of the road,\\" Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain told FoxNews.com. Police are investigating a number of leads in the case, including a woman's claim that she was pulled over in Tate County last month by someone posing as a police officer. Tate County is located between Panola and Tunica counties, where the other two murders took place. The woman told authorities that she was being tailed by a car with a \\"white flashing light on the dashboard,\\" Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance told Fox affiliate WHBQ-TV. When the woman pulled over on the side of the highway, a man, who appeared disheveled, got out of his car and told her she was speeding, according to authorities. \\"She just did not feel comfortable, she did not roll the window down, she cracked it to talk to him,\\" Lance said. The man then asked for her driver's license, which she told him was in her purse inside the trunk. When she refused to get out of the vehicle to retrieve the bag, the man became \\"agitated\\" and \\"hit the side of her car,\\" telling her \\"just go on,\\" Lance said. The woman was unable to see the man's license plate number, but told police that he was driving a gold sedan. She said he appeared to be in his 40s and was seen wearing an untucked plaid shirt and tan pants. He also had sunglasses on, she said. \\"In light of these events, we re-interviewed her, made other agencies aware of what we had happen,\\" said Lance.

Movie plot title: Brothers Movie plot: Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) and Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal) are brothers. A Marine captain about to embark on his fourth tour of duty, Sam is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart, Grace (Natalie Portman), with whom he has two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie (Bailee Madison, Taylor Grace Geare). The film opens with Tommy being released from jail for armed robbery, not long before Sam departs for Afghanistan in October, 2007. Soon news comes that Sam's helicopter has crashed over the water, killing all of the Marines aboard. In reality, he and a hometown friend, Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger), have been taken prisoner in a mountain village. With Sam \\"gone\\", Tommy attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by wrangling old friends to help with kitchen repairs for Grace and the kids. Grace slowly sheds her previous resentment towards her brother-in-law. As months pass, Grace and Tommy bond over their mutual mourning, culminating in a passionate fireside kiss. They regret it afterward, and do not take this attraction any further, though Tommy continues to win the favor of his nieces. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are abused and tortured by terrorists, forced to make videotaped dismissals of the military and their mission, though only Joe cracks. The captors eventually deem him useless and force Sam, at gunpoint, to beat Joe to death with a lead pipe. He does so and reacts angrily. Sometime later, Sam is rescued. Sam returns home, clearly traumatized by his experience. He drifts through encounters in a cold, paranoid daze, refuses to explain to his family what happened while he was in Afghanistan, and lies to Joe's widow that he does not know how Joe died. He also believes Tommy and Grace had a sexual relationship in his absence. During Maggie's birthday party, a resentful and jealous Isabelle claims that Sam's paranoid assumptions are true: that Tommy and Grace slept together. Sam becomes enraged, destroying the newly remodeled kitchen with a crow bar and pulling a pistol on... A:","completion":"Tommy's relationship to Grace is that of a brother-in-law.

He recently lost his mother due to a sudden illness, leaving him and his father, Jack, to carry on. The relationship between Chris and Jack is strained, as Jack is focused on his work as a biologist studying the natural wildlife in the area. Chris, on the other hand, can't help but feel neglected. One day, Chris stumbles upon a hidden entrance to a large underground labyrinth beneath their house while exploring the basement. In this mysterious space, he finds strange and otherworldly-looking slugs in various sizes. Chris is both fascinated and terrified by these creatures. Act 2: One evening after dinner, Chris spots more of these bizarre slugs racing towards the basement. He quickly alerts his father, who is initially skeptical but becomes alarmed at the sight of the creatures. Jack realizes that his research may have inadvertently attracted these slugs to their home by tampering with the ecosystem. Jack and Chris reluctantly team up to investigate the slugs and discover that they evolve and rapidly grow in size when they come into contact with a glowing substance leaking from the underground labyrinth. The substance is a chemical byproduct of a secret government project that was abandoned in the 1960s. As the slugs continue to grow and spread in number, threatening to overrun the town, Chris and Jack reach out to Jack's old mentor Dr. Andrea Reynolds, an expert in alien life forms, to help find a way to stop the slugs. Act 3: Aided by Dr. Reynolds, Chris, and Jack develop a plan to neutralize the slugs by creating a formula based on the glowing substance, which will cause the slugs to disintegrate. Racing against time, they navigate the labyrinth, now infested with monstrous-sized slugs, to reach the source of the glowing substance and deploy their formula. As they battle the slugs, Chris and Jack share heartfelt conversations as they understand the need to rely on each other. In a thrilling and desperate finale, they successfully apply the formula and eliminate the slugs. However, the final showdown leaves Dr. Reynolds fatally wounded. In the aftermath, Chris and Jack grow closer as father and son, honoring the memory of Dr. Reynolds and continuing her work on researching and protecting other life forms yet to be discovered. The government takes responsibility for their past actions and seals off the underground labyrinth to ensure such an event never takes place again.

The answer to the question: Who created a textile design in 1947? is inside the article: Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism..., can you guess it ?

Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one... Produced & directed by Juan A. Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on. Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious. The kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor. Director Mas does alright, the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. The gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. It's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad. With a supposed budget of about 1,000,000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently. The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad. The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies.

This game, Super Bowl XXXVII, was held at the Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. The Oakland Raiders faced off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were led by head coach Jon Gruden, a former Oakland Raiders head coach himself. This added an intriguing storyline to the championship game. The Raiders entered the game with an impressive regular-season record of 11-5, securing the first seed in the AFC playoffs. Led by head coach Bill Callahan, the team had a powerful offensive lineup, including quarterback Rich Gannon, who was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player of the 2002 season. The Raiders' potent offense also featured wide receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, as well as running back Charlie Garner. In comparison, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a 12-4 regular season record and were the second seed in the NFC playoffs. Known for their dominant defensive unit, the Buccaneers roster boasted talents like defensive tackle Warren Sapp, linebacker Derrick Brooks, and defensive back John Lynch. One of the most notable players was cornerback Ronde Barber, who played an essential role in Tampa Bay's success that season. Despite high expectations for the Raiders, the game proved to be a one-sided affair in favor of the Buccaneers, who won with a score of 48-21. The Raiders struggled throughout the match, with their offense thwarted by Tampa Bay's crushing defense. Buccaneers' defensive back Dexter Jackson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after securing two interceptions, while linebacker Derrick Brooks and cornerback Dwight Smith each returned interceptions for touchdowns. Overall, Super Bowl XXXVII remains the last time the then-Oakland Raiders made an appearance in the championship game. Their fans continue to hope that the team, now based in Las Vegas, can recreate the success of previous years and once again compete for the coveted Super Bowl title."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A debate in the House of Lords is the last place you expect to hear someone fantasise about making love to George Clooney. But it is precisely what cheeky typist-turned-Tory Minister Tina Stowell did when she persuaded fuddy-duddy peers to back gay marriage laws. Lords Leader Baroness Stowell used Clooney to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman, not a man. For example, she told dumbstruck peers, if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her – ‘and who could blame him?’ she added coyly – Clooney’s ‘husband’ could sue him for adultery with her. Crush: Baroness Stowell, who referred to George Clooney in a debate, with a cardboard cut-out of the actor. Sure enough, a photo of Stowell alongside a life-sized cardboard cut- out of the star has pride of place in her tennis court-sized, red leather and wood-panelled Lords office, where we chatted. ‘I’ve had a soft spot for him ever since I saw him in ER,’ she says. ‘I needed to relax peers who were tense about gay marriage, so I thought, “I’ll bring in George Clooney.” ’ And fantasise about having sex with him? ‘A bit of humour helps,’ she smiles. Stowell is to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks, allowing gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ‘upgrade’ it into a formal marriage. ‘It’s important for them to say not “I’m sort of married” but that they are married,’ she says. When Stowell was made Lords Leader – a Cabinet Minister in all but name – in July, some grandees were appalled, even more than when she was ennobled three years ago. They reacted with the same haughty disdain that Downton Abbey’s Earl of Grantham showed sparky kitchen maid Daisy on learning she was studying maths instead of washing dishes. ‘Tina should be pushing the tea trolley at Cabinet, not sitting at the table,’ scoffed one, a reference to her having been PA to John Major and William Hague. In truth, ‘the Earl of Downing Street’ David Cameron had exposed her to such insults by denying Stowell full-blown Cabinet status – and £22,000 extra pay – given to her predecessor. Stowell, 5ft 1in, faced a revolt led by Baroness Betty Boothroyd, who accused the PM of ‘trampling on the constitution’. Didn’t little Tina feel cowed by all these people fulminating at her? ‘I don’t feel intimidated by anybody. I was brought up to believe I’m as good as anyone else.’ Spoken like Daisy. Stowell's doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. Stowell, 47, whose dad Dave was a painter and decorator and mum Margaret worked in a factory in the same street as their terrace house in Beeston, Nottinghamshire (‘it was posh, we had an inside loo’, she laughs) left her local comp aged 16 with five O-levels. She showed her gritty determination aged 14, landing a weekend job at a cake shop. ‘They said I couldn’t work out front until I knew the price of all 100 cakes,’ she says. ‘When I went back the next week, they couldn’t believe I knew them all.’ How much was a doughnut? ‘12p,’ she answers. ‘If I saw a big queue outside I’d try my hardest to get it down and it brought a big smile to my face when I did.’ Doesn’t it require loftier thinking to be a Cabinet Minister? She swats it away like a fly on a sticky bun. ‘The Lords may seem a million miles from the cake shop, but those people in the queue are who I think of when I do my job here,’ she says. Her cool confidence and prim porcelain glamour is a far cry from the unworldly lass mistaken for a hooker when, aged 18, she was dropped off by mum and dad at a hostel in London, for her first Civil Service job as a secretary. ‘I was stopped by a bloke who said “Are you looking for business?” I said “Sorry?” I didn’t know what he was on about. When I told the girls in the hostel, they said “Didn’t you know? This a red light area”.’ Her horizons widened with a stint at the British Embassy in Washington, and she joined Downing Street when John Major was Prime Minister. She recalls her rage when she overheard a plummy-voiced Tory sneer at ‘ignorant’ Major, unaware his loyal PA was listening. ‘The very things people criticised him for like his humble background are why I admired him. I don’t like snobs,’ she says. She formed the same bond with the next Tory leader William Hague, adding: ‘When he stepped down, I sobbed my heart out.’ But there were tears of joy when, a decade later, now a Minister with her own PA, she piloted the gay marriage laws through the Lords. ‘I was choked with happiness,’ she says. Baroness Stowell told dumbstruck peers that if Clooney married a gay man and then had a fling with her, Clooney's 'husband' could sue him for adultery with her. First she had to persuade crusty peers to take notice of someone who had never been married herself. Again she deployed her ‘friend’ George Clooney, telling the Lords bold as brass in her broad Nottinghamshire accent: ‘I’m single but as long as George Clooney is available I’m prepared to wait.’ Even peers who raged about the ‘evils of buggery’ softened. Stowell’s doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause. That was a year ago. Clooney is married now. ‘It’s his loss, there you go, no more excuses,’ she grins. She has never been short of male admirers, so why no marriage? ‘No one ever asked me!’ You have to go looking. ‘Maybe I’ll start.’ Mmm. Perhaps it is the price she has paid for her career? ‘No,’ she says firmly, ‘I don’t rule it out, though I’m probably past having children. Mum drilled it into me never to be financially dependent on a man, get a job, fend for yourself.’ The gay marriage law made her a gay icon, leading to awards from Pink News and Spectator magazine. Stowell’s, dare I say it, rather raunchy, pixie-like Twitter photo has a hint of the Judy Garland in it. She is dolled up, albeit on a budget. Her black and berry Precis Petite jacket is £79 from the suitably conservative House of Fraser. Some gay rights campaigners have speculated whether petite Stowell is gay? ‘Oh really?’ she replied. Is she? ‘No,’ she says, her bright blue bush baby eyes gleaming. And she is again quick to scotch any idea that she may never marry. ‘If a fantastic guy turned up and offered me a life better than the one I have now, why would I say no?’ she says. ‘Now George Clooney is taken, I’m back on the market.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about Baroness Tina Stowell, who used a humorous example with George Clooney to help explain the concept of adultery within gay marriage laws during a debate in the House of Lords. She wanted to relax the tense atmosphere and thought that by bringing in a bit of humor, it would help. Stowell played a crucial role in the passing of the gay marriage laws and used her charm to win over some hesitant peers during the debate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The phrase \\"to face the music\\" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. Where did the expression come from? The first information comes from the American writer James Fennimore Cooper. He said in 1851 that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their cue(,) to go on, they often said, \\"It's time to go to face the music.\\" And that is exactly what they did--- face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. So, \\"to face the music\\" came to mean having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice. The other explanation comes from the army. Men had to face inspection by their leader. The soldiers worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection?

This type of dominant pose also reduces cortisol and increases testosterone, which will add to your confidence. Take a moment to duck into bathroom stall or empty room and power pose for a minute before you need to walk confidently. Occupying more space will make you seem larger and more confident to others. Use your arms and legs to claim more of the territory around you. When you are standing, place your hands on your hips and stand with your legs about shoulder width apart. When you are sitting, lean back and stretch your legs out in front of you and rest one or both arms on the backs of the seats next to you. If there is a table or desk in front of you, you can place your arms on the table and spread them out and away from your body. A hunched appearance projects a lack of confidence. Instead, walk straight and tall to seem confident. As you walk, keep your shoulders back and lift up your chin slightly. Test your posture by holding a pencil in each hand and making a fist. Let your arms fall loosely at your sides. If the pencils face inward (towards you), then you are hunching your shoulders. Shift your shoulders back until the pencils face forward to see how your ideal posture should be while you walk. Directing your body towards the person you are talking to demonstrates your respect for them as well as interest in what they have to say, but it also contributes to an appearance of confidence. People who lack confidence may find it harder to face other people directly during a conversation. Fidgeting makes you look nervous and uncomfortable, which makes you seem like you lack confidence. Train yourself to keep still when you are standing or sitting. If you are standing, place your hands on your hips or hold something in one or both of your hands. You can hold a mug, clipboard or notepad, a pen, or something else that is appropriate for your situation. Just make sure that you don’t fidget with the object. If you are seated, firmly plant your hands on the arms of a chair or on top of a table. Just remind yourself not to tap your fingers on the table. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: Adopting a dominant power pose, such as standing tall with your arms and legs spread wide, can help boost confidence by reducing cortisol levels and increasing testosterone. Taking a moment to power pose before entering a situation where confidence is needed can be beneficial.

To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil. Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn't it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity. Spoilers ahead!!!!! Luckily for the MacGregor's, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars. The Hound. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is positive.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how much does it cost to set up hydroelectric Suggested answer: However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not directly address the question about the cost of setting up hydroelectric power. Instead, I would suggest the following answer: Setting up hydroelectric power typically involves significant initial financial investments, as the process includes dam construction or other types of infrastructure, equipment procurement, and installation, among others. The overall cost for a hydroelectric project can vary widely and depends on factors such as the project's scale, location, and complexity. Also, local regulations and environmental policies can impact the costs. Small-scale hydroelectric projects, such as micro-hydro and small-hydro systems, generally have lower costs, ranging from 1,000 to 8,000 per kilowatt (kW) installed capacity. Medium and large-scale hydroelectric projects, on the other hand, can have costs ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 per kW installed capacity. While the initial investment is relatively high, the operational and maintenance costs for hydroelectric power plants tend to be lower compared to other power generation methods. Additionally, hydroelectric power is a renewable and clean source of energy, which can provide social and environmental benefits in the long run. Keep in mind that these cost estimates may not cover every single factor, and individual project costs can vary. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the project's environmental impact, as mentioned in the original answer, along with any potential community displacement or other social consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: How would you describe Sasha? Possible answers: that she has let her boyfriend down, a sneaky person, that she has betrayed her boyfriend Answer:","completion":"Sasha's decision to send Alex a message despite being in a relationship with her current boyfriend can be painted in several lights. Although the question provides a few possible answers—implying that she has let her boyfriend down, is sneaky, or has betrayed her boyfriend—it is difficult to pinpoint exactly which of these characterizations is correct without comprehensive knowledge of the situation. However, we can still analyze Sasha's behavior through the lens of these possible answers and come to a nuanced conclusion. Firstly, we can discuss the possibility that Sasha has let her boyfriend down. This characterization suggests that she has negatively impacted her boyfriend by not meeting his expectations for loyalty and commitment. It implies that she has disappointed him, imparted a sense of failure, and possibly damaged their relationship. While this may be true, it is important to remember that we do not know the contents of the message or the nature of their relationship. If, for instance, the message was innocent and friendly rather than suggestive and inappropriate, it may be that she has not let her boyfriend down at all. Secondly, we can consider the characterization of Sasha as a sneaky person. This implies that she is intentionally covert and deceitful in her actions, specifically to avoid getting caught. This suggests that she is knowingly engaging in behavior that her boyfriend would disapprove of or that goes against the boundaries of their relationship. If Sasha is indeed being sneaky, it is important to recognize that such behavior can ferment distrust and harm relationships. However, once again, we do not know the specifics of their relationship and the extent to which her communication with Alex infringes on its boundaries. Finally, we can examine the idea that Sasha has betrayed her boyfriend by sending Alex a message. Betrayal is a powerful term and implies a breach of trust, an emotional wound, and a violation of expectations. To characterize her behavior as betrayal, we would have to assume that her boyfriend would consider her actions with Alex to be unacceptable and disloyal. Furthermore, it would imply that the message carried a certain level of intimacy or emotional weight that would be considered inappropriate given the existing relationship. While this may be true in some contexts, it is essential to consider various factors such as the message's content, her communication frequency with Alex, and her boyfriend's reaction. In conclusion, without a thorough understanding of the situation and the dynamics between Sasha, her boyfriend, and Alex, it is difficult to definitively declare Sasha's behavior as one of the given characterizations. It is possible that she has let her boyfriend down, acted sneakily, or betrayed her boyfriend, but there may also be more context and nuance to the situation than we are aware of. To accurately describe Sasha, it is crucial to gather more information and evaluate her behavior considering the specific boundaries and expectations that exist within her relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the first question: \\"I want to get into the export business.

Here is a news article: Getty Drudge: 'Hillary Clinton’s brain in a jar' could get elected The American people are \\"sick\\" and \\"willing to be made over in the image of corporations,\\" Matt Drudge said in a rare interview with InfoWars' Alex Jones published Tuesday evening. Not only that, but the powers that be could \\"put Hillary Clinton’s brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she would be elected.\\" The media needs to wake up and do its job before that happens, he said. Story Continued Below \\"If your calling is media, fine, if your calling is sports, whatever it is, but you've got to be the greatest you can be now, now, before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar, 'cause that's what we're getting,\\" Drudge said. At the start of the segment, Jones said Drudge had surprised the Austin, Texas-based show with his appearance but only his voice is present throughout the 46-minute video, standing behind the camera holding a microphone. Drudge tore into Clinton at parts of the interview, calling her \\"old\\" and \\"sick\\" and only a contender because the media are making her so. \\"They're making her a contender with these propped-up 'Saturday Night Live' things. It's like a head on a stick,\\" he said. \\"She is not a viable, vibrant leader for this country of 300-including the illegals-380 million Americans. So the media is trying to put us asleep. You're not letting them, Alex.\\" Drudge also decried a \\"cover-up\\" on \\"seeing Hillary's lovers\\" and a variety of \\"so many issues that are suppressed on a daily basis.\\" “Where I’ve had a lot of success is I’m getting people from both sides of the aisle. They’ve always said, ‘Oh, he’s a right-wing gossip monger,’ mainly because of Lewinsky and those years–which, by the way, are back,\\" he said. On the Democratic candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who turned 74 in September, Drudge wondered aloud if Democrats could \\"find anybody under the age of 70.\\" \\"What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?\\" he asked. Drudge also talked about the success of his website in sharing and spreading stories with a greater reach than Facebook or other social-media platforms, which he called \\"bogus.\\" \\"It's just a lot of gnats, a lot of confusion. The reality of the situation is life on Earth has not changed. We need facts, we need events, we need specifics on things. Not all this confusion. It’s almost, they’ve made the Internet over in their image, these corporations,\\" he remarked, \\"and I think they’re failing.\\" Drudge also hinted that because of forthcoming court rulings on copyright, his site's days might be numbered. He recounted an exchange with an unnamed Supreme Court justice who he says told him, \\"Matt, it's over for you. They’ve got the votes now to enforce copyright law. You’re out of there. They’re gonna make it so ... you can’t even use headlines.\\" \\"Wait until these copyright laws work their way up, and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.

But I’m talking about the future. \\"So I don’t know why they’ve been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams — these instas. This is ghetto. This is corporate. They’re taking your energy. They’re taking your energy and you’re getting nothing in return. Nothing,\\" Drudge said. \\"Ultimately, it’s boring, and the kids are always off to something new. Except for the something new is owned by the same freakin' company or financed by the same banking system.” ||||| Matt Drudge, one of the most influential people in the news business, gave a rare interview — to a self-identified libertarian radio host — on Tuesday. The reclusive founder of the Drudge Report spoke with Infowars' Alex Jones on Jones' namesake radio show. And for a full 45 minutes, the two addressed a wide range of topics while Drudge sat off-camera. Among other things, they talked about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the broader 2016 presidential race, the corporatization of the media landscape, world-government conspiracies, and the future of humanity. Some of the highlights are below. Hillary Clinton Drudge, who busted open the Lewinsky scandal, apparently thinks there's a media cover-up of another Clinton sex scandal. \\"They've always said, 'Oh, he's a right-wing gossip-monger,'\\" Drudge said of his critics. \\"Mainly because of Lewinsky and those years — which by the way, are back. Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers? Excuse me, why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers? Where's the cover-up on this?\\" He also argued that Clinton was not physically healthy: You've got to be the greatest you can be now — now! — before this country is so completely altered and we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar. Because that's what we're getting: She's old and she's sick. She's not a contender. They're making her a contender with these propped-up 'Saturday Night Light' things. It's like a head on a stick. But he predicted she would still win: How sick are the American people right now? I've been saying they could put Hillary Clinton's brain in a jar in the Oval Office and she'd be elected. People are really sick. I think you know this deep in your soul, and this is why you get demoralized here on this very set. People are sick. While he warned about the future Clinton administration: Hillary Clinton with the NSA? Good luck if you dissent. Good luck if you dissent. [Edward] Snowden, I'll switch places with you: You can come over here and rot in hell, because that's what it's going to be. The 2016 race Drudge name-checked a few other presidential candidates throughout the discussion, including real-estate mogul Donald Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont): Trump comes along, says a few things — just a few things! — and soars to the top of the list. That's profound. Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who were saying a lot. And I know Cruz and Rand and all the rest ... Where it's going to end up, I don't know. I'm very pessimistic — I'm very pessimistic — on this race because I'm just not sure it's not going to end up with the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office once known as Hillary Clinton. He further complained that the Democrats weren't offering any top-tier candidates who were relatively young: Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70? What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century? So I don't know. I'm hoping for surprises. I'm hoping for some jolts. We'll have to see. Social media Drudge was clearly not a fan of Twitter and Facebook: I'm not on Facebook. I don't do the socials. I've got that little Twitter thing — even that's kind of disgusting. ... I'm just warning this country that yes, don't get into this false sense that you are an individual when you're on Facebook. No, you're not. You're a pawn in their scheme. He also slammed \\"meaningless\\" tweets as a distraction from more important news events: In the beginning, they were dismissing the internet. They were pooh-poohing it … Now they make it over in their image. Now it's these endless, monotonous tweets. Meaningless — meaningless! — to me. It's just a lot of gnats, a lot of confusion. When the reality of the situation is life on earth has not changed. We need facts. We need events. We need specifics on things. Not all this confusion. Corporate influence over the media One of the most consistent themes of the interview was Drudge's dystopian view of the media landscape: Drudge [Report], to me, when I look at it right now is a correction to this groupthink. There's no difference from any of these websites. You go up and down — we talk about this — what's the difference between the websites? Between a Slate or a Salon or a BuzzFeed or a HuffPo — what is the difference? There isn't any! And this is travesty. It's almost like a weird conglomerate of groupthink that has developed in a dynamic era that should be vibrating. Drudge claimed to have talked to a Supreme Court justice who said the high court had the votes to rule against news aggregators like him: They're getting ready for these decisions to come. You thought Obamacare was shocking? You thought some of these other decisions were shocking? Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board. Then that will end for me. Fine, I've had a hell of a run. The future of humanity Jones directly asked Drudge whether, in his heart, he felt that humanity was going to \\"make it the next 100 years.\\" Drudge answered affirmatively but then mused about what natural disasters or the government could do to prevent that: Of course — unless Mother Nature decides. I'm a big fan of letting Mother Nature decide some of this too. We can't control a lot of this. There is a law to the universe. There just is. There's just a law to the universe. We could have the San Andreas [Fault] rip tonight … Will we survive? I'm sure we will. Will we be not allowed to speak as we are today? Well, we'll have it documented that we were allowed to speak that way once. So I don't know. Am I optimistic? For myself, personally, yes I'm strong. There's not much they can do. They could laser beam me, they could drone me, they can plutonium me, they could do whatever they wanted. But spiritually, I'm set. Watch below: ||||| Conservative media entrepreneur Matt Drudge gave a very rare public interview on Tuesday in which he lashed out at Hillary Clinton, mainstream media and the uniformity of American culture in the digital age. The exchange provided a glimpse into the mind of one of the most influential yet reclusive figures in American political media today. In a rambling, wide-ranging discussion with Alex Jones, a radio show host and conspiracy theorist, Drudge admonished \\"the sickness of the American people,\\" who he said were forfeiting individual thought and becoming slaves to Internet companies. Blind to the realities of the current political situation, Drudge said voters were now likely to install \\"Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar.\\" The founder of the Drudge Report also called Clinton \\"old and sick,\\" and blamed the media for covering up stories about extramarital affairs. \\"Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?\\" Drudge asked Jones. \\"Why aren't we seeing Hillary's lovers?\\" Related: Fox News sees 'no need' for Trump meeting The nearly 45-minute rant oscillated wildly between familiar critiques of the establishment and paranoid conspiracy theories with little basis in reality. At one point, Drudge suggested that the Obama administration came up with the name \\"ISIS\\" -- for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -- because it sounded like the last name of Rep. Darrell Issa, the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Drudge also refused to appear on camera for Jones' live stream, his disembodied voice issuing pronouncements, Wizard-of-Oz like, from beyond the void. \\"You're playing in Google's Hell pit!\\" Drudge said of people who used various digital and social media services, instead of creating their own individual platforms on the Internet. \\"The Internet is what you make of it.\\" Drudge has wielded immense influence over American political media for two decades. In 1995, he launched The Drudge Report, a simple webpage that aggregates the day's news under sensational headlines, often fueling conservatives' worst fears about the left, the media and, at times, the decline of American civilization. The Drudge Report's obituary has been written many times by members of the mainstream media, and yet Drudge Report always reasserts its influence. The site draws more than 2 million unique viewers a day and remains the No. 1 site for referrals to political news sites. Getting \\"Drudged\\" -- that is, having your story linked to by Drudge Report -- remains one of the most coveted goals for media organizations seeking web traffic.

Jackson faced the threat of secession by South Carolina over what opponents called the \\"Tariff of Abominations.\\" The crisis was defused when the tariff was amended, and Jackson threatened the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States. Jackson, regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy struggle, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the party \\"spoils system\\" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly relocated most members of the Native American tribes in the South to Indian Territory. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and disease. Jackson opposed the abolitionist movement, which grew stronger in his second term. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a \\"most favored nation\\" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the Napoleonic Wars, and recognized the Republic of Texas. In January 1835, he survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president.

They have also made extensive use of a variety of computer based sequencers, software synthesisers, and other applications as a means of controlling those synths and processing the synthesised sounds. Much of the hardware and software they use has been customised by the band themselves.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that the money-hungry man engaged to? from the following article ? The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply. Before the return to his time, Thibault decides to protect Julia from her money-hungry fiance, Hunter.

But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant.

(CNN) -- Hurricane season will soon be upon the Caribbean -- a time of year when storms and strong winds lash many of the islands so popular as vacation destinations for travelers across the world. Currently, however, a different tempest is raging between two neighboring countries over something far more trivial, but no less volatile -- soccer. Haiti and Jamaica are the latest nations to become embroiled in an unseemly spat that was born on the football field but quickly escalated to dominate and strain diplomatic channels. Not in doubt is the fact that Haiti's under-17 team had their dream of reaching the soccer World Cup crushed after being forced to withdraw from a qualifying tournament hosted by Jamaica. As soon as the OPTIONS: - CNN contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Caribbean contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haiti contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haitian contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Haitians contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - Jamaica contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. - World Cup contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved.","completion":"- Haitian contingent landed back on home soil, the crisis escalated and both governments became involved. The Haitian under-17 team, feeling humiliated and disappointed by their withdrawal from the qualifying tournament, was warmly welcomed by their nation upon their return. The emotional reaction back in Haiti fueled the ongoing tension between the two neighboring countries as people rightfully questioned the decisions made by Jamaica. In an attempt to reduce the mounting strain on diplomatic channels, a series of meetings were arranged between top officials from both Haiti and Jamaica. These meetings were aimed at discussing the issue and finding solutions to prevent such unfortunate events from occurring in the future. After several intense discussions, the officials agreed on implementing a series of measures to prevent such situations from arising in the future. Firstly, the establishment of a joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee would focus on improving cooperation and communication between the two nations when it comes to organizing and conducting soccer tournaments and events. Secondly, both governments decided that strengthening cultural ties between the two countries would help in reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and promoting a more collaborative and friendly atmosphere during competitions. This would be achieved through cultural exchange programs and events, bringing people from both nations together in an effort to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for each other's cultures and backgrounds. Lastly, Jamaica agreed to compensate the Haitian soccer team for their financial losses incurred due to their forced withdrawal from the qualifying tournament. Acknowledging their part in the unfortunate events, Jamaica also expressed its support for Haiti's soccer development by offering resources and training opportunities to Haitian teams. As time passed, the implemented measures began showing positive results. The joint Haitian-Jamaican soccer committee started functioning smoothly, and various recommendations were made to enhance match regulations and improve the overall soccer experience for players, officials, and spectators alike. The cultural exchange programs and events successfully bridged the gap between residents of both countries and nurtured an environment of friendship and mutual respect. This eventually led to a reduction in tension between the two governments and created a more collaborative atmosphere in different areas, including sports. A few years later, as another hurricane season approached the Caribbean, Haiti and Jamaica stood together in unity and partnership, weathering the storms, both literal and metaphorical, and proving the power of collaboration and understanding in overcoming even the most trivial of differences. In the end, both countries were able to turn a volatile and unfortunate situation into a learning experience and an opportunity to strengthen friendship, cooperation, and solidarity. The lasting positive effects of these efforts, both on and off the soccer field, continued to flourish and serve as a shining example of how sports can transcend borders and unite nations in a common cause."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The actress who portrayed the character of Mrs. June Monsoon, also known as Mother, in the television series 'Absolutely Fabulous' is June Whitfield. June Rosemary Whitfield was a renowned English radio, television, and film actress who worked in the British entertainment industry for several decades. Born on November 11, 1925, in Streatham, London, June Whitfield began her acting career in the late 1940s. She rose to prominence through her work on radio, partnering with comedians Tony Hancock and later, with Terry Scott for the show \\"Happy Ever After\\" and \\"Terry and June.\\" 'Absolutely Fabulous,' often abbreviated as 'Ab Fab,' was a British television sitcom created by Jennifer Saunders. The show originally aired on BBC from 1992 to 1996 and was later revived for a few more seasons from 2001 to 2004. Additionally, some special episodes were also made between 2011 and 2012. The sitcom is centered around the lives of the highly eccentric Edina Monsoon, played by Jennifer Saunders, and her outrageous best friend, Patsy Stone, played by Joanna Lumley. In 'Absolutely Fabulous,' June Whitfield starred as June Monsoon, Edina's unassuming and often bewildered mother. The character is quite different from her daughter and has a more modest and traditional outlook on life, often trying to make sense of Edina's and Patsy's wild and erratic behavior. June Monsoon provides a humorous contrast in the series and reveals the stark generational gap between her age group and her daughter's. Across the years, June Whitfield received critical acclaim for her role in 'Absolutely Fabulous,' and the show itself became a cult classic. Whitfield contributed to the show's immense success, and her performance as June Monsoon went on to become one of her most memorable roles in her prolific career. June Whitfield passed away on December 29, 2018, leaving behind a legacy of exceptional performances and a successful career in the British television, radio, and film industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal and can no longer sustain the walls of Tartarus which are crumbling, and the imprisoned Titan Kronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the doctor that commented on a symphony written by a man who based it on works of a 13th century poet? is inside the article: Rachmaninoff's choral symphony The Bells reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his Spring Symphony—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, \\"the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means.... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view.\\"The gestation of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with \\"A Career\\" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: \\"'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity\\". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled \\"Das Siegeslied\\" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly chromatic martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet Rumi..., can you guess it ?

Q: In this task you will be given a passage and a yes/no question based on the passage. You should answer the question using the information from the passage. passage: Once the nest has been built the male will begin courting the female, usually in the afternoon or evening. He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth. Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs, which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again. If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours, and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Dwarf gouramis have a fecundity of about 600 eggs.(1) Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest.The male will protect the eggs and fry. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch, and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free swimming and leave the nest. When the fry are two to three days old the male should also be removed or he may consume the young. question: can male and female dwarf gouramis live together? A:","completion":"Yes, male and female dwarf gouramis can live together. According to the passage, when a nest is built, the male will court the female. They will swim in circles together under the bubble nest, and the female will signal when she's ready to spawn. They will then release and fertilize the eggs, which float up into the nest. This process shows that male and female dwarf gouramis live and interact together during the breeding process."},{"prompt":"In this task, you need to output 'Yes' if the given number is a prime number otherwise output 'No'.

For a snakebite from a venomous snake, keeping your cat calm and quiet is the best first aid that you can administer to your cat before she receives veterinary care. The more agitated and active she is, the more quickly the venom could spread through her body and make her even sicker. It is actually recommended that keeping your cat calm and quiet is the only first aid that you should administer on your own. Do not allow your cat to walk or run around as this will increase her heart rate and stimulate more blood circulation. Keep in mind that your cat may snap at you or try to bite you because of the amount of pain that she’s in. Gentle pressure will help control the bleeding from the bite wound. An example of first aid that you should not administer is cutting the wound open to suck out the venom or drain the wound. Not only is this ineffective, you would cause more pain and suffering for your cat. In addition, the venom could be venomous to you. Do not apply a tourniquet or compression bandage in the area near the bite wound. Do not apply ice to the bite wound. The ice does not slow the spread of the venom and can actually damage the skin. Do not wash the wound if the bite was from a venomous snake. Washing the wound could increase the absorption of the venom. The action most likely to save your cat's life is getting her to your veterinarian as soon as possible. If possible, transport your cat in her carrier or a large box in which she can comfortably lie down. To help keep her calm and still during the drive to the veterinarian, loosely wrap your cat in a large towel or sheet. The effects of snake venom are usually irreversible and often begin immediately after the snakebite. To increase the chances of your cat’s survival and treat the effects of the snake venom, your cat will need immediate veterinary treatment. Your veterinarian may have a snakebite detection kit, which would allow him or her to identify what type of snake bit your cat. However, in the event that your veterinarian does not have the kit, you will need to provide as much information as you can about the snake bite, such as a description of the snake, how much time has passed since the snakebite, and what clinical signs your cat started to show after being bitten. Although clinical signs and the appearance of the snakebite may seem like enough to start treatment, your veterinarian will want to run diagnostic tests to fully assess the severity of the snakebite. For example, your veterinarian will run blood tests to see how well (or poorly) your cat’s blood is clotting. He or she may also take a urine sample (snakebites can lead to blood being in the urine). Depending on how well-equipped the veterinary clinic is, your veterinarian may want to perform an electrocardiogram to assess your cat’s heart beat. Because of how quickly snake venom can spread and cause damage in your cat’s body, your veterinarian may want to begin some forms of treatment immediately to stabilize your cat. Do not be surprised if your veterinarian needs to start treatment to stabilize your cat before he or she gets a more detailed history from you. One form of immediate treatment is intravenous fluids, which will bring your cat’s blood pressure back up (very important if your cat has gone into shock). Antivenin works by neutralizing the snake’s venom and is most effective when administered within the first six hours of a snakebite. It can help to prevent bleeding disorders and reduce the amount of swelling at the bite wound. Keep in mind that antivenin is not a vaccination and will not protect your cat from future snakebites. Your veterinarian will likely administer a steroid, which will minimize further tissue damage, control shock, and prevent a possible allergic reaction from antivenin administration. Steroids are usually given only in the first 24 hours after a snakebite. Your cat may also need oxygen supplementation and additional breathing support, depending on her level of respiratory distress when you get her to your veterinarian. If your cat is suffering from serious blood circulation problems (little to no clotting, low blood cell counts), she will need to be treated with blood replacement products and other appropriate treatments. Antibiotics are usually not necessary, since wounds from snakebites rarely become infected. The prognosis for your cat varies depending on how much venom was injected, the species of snake, and how time has passed since the snakebite happened. Fortunately, nearly 80% of pets will survive snakebites if they receive immediate veterinary treatment. Provided that your cat has a good prognosis, she will likely recover in 24 to 48 hours. This recovery may take longer (at least several days) depending on the extent of tissue damage. Your veterinarian may recommend that your cat stay at the hospital overnight for an observation. She would need stay overnight if she needs continued intensive treatment. Once your veterinarian is confident that your cat has recovered well from the snakebite, he or she will send her home with you. When your cat is well enough to come home, you will need to be responsible for her at-home care. Your veterinarian will probably prescribe a pain medication to control the pain from the snakebite. Your cat may need additional medications, depending on her clinical signs and results of the diagnostic tests. Summary:","completion":"In summary, the best first aid for a snakebite in your cat is to keep her calm and quiet, and get her to a veterinarian as soon as possible. Do not attempt to cut the wound, suck out the venom, apply a tourniquet, or use ice. At the veterinary clinic, your cat will need immediate treatment, such as intravenous fluids and possibly antivenin and steroids. Diagnostic tests will be run to assess the severity of the snakebite and monitor your cat's heart and blood condition. Oxygen supplementation and additional treatments may be necessary, depending on your cat's condition. Your cat's prognosis will depend on several factors such as the amount of venom injected, the species of snake, and the time since the snakebite. Most pets will survive if they receive prompt veterinary care. Recovery will take 24 to 48 hours or longer, with some cats needing to stay overnight at the hospital. Follow your veterinarian's instructions for at-home care and medications once your cat is well enough to come home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cancer Bats are a Canadian hardcore punk band from Toronto, Ontario. They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band. The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows. On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores. The album includes guest vocals by George Pettit of Alexisonfire. On June 7, 2006 they hosted All Things Rock, a show on MTV Canada, and had their own video played at the end of the show.

He was born in Lwów, Poland (now Ukraine). Żuławski often went against mainstream commercialism in his films, and enjoyed success mostly with European art-house audiences. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Żuławski's films were only shown in European art-houses.","completion":"While the statement that \\"Żuławski's films were only shown in European art-houses\\" may suggest a limited context, it is essential to provide a more detailed and long answer to best exhibit Andrzej Żuławski's career, the reach of his films, and their reception in different regions. Andrzej Żuławski was a prolific director and writer known for his distinctive approach to storytelling, often exploring themes of emotional turmoil, interpersonal relationships, politics, and existentialism. His films were marked by their intense visuals and often provocative narratives, which led to a unique and controversial cinematic identity. This characteristic made his work simultaneously complementary and challenging to European art-house audiences, who were engaged in exploring unconventional cinema. Although Żuławski's success was primarily seen in European art-house circles, it is not accurate to say that his films were \\"only\\" shown in European art-houses. His work had an international presence, and it was appreciated by cinephiles and critics across multiple continents. Some of his most notable films, such as \\"The Third Part of the Night\\" (1971), \\"The Devil\\" (1972), \\"Possession\\" (1981), and \\"The Silver Globe\\" (1988), garnered both acclaim and criticism around the world. In fact, \\"Possession\\" was not only screened and received awards at the Cannes Film Festival, but also gained notoriety in the United States and the United Kingdom due to its graphic content, which led to it being labeled as a \\"video nasty\\" in the UK. This instance, along with other international screenings of Żuławski's films, demonstrates that his work was not confined solely to European art-houses. Furthermore, the advent of home video and digital streaming platforms has allowed for a wider audience to access Żuławski's films, introducing them to viewers who might not necessarily attend art-house screenings. As his work becomes more readily available and easier to discover, the notion that his films were exclusively shown in European art-houses becomes increasingly outdated. In conclusion, while Andrzej Żuławski’s films found significant success with European art-house audiences, it would be inaccurate to imply that they were restricted exclusively to these venues. His films have been screened and appreciated in varied settings around the globe, and their accessibility has continued to grow in the digital age, reaching an ever-widening audience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don’t give up easily.\\"","completion":"Title: The Power of Assertive Communication: Making Decisions, Working Hard, And Never Giving Up Introduction At the core of human interaction lies communication - a fuel that drives relationships, success, self-expression and overall human understanding. Effective communication encapsulates a balance of assertiveness, empathy and focused listening. Assertiveness stands as a pivotal element that shapes our daily decisions, drives our will to work harder, and propels us to persevere in the face of challenges. This article aims to delve into the concept of assertive communication, the steps towards making assertive decisions, the importance of hard work, and the strength of resilience. Assertive Communication Assertive communication is a skill rooted in the balance of respect for oneself and for others. It is the ability to speak up for oneself, express one's ideas and feelings openly, respectfully, and directly, without infringing on the rights of others. Remember, being assertive isn't about being aggressive or self-serving, it's about being honest and direct, sticking up for what you believe while considering and respecting others' points of view. Making Assertive Decisions Assertive decision-making is a significant aspect of assertive communication. It helps in developing a mindset that mitigates indecisiveness and enhances confidence. This process starts by acknowledging one's ability to make decisions and upholding the responsibility for their consequences. Data gathering and evaluation play a key role in assertive decision-making. Thoroughly understanding the implications, pros, and cons of each option is vital. It empowers individuals to make well-informed, assertive decisions that align with their values and goals. Working Hard Once a decision has been made, turning the decision into action requires hard work. Working hard is the process of dedicating time, effort, and resources to achieve a set goal. With a firm decision in place, the path becomes clearer, but the journey demands perseverance, commitment, and hard work. Hard work often involves stepping out of comfort zones, embracing new learning opportunities, and maintaining a degree of flexibility and adaptability. It's more about being smarter in the how, what, and when of work than merely increasing the hours worked. Hard work also entails understanding one's strengths and weaknesses and capitalizing on them effectively to improve productivity. Don’t Give Up Easily The journey to any worthwhile achievement is often fraught with challenges. Despite well-informed decisions and hard work, stepping stones may appear as stumbling blocks. The phrase 'Don't give up easily' rings a bell in such instances. Resilience is an ingredient that should never be overlooked. With it, setbacks are merely setups for grand comebacks. Embracing mistakes as learning opportunities, maintaining a positive mindset, continuously aiming for self-improvement, and never losing sight of the ultimate goal, are all elements of the 'never give up' principle. Conclusion Assertive communication, astute decision-making, commendable hard work, and relentless resilience all combine to forge formidable characters and successful individuals. It's about placing value on oneself, making informed decisions, committing to the actions necessary to effect those decisions, and never allowing any form of setback to dampen one's spirit. In a nutshell, mastering these attributes won't just result in achieving success; they will cultivate a deep-rooted, enduring growth mindset, setting a path of lifetime accomplishments. This journey transforms not just oneself, but also paints a canvas of inspiration for others to follow. Remember, it starts by speaking up, deciding wisely, working diligently, and never backing down at the first or even subsequent hurdles. The world always makes way for the man who knows where he is going and isn't afraid to assert it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - Itchen Valley is a civil parish in the English county of Hampshire. - Uppark is a 17th-century house in South Harting, Petersfield, West Sussex, England and a National Trust property. - Eastbourne is a large town, seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of East Sussex on the south coast of England, east of Brighton. Eastbourne is immediately to the east of Beachy Head, the highest chalk sea cliff in Great Britain. With a seafront consisting largely of Victorian hotels, a pier and a Napoleonic era fort and military museum, Eastbourne was developed by the Duke of Devonshire from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries. - An escarpment is a steep slope or long cliff that forms as an effect of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually \\"escarpment\\" is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian \\"scarpa\\", shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where \\"escarpment\\" refers to the margin between two landforms, while \\"scarp\\" is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face.This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle(dip) slope on one side and a steep (scarp) slope on the other side. - Beachy Head is a chalk headland in East Sussex, England. It is situated close to Eastbourne, immediately east of the Seven Sisters. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - The South Downs National Park is England's newest National Park, having become fully operational on 1 April 2011. The park, covering an area of in southern England, stretches for from Winchester in the west to Eastbourne in the east through the counties of Hampshire, West Sussex and East Sussex. The national park covers the chalk hills of the South Downs (which on the English Channel coast form the white cliffs of the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head) and a substantial part of a separate physiographic region, the western Weald, with its heavily wooded sandstone and clay hills and vales. The South Downs Way spans the entire length of the park and is the only National Trail that lies wholly within a national park. - Hampshire (; abbreviated Hants, archaically known as the County of Southampton) is a county on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The county town of Hampshire is Winchester, the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous ceremonial county in the United Kingdom (excluding the metropolitan counties) with almost half of the county's population living within the South Hampshire conurbation which includes the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. The larger South Hampshire metropolitan area has a population of 1,547,000. Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force.

Given the question: Article: Today we bring you an old tale. It's the story of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf that blew down a house made of straw and one made of sticks. The only house left standing was the one made of bricks. Now there is new evidence to suggest that houses built with bales of straw can be very strong. They are also very environmental. Pete Walker is a professor at the University of Bath in Britain. He and a team of researchers there have built a house made out of straw bales and hemp material. During the next twelve months the team will study the effectiveness of these materials in home building. Professor Walker says there are many good reasons for using straw. Professor Walker: \\"One of the benefits is it's a relatively inexpensive renewable material that's readily available.\\" He also agrees that straw takes in carbon dioxide as it grows and helps the environment in other ways. So it can be seen as having no harmful effects on the environment. Professor Walker: \\"The straw bale walls are relatively thick and so all that straw provides very good thermal insulation. So we make buildings that require very little heating in the winter or indeed very little cooling in the summer. So they require very little additional energy.\\" Professor Walker says this reduces home operating expenses. It also reduces the effect on the environment. He says the current interest in straw bale houses is a direct response to the problem of climate change. David Lanfear owns an eco-friendly home building service in the United States called Bale on Bale Construction. He says he laughed when some friends first told him about houses built of straw. But after doing his own research, he learned that building with straw bales made a lot of sense. He has now helped to build more than ten straw bale houses and says the building material is becoming more widely accepted. To build the houses, he fills a wood frame with tightly packed bales of straw. Next he coats the walls inside and out with layers of clay plaster. He says the common ideas...

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this.

Would \\"Tycho Brahe (14 December 154624 October 1601), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"While your provided information about Tycho Brahe is correct, it does not fully answer the question of where he was when he discovered Mars. Tycho Brahe was an influential Danish astronomer known for his accurate and comprehensive observations of the celestial bodies during the late 16th century. In order to provide a more detailed answer to the question, let us first clarify the concept of \\"discovering Mars.\\" Mars, through human history, has been largely visible to the naked eye due to its bright red appearance. It could be seen as far back as ancient civilizations, and its discovery cannot be attributed to any particular individual, including Tycho Brahe. However, Brahe made significant contributions to our understanding of Mars by observing and recording its positions with unprecedented accuracy, which helped with the development of early scientific theories on the celestial bodies' movements. Tycho Brahe conducted his astronomical observations primarily from two locations. The first was his observatory and castle, called Uraniborg, built on the island of Hven, which is a part of modern-day Sweden. The second was his observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou in the Kingdom of Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. As far as his observations of Mars are concerned, Tycho started making detailed measurements of its position in the night sky during his time at Uraniborg in 1576. Over two decades, Brahe observed and documented Mars' positions, which gained significant importance in proving the accuracy of his instruments and producing an extensive body of astronomical data. To provide a more fitting answer to your question, while Tycho Brahe did not \\"discover\\" Mars in the traditional sense, his critical observations of the planet took place primarily at his observatories on the island of Hven and later in the Kingdom of Bohemia. His work laid the foundation for the groundbreaking work of Johannes Kepler, who used Brahe's observations to develop his laws of planetary motion, which helped pave the way for modern astronomy and our current understanding of the solar system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These two sentences do not mean the same thing, although they both discuss Ronnie Biggs, one of the notorious Great Train Robbers. There are significant differences in the information conveyed by each sentence. The first sentence states that Ronnie Biggs was fighting for his life after suffering a massive heart attack. This suggests that he was in a critical condition and faced a life-threatening event due to the heart attack. The primary focus is on the severity of his health situation and the potentially fatal consequences. The second sentence, on the other hand, informs us that Ronnie Biggs was back in jail after being treated for pneumonia in a hospital. Here, the emphasis is on his recovery from pneumonia and his subsequent return to jail. Although pneumonia can be a serious health issue, it is not explicitly mentioned whether his life was in danger, unlike the first sentence, which specifically highlights the severity of the heart attack. In conclusion, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. While both sentences involve Ronnie Biggs and his health issues, the focus of the first sentence is on the life-threatening nature of the heart attack, whereas the second sentence emphasizes his recovery from pneumonia and his return to jail.

Firstly, the initial statement provides minimal information about the appearance of the person. It does not mention their attire, specifically a beige jacket and a helmet, which are both mentioned in the second statement. Therefore, we cannot assume these details based on the provided information. Secondly, the mode of transportation is different between the two statements. In the original statement, the person is described as walking to the store with empty shopping bags. Conversely, the second statement describes a person riding a bicycle with filled bags on each handle. A direct correlation between these two scenarios cannot be established without additional context or information. It is worth noting that the given statement only describes the person walking to the store, while the mode of transportation returning from the store is not specified. Additionally, the description of empty shopping bags in the initial statement does not necessarily imply that they will be filled at the store. However, even if we were to assume that the shopping bags would be full upon return, it would still be impossible to conclude that the person would be riding a bicycle, given the information provided. Lastly, the two statements imply different timings. The initial statement depicts a person walking to the store, presumably prior to shopping. On the other hand, the second statement portrays a person riding a bicycle, presumably after shopping, with filled bags on each handle. Connecting these two situations directly would be inaccurate without further information or context to link them. In conclusion, based on the given statement, \\"A person walks to the store with empty shopping bags,\\" it is not possible to conclude that \\"A person wearing a beige jacket and a helmet is riding a bicycle with a filled bag on each handle.\\" The information provided in the initial statement is insufficient for making such a conclusion, as it lacks details about the person's appearance, mode of transportation, and the sequence of events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times. I never looked up, because I couldn't stop crying.Each hand looked different, and many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything. I couldn't look up. I wasn't able to say thank you. I went on to have an amazing year studying in England, but that was the last time I saw or spoke to any of my uncle's family.

Premise: \\"um-hum and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uh-huh\\" Hypothesis: \\"The Cadillac is at least five years old.\\" In the premise, there are a few expressions, \\"um-hum\\" and \\"uh-huh\\", which are colloquialisms that generally indicate agreement or affirmation. The key information provided in the premise is that the Cadillac is definitely a used car. This means that the car has been previously owned and is not new. The hypothesis suggests that the Cadillac is at least five years old. This statement refers to the age of the car, proposing that it is a minimum of five years old. Now, to determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, it is important to assess if the information provided in the premise necessitates the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, can we conclude that the Cadillac car must be at least five years old based on the information stating that it is definitely a used car? The simple fact that the Cadillac is a used car does not entail that it must be at least five years old. A used car could be any vehicle that has been previously owned or driven, regardless of its age. There is a wide range of possibilities for the age of a used car, from just a few months old to several years or even decades old. The premise only confirms the car is used and does not specify or imply a particular age or range of ages. Considering this, the hypothesis that \\"The Cadillac is at least five years old\\" is not entailed by the premise stating that the Cadillac is definitely a used car.

He always stayed at my side until the children were born, and then he became their guardian , too. When he passed away, my heart broke. I was sure I would never love another dog as much as I loved him. I was wrong again. We got the next one when the children were little. When he played with the children, he made them laugh.

Not only the monstrous anger of the guns nor the stuttering rifles’ rapid rattle, but now an epic four-minute, eye-wateringly expensive commercial for a supermarket chain. There is no disputing that the new Sainsbury’s ad is, on its own terms, a masterpiece. The cinematography is breathtaking. Without saying a word, the young cast conveys a startling array of emotional depth within a few short minutes. The simple narrative, built around the near-mythical Christmas truce between the trenches of 1914, has just the right blend of poignancy and sentimentality to bring a tear to the most cynical eye. So why does the advert leave me feeling so unsettled, so uncomfortable, even a touch nauseous? The first answer has to be that for all the respectful tone, the centennial occasion and the endorsement of the Royal British Legion, the ultimate objective here is to persuade us to buy our tinsel, our crackers and our sprouts from one particular supermarket. Perhaps the greatest truism, even cliche about the first world war is that nobody ever really understood why it happened, what it was all about. Those in the trenches never understood what they were giving their lives for, beyond a vague commitment to king and country, and a hundred years later most of us still don’t really understand. The sheer futility of the slaughter is what made the truce possible and also what makes the recounting of the tale so heartwarming and heartbreaking to this day. That vacuum of sense provides all the more reason for caution when co-opting the events for a purpose as crass as flogging groceries. Of course many film-makers, writers and other artists have made good money from representing the horrors of war. Some do so with respect and artistry, some exploit shamelessly. But there is a key difference, I would suggest, between selling representations of war as a product, and using representations of war as a means to another end. Somewhere close to 40 million young men were killed, lost or mutilated in the first world war. Sainsbury’s has all but dressed them in a sandwich board. Donating profits to the Royal British Legion from the sale of the special chocolate bar that appears in the advert doesn’t change that. In helping to launch the ad today, the legion’s head of fundraising praised the film’s historical accuracy and attention to detail. How true can this be? While there were certainly varying conditions on the frontline from place to place and year to year, reading contemporary accounts from either side of the trenches, in the poetry of Owen and Sassoon or the prose of Remarque, the details that stick in the mind are horrific. Nowhere in the new advert do we see the blood and entrails, the vomit and faeces, the rats feasting on body parts. The response might be “well they can hardly put that in a Christmas advert can they?” and that would be entirely true. Which is why the scene is entirely inappropriate for a Christmas advert in the first place. The trench warfare of 1914-18 sits near the top of the list of horrors that humanity has inflicted upon ourselves and each other. Although it has recently slipped out of the range of living memory, it remains an iconic scar. Like the Nazi Holocaust or the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan, it lives on as a vivid phantom in our culture, a constant reminder of our capacity to inflict incomprehensible degrees of violence and suffering upon innocent individuals. It surely behoves us as a society to retain those deaths with respect and a degree of reverence. Would we welcome an advert next Christmas showing a touching little scene between a Jewish child and a disabled child in Auschwitz, swapping gifts for Christmas and Hanukah on their way to the gas chambers? I would hope not, yet I fail to see any great moral difference. Exploiting the first world war for commercial gain is tasteless. This, however, is not what disturbs me most. The really upsetting details are the stunning shot of the robin on the wire, the actors’ trembles as they cautiously emerge from the trenches, half expecting a sniper’s bullet, the flicker of understanding in the eyes as the young soldiers reach into their pockets at the end. The film-makers here have done something to the first world war which is perhaps the most dangerous and disrespectful act of all: they have made it beautiful.

John Owen Brennan (born September 22, 1955) was the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from March 2013 to January 2017. He served as chief counterterrorism advisor to U.S. President Barack Obama; his title was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to the President. His responsibilities included overseeing plans to protect the country from terrorism and respond to natural disasters, and he met with the President daily. Previously, he advised President Obama on foreign policy and intelligence issues during the 2008 presidential campaign and transition. In April 2012, Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. In his speech he explained the legality, morality, and effectiveness of the program. The ACLU and other organizations disagreed. In 2011-2012, he also helped reorganize the process, under the aegis of the Disposition Matrix database, by which people outside of war zones were put on the list of drone targets. According to an Associated Press story, the reorganization helped \\"concentrate power\\" over the process inside the White House administration. In June 2011, Brennan claimed that US counter-terrorism operations had not resulted in \\"a single collateral death\\" in the past year because of the \\"precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop.\\" Nine months later, Brennan claimed he had said \\"we had no information\\" about any civilian, noncombatant deaths during the timeframe in question. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism disagreed with Brennan, citing their own research that initially led them to believe that 45 to 56 civilians, including six children, had been killed by ten US drone strikes during the year-long period in question. Additional research led the Bureau to raise their estimate to 76 deaths, including eight children and two women. According to the Bureau, Brennan's claims \\"do not appear to bear scrutiny.\\" The Atlantic has been harsher in its criticism, saying that \\"Brennan has been willing to lie about those drone strikes to hide ugly realities.\\" According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Brennan's comments about collateral death are perhaps explained by a counting method that treats all military-aged males in a strike zone as combatants unless there is explicit information to prove them innocent. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did the Drone program continue?","completion":"Based on the quote from the article: \\"In April 2012, Brennan was the first Obama administration official to publicly acknowledge CIA drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and elsewhere,\\" it can be inferred that the drone program did continue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Information: - Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria found in various environments that forms colonies composed of filaments of moniliform cells in a gelatinous sheath. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Glomeromycota (informally glomeromycetes) is one of seven currently recognized divisions within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 230 described species. Members of the Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) with the roots or thalli (e.g. in bryophytes) of land plants. \\"Geosiphon pyriformis\\" forms an endocytobiotic association with \\"Nostoc\\" cyanobacteria, and is the only member of the Glomeromycota known not to form arbuscular mycorrhiza in association with plants. AM formation has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are symbionts with land plants (\\"Nostoc\\" in the case of \\"Geosiphon\\") for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence. The arbuscular mycorrhizal species are terrestrial and widely distributed in soils worldwide where they form symbioses with the roots of the majority of plant species (>80%). They can also be found in wetlands, including salt-marshes, and associated with epiphytic plants. - An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (plural \\"mycorrhizae\\" or \\"mycorrhizas\\", a.k.a. \\"endomycorrhiza\\", \\"AM fungi\\", or AMF) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the roots of a vascular plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures, arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. AM fungi help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants. - The Diversisporales are an order of generally hypogeous ( underground ) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi within the division Glomeromycota . Many have vesicles for energy storage , or auxiliary cells . Species produce a wide range of spore types , hence the name . - Bryophyte is a traditional name used to refer to all embryophytes (land plants) that are non-vascular plants, namely the mosses, hornworts, and liverworts. The defining features of bryophytes are that their life cycles are dominated by the gametophyte stage, that their sporophytes are unbranched and that they do not have a true vascular tissue containing lignin, although some have specialized tissues for the transport of water. Bryophytes are usually considered to be a paraphyletic group and not a natural (monophyletic) group, although some studies have produced contrary results. Regardless of their status, the name is convenient and remains in use as an informal collective term. Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they produce neither flowers nor seeds, reproducing via spores. The term \\"bryophyte\\" comes from Greek , \\"bryon\\", \\"tree-moss, oyster-green\\" + \\"phyton\\" \\"plant\\". - A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, such that it takes on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem. The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique hydric soil. Wetlands play a number of roles in the environment, principally water purification, flood control, carbon sink and shoreline stability. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. What entity does 'diversisporales' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.

Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia. He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19. Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.

Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split.

Question: Process: - Food enters the small intestine - The small intestine produces hormones - The hormones cause the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion - The enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through tubes - The enzymes help the intestines digest the food - The pancreas produces the hormones insuline and glucagon - The hormones control the amount of sugar in the blood. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose not as much of the water will be able to be heated happens, how will it affect the pancreas working HARDER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context is not directly related to the pancreas or its functions. However, to give a comprehensive response to this, we must first understand the process mentioned and examine any potential indirect effects of the perturbation on the pancreas. The process described is related to the role of the small intestine and pancreas in digesting food and regulating blood sugar levels. Here is a summary of the process: 1. Food enters the small intestine, where it is broken down further. 2. The small intestine produces hormones in response to the presence of food. 3. These hormones signal the pancreas to produce enzymes for digestion. 4. Enzymes travel from the pancreas to the small intestine through ducts. 5. Enzymes help digest food in the small intestine. 6. The pancreas also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. 7. Insulin and glucagon control the amount of sugar in the blood. Now, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that \\"not as much of the water will be able to be heated.\\" Without further context or clarification, we can interpret this statement as a general reduction in the availability of an optimum water temperature for performing certain bodily functions. Still, it is not directly related to the pancreas or its enzymatic and hormonal production. However, let us consider some potential indirect effects of this perturbation on the pancreas. 1. Reduced water temperature could affect the body's overall hydration and thermoregulatory processes. This could lead to a series of compensatory physiological changes, which might indirectly cause the pancreas to work harder to maintain homeostasis within the body. 2. If the temperature of the ingested food is affected by the reduced water temperature, it might become more challenging for the small intestine and the pancreatic enzymes to break down the food effectively. In this case, the pancreas might need to produce more enzymes to compensate for the decreased efficiency of digestion. Despite these considerations, it remains unclear how the perturbation hypothesis could specifically cause the pancreas to work harder. The pancreas primarily functions to support the digestive system and maintain blood sugar levels. It is not directly involved in the processes of heating water or regulating an organism's body temperature. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation does not have a direct effect on the process of food digestion and blood sugar regulation involving the small intestine and pancreas. Although there may be some indirect effects resulting from reduced water temperature, the exact impact of such a perturbation remains speculative and uncertain without more context and information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The 17-month-old had Down syndrome and three holes in his heart. The only mercy he could have received would be losing parents like these. A Louisiana father and mother are accused of poisoning their infant son who had Down syndrome with hand sanitizer, rum and perfume in what's now being described as a mercy killing. Erika Wigstrom's 17-month-old son had a blood-alcohol level of 0.280 — more than three times the state's legal driving limit — when he died on Jan. 24, an autopsy report found. Deputies say the 20-year-old Belle Chasse woman confessed this week to having administered Germ-X, an ethyl alcohol solution, in his feeding tubes the day before he died. \\"God called upon Lucas to don his angel wings and return back to his forever home while cradled in the arms of his beloved mother,\\" the child's obituary read. Wigstrom, who additionally confessed to feeding the infant perfume, defended that both she and the child's father simply didn't want their son to suffer anymore, according to the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder?\\" is in \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\".

For non-preferred groups, such as poor white people, working harder may prove futile because affirmative action policies may provide advantages to preferred groups, even if they are more fortunate (e.g., upper and middle class blacks).

We usually put half her meal in her food bowl and half in the Wobbler and it has definitely slowed her down. She definitely has fun trying to get her food out, although we don't have as much fun listening to her kick it around and into walls for 30 minutes, I guess it's worth it if she's happy! We'll probably end up buying her a special bowl to slow her down to we don't have to listen to the banging (she gets realllly into trying to get that food out) but she still enjoys the Wobbler so we'll keep it in use.The opening is big enough to get her food out, but her food has large chunks (Purina One) that get stuck, so she pushes it around into walls and furniture until we open it to help get her food out. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light. The reviewer highlights the effectiveness of the Kong Wobbler in slowing down their dog's eating, and mentions that their dog, Lucy, enjoys using the toy. However, there are a couple of minor negatives mentioned - the noise created by Lucy pushing the Wobbler around, and the larger chunks of food occasionally getting stuck. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, and the review seems to endorse the product's utility and entertainment value for their dog."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a question about this article: John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household: the Chancery kept written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer dealt with income and expenditure respectively; and various judges were deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom. Thanks to the efforts of men like Hubert Walter, this trend towards improved record keeping continued into his reign. Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went. John was very active in the administration of England and was involved in every aspect of government. In part he was following in the tradition of Henry I and Henry II, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, which put much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style. John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, which made his rule more personal than that of previous kings, particularly in previously ignored areas such as the north. What is the answer to this question: Who dealt with income and expenditure?","completion":"The Treasury dealt with income and the Exchequer dealt with expenditure.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E.

White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The Van de Graaff Generator Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity—they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.38 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits. Q: Practical limits of van de graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually do what to surrounding materials? Choices: - displace - isolate - decompose - ionize A: Answer:","completion":"Ionize Explanation: In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that \\"practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials.\\" Hence, the correct choice is ionize."},{"prompt":"Information: - Stony Stratford (often shortened to Stony) is a constituent town of Milton Keynes (in north Buckinghamshire, England) and is a civil parish with a town council within the Borough of Milton Keynes.

Summarize this article: Aloe has remarkable natural healing properties and is a great natural remedy to use on unwanted sunspots. If you’re using a cream, apply a generous amount to the skin of your face, arms, and other sunspot-afflicted areas once in the morning and once in the evening. If you’re using the leaves of an aloe plant, squeeze the pith out from a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section and smear it directly onto your sunspots. Look for aloe vera gels at health-food stores or in homeopathic medicine sections. Large pharmacies may also carry aloe vera gel. Look near the sunscreen and other skincare products. If you’d prefer just to purchase an aloe plant, look at a large plant nursery. Vitamin E has been proven to help lighten dark spots on the skin, including unwanted sunspots. Swallow 1 vitamin E tablet in the morning and 1 more at night to help lighten sunspots. Or, add vitamin E to your diet by upping your consumption of foods rich in vitamin E. These include foods like citrus fruits, papaya, spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes You can purchase both vitamin E oral tablets and liquid gel at a large pharmacy or drugstore. Cut 1 large lemon into quarters and hold a lemon section against your sunspots for 10–15 minutes per day. Lemons are mildly acidic, and the acid in the fruit aids in lightening dark sunspots. You’ll begin to notice that your sunspots are visibly lighter after about 2 months of daily use. Rather than throwing away the sections of lemon that you don’t use each day, store them in a plastic bag in your refrigerator and use them the next day. Daily lemon application can also help to remove any dead skin cells from your face, arms, and shoulders. Take a sharp kitchen knife and chop 1 large red onion up into 6-8 large chunks. Pick up 1 of the onion chunks and rub it across a dark sunspot for about 30 seconds. The acid in the onion helps to lighten up the dark color of sunspots. Because the onion’s acid is relatively weak, you’ll need to continue the home treatment for months before you see much of a result. Summary:","completion":"Aloe vera has natural healing properties that can help reduce sunspots by applying aloe cream or aloe leaf pith directly to the affected areas twice a day. Vitamin E can also contribute to lightening sunspots by taking tablets or increasing consumption of vitamin E-rich foods. Additionally, using lemon sections and red onion chunks can assist in lightening sunspots due to their mild acidic content. For effective results, these treatments need to be carried out consistently over several months."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Tanya was looking forward to this gathering, as she had spent the past week contemplating what to wear and whom she might meet while there. Felicia, on the other hand, had no obstacles in her path and was able to go without any problems. Leading up to the day of the party, Tanya had experienced a particularly hectic week at work. Several high-priority projects landed on her desk, requiring her to put in extra hours to meet the tight deadlines. Despite her fatigue, Tanya vowed to attend the party as a way to let off steam and unwind with her friends. The day of the party arrived, and Tanya was determined to join the festivities. However, as she was getting ready, she realized that she could not find the chic outfit she had meticulously planned out days prior. After searching her wardrobe from top to bottom, Tanya discovered that her perfect party attire had inadvertently been mixed in with a pile of donations she had dropped off at a local charity earlier that week. Disappointed but undeterred, Tanya decided to wear another dress she found in her closet. As she prepared to leave, she suddenly received a call from her younger sister, who informed her that their mother had been involved in a minor car accident and needed Tanya's assistance to deal with the aftermath. Tanya was relieved to learn that her mother was not seriously injured, and she immediately rushed to her side. While Tanya tended to her mother's needs, Felicia was enjoying the lively atmosphere at the party. She mingled with friends and acquaintances, savoring the appetizers and drinks that flowed throughout the evening. Felicia felt a twinge of guilt, knowing that Tanya would have loved being there, but she understood that family responsibilities sometimes trumped social engagements. As the night wore on, Tanya helped her mom settle back into her home and ensured that she had everything she needed. She tried to keep her spirits up, even though she knew she had missed an opportunity to de-stress and reconnect with friends like Felicia. After saying goodbye to her mother, Tanya headed home, deciding to order some takeout and have a quiet night in. In the end, Tanya, but not Felicia, had to miss the party because life threw Tanya a curveball in the form of work stress, a lost outfit, and a family emergency. While she would have much preferred to let loose and enjoy herself with her friends, Tanya knew that sometimes such sacrifices were necessary to deal with these urgent matters. Thankfully, Felicia could still attend and help bring back stories and memories to share with Tanya, giving her a glimpse of the lively soiree that she could not experience firsthand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner.

John had to remove the computer virus from the program because the","completion":"system had been compromised, and the performance of the network had significantly declined. To thoroughly make sure all traces of the malware were erased, John took several precautions and followed a series of steps. Step 1: Disconnect the infected computer John first disconnected the infected computer from the internet and any other networks to prevent the further spread of the virus throughout the system. He justified this action by ensuring that the malware couldn't exfiltrate sensitive data or infect other devices on the network. Step 2: Boot the computer in Safe Mode After disconnecting the computer, John booted it up in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode of operation that only loads the most basic and essential files. This allowed him to minimize the risk of unwittingly running the virus while trying to remove it from the system. Step 3: Identify the malware and its location Using his knowledge of programs and networks, John carefully examined the system logs and the list of running processes to identify any suspicious files and their locations. He consulted online databases for known viruses and compared this information with what he found on the infected computer. Step 4: Disable system restore In some cases, malware can take advantage of the computer's system restore feature. As a precautionary measure, John disabled the system restore to reduce the chances of the virus reactivating itself after its removal. Step 5: Use a malware removal tool John then selected a reputable malware removal tool, which he installed on a clean, uninfected USB drive. He plugged the USB drive into the infected computer and ran the malware removal tool, allowing it to scan and clean the computer. John justified using a specialized tool, as they are designed to detect and eliminate malware. Step 6: Run a thorough antivirus scan After the malware removal tool completed its task, John ran a thorough antivirus scan on the entire system to double-check for any remaining traces of the virus. He ensured that the antivirus database was up-to-date to maximize its effectiveness in detecting and eliminating any potential threats. Step 7: Re-enable system restore and create a restore point Once John was confident that the malware had been effectively removed, he re-enabled the system restore feature and created a new restore point. This action would allow him to restore the computer to a malware-free state in case of future issues. Step 8: Monitor the system Finally, John carefully monitored the system for signs of abnormal behavior or performance issues. He kept an eye on the logs and the status of the antivirus software to ensure that there were no reappearance of the virus or other malware infections. Through these eight steps, John successfully removed the computer virus from the program, restoring the performance and security of the network. By acting promptly and methodically, he prevented significant damage and potential data loss, ensuring the swift return to normal operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Different colors: The information provided only tells us about a female dancer wearing a red dress, but in the scenario described, we have one dancer in white and another in green — there is no mention of a red dress. The female dancer wearing a red dress could be a completely separate individual or not relevant to the situation described. 2. Missing details: The information about the female dancer in a red dress does not include any other details such as the type of dance she is performing, the location, or whether she is dancing with a partner. Therefore, the connection between this dancer and the detailed scene description cannot be established based on the given information. 3. Ambiguity in the term \\"dancer\\": The term \\"dancer\\" is vague, as it could apply to various types of dances, like ballet, contemporary, or even social dances. On the other hand, the detailed scenario specifically describes ballet dancers. The connection between the female dancer in a red dress and the ballet dancers cannot be inferred without further information specifying that the female dancer in a red dress is also a ballet dancer. 4. Background inconsistency: There is no mention of a columned building or the dancers performing arm-in-arm in the information about the female dancer wearing a red dress. Without any additional background information about the female dancer in a red dress, it is not possible to establish a relationship between her and the described scene.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go. I started really living again instead of just existing. But when April 2 came this year, I found that I was back in my memories. It was easier to deal with this time because of the way I had changed over the last year. I hung around with more friends and they helped distract me and one actually helped me turn May 2 into a celebration. And I love her for that. That's my story.

Like a real mouse!\\" he remarks). When he hears signing coming from what appears to be a gift-wrapped bird cage and sees that it is labeled for Granny, he switches the tags. Granny gives the cage to Sylvester and opens the box with the rubber mouse. Believing it to be a mix-up, she goes to give Sylvester his box and correct the mistake, but once she sees a satisfied Sylvester hiccup Tweety's feathers, she immediately gets wise and makes the cat spit up the bird. After a thorough scolding, Granny insists that Sylvester kiss Tweety under a sprig of mistletoe, but the now-sulking cat eats Tweety again, leading to another forced regurgitation. Granny places Tweety's cage on a pole where she thinks Sylvester won't be able to reach it, but the cat is determined to get at his meal. On his first attempt, Tweety points out a huge present waiting under the Christmas tree, labeled for Sylvester. Sylvester immediately runs to the package to open it with relish, only to find it is Hector the Bulldog, who promptly eats Sylvester. Granny immediately forces Hector to spit out Sylvester and drags him out of the room.

Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap.

In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Historically, Melungeons were associated with the Cumberland Gap area of central Appalachia, which includes portions of East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and eastern Kentucky. Tri-racial describes populations thought to be of mixed European, African and Native American ancestry. Although there is no consensus on how many such groups exist, estimates range as high as 200. According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which Virginia incorporated into law in 1662, children were assigned the social status and ethnicity of their mother, regardless of their father's ethnicity or citizenship. This meant the children of African slave mothers were born into slavery. But it also meant the children of free white or mulatto women, even if fathered by enslaved African men, were born free. The free descendants of such unions formed many of the oldest free families of color. Early colonial Virginia was very much a \\"melting pot\\" of peoples, and some of these early multiracial families were ancestors of the later Melungeons. Each family line has to be traced separately. Over the generations, most individuals of the group called Melungeon were persons of mixed European and African descent, whose ancestors had been free in colonial Virginia. Edward Price's dissertation on Mixed-Blood Populations of the Eastern United States as to Origins, Localizations, and Persistence (1950) stated that children of European and free black unions had intermarried with persons of Native American ancestry. These conclusions have been largely upheld in subsequent scholarly and genealogical studies. In 1894, the U.S. Department of the Interior, in its \\"Report of Indians Taxed and Not Taxed,\\" noted that the Melungeons in Hawkins County \\"claim to be Cherokee of mixed blood\\". The term Melungeon has since sometimes been applied as a catch-all phrase for a number of groups of mixed-race ancestry. In 2012, the genealogist Roberta Estes and her fellow researchers reported that the Melungeon lines likely originated in the unions of black and white indentured servants living in Virginia in the mid-1600s before slavery became widespread. They concluded that as laws were put in place to prevent the mixing of races, the family groups could only intermarry with each other. They migrated together from western Virginia through the Piedmont frontier of North Carolina, before settling primarily in the mountains of East Tennessee.

Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Ok\\" The answer is:","completion":"Determining an exact star rating for a review based solely on the word \\"Ok\\" is not entirely possible due to the lack of context and the unclear nature of the word itself. However, I will attempt to provide an analysis and possible range of star ratings that can be associated with this review. 1. Interpretations of \\"Ok\\": - \\"Ok\\" can be interpreted in different ways. It could mean that the person found the product or service to be mediocre, not particularly good or bad. It could also be an indifferent response, representing the user's inability or unwillingness to articulate their experience in depth. 2. Possible star ratings: - Taking the interpretations above into consideration, \\"Ok\\" could potentially be associated with 2 different star ratings: a) ★★☆☆☆ - Two stars: If the reviewer meant that the product or service was mediocre, then a two-star rating may be appropriate. It indicates that the product or service is below average but not the worst possible option. b) ★★★☆☆ - Three stars: If the reviewer felt indifferent towards the product or service, a neutral three-star rating might be fitting. It signifies an average experience - not great, but not particularly bad either. 3. Factors to consider: - If additional context or reviewer's history is available, this information could be used to further refine the star rating. For instance, if the reviewer has a pattern of leaving brief, undetailed reviews, then the single word \\"Ok\\" might not be an accurate representation of the actual rating they intend to give. Alternatively, if their other reviews are detailed and only this one is brief, it may provide more insight into how the reviewer might rate the experience. In conclusion, based on the vague nature of the word \\"Ok\\" in this review, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact star rating. However, considering the possible interpretations and factors, a rating between ★★☆☆☆ (two stars) and ★★★☆☆ (three stars) could be the most likely range for this review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The leader of the Indian independence movement was Mohandas Gandhi. He was born into a Hindu family. As a young man, Gandhi studied law in London. The Hindu leaders had threatened to punish him. But he went to London anyhow. Gandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy. He was willing to be punished for his actions. Gandhi thought that the law would be changed if enough people protested in this way. It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs. Gandhi wanted all Indians to understand the independence movement. He walked barefoot through the villages, speaking to all people. Many people loved and understood Gandhi. His movement grew. The British flag came down in 1947. The Indian people honored Gandhi with the title Mahatma, which means \\"Great soul\\". Gandhi was an unusual kind of leader. He promised never to make money for himself. He always wore simple clothes and sandals. He was shot and killed in 1948. At his death, he owned little more than a few clothes, his eyeglasses, a book, and his rice bowl.

Strauss-Kahn had secret flat in Paris to hide group sex from wife, court hears Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, has told a court how he rented a luxury flat in Paris under an acquaintance’s name because he was married and wanted somewhere discreet to meet women for group sex. Strauss-Kahn is on trial for alleged “aggravated pimping” – aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women – and could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted. While leading the IMF in Washington, he allegedly had group sex with prostitutes specifically brought to him in Europe and the US, organised by French businessmen friends at his instigation. He strongly denies knowing the women were prostitutes and maintains he thought they were just “swingers”, like himself. He denies all pimping charges. Related: Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s pimping trial: who’s who The judges in Lille focused on the apartment in a smart area of Paris because if Strauss-Kahn had made a private flat available for prostitution, this would fall under the crime of aiding and abetting prostitution. Strauss-Kahn said private “swingers’ evenings” took place at the flat and that he was always present and participating, but insisted he was not the organiser of those evenings. He has denied knowing, or suspecting, that there were any prostitutes or paid women at those events. People who were at the events told the court they had not sensed the presence of any prostitutes. Asked by a judge why the flat was rented under an opaque setup, Strauss-Kahn said: “I was a politician, I was married. I needed a discreet place to meet politicians, and to meet young women I wanted to meet.” The judge questioned Strauss-Kahn over a large number of text messages exchanged between 2009 and 2011 with his businessman friend, Fabrice Paszkowski, who is accused of recruiting paid women for group sex with him. In one message in 2009, Strauss-Kahn asked Paszkowksi if he wanted to accompany him to a “magnificent” swingers club in Madrid and bring “material” – meaning women. Strauss-Kahn had told the investigation that the term “material” was unfortunate and ill-chosen, but that in other text messages he had referred to women by name and that there was no mention of prostitutes. Paszkowski denies the charges and has told the court Strauss-Kahn did not know any women he introduced him to were paid. Earlier this week, the court heard two women break down in tears describing how they were subjected to a sex act by Strauss-Kahn that they had not wanted or agreed to. One said the ex-IMF chief had known of her distress but had smiled and gone ahead “with force”. Strauss-Kahn told the court he had not been aware of the women’s “refusal” and was sorry they viewed the events that way. “I’m not for doing things that are disagreeable for partners,” he said. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of the text are as follows: 1. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is on trial for alleged \\"aggravated pimping\\" - aiding and abetting the prostitution of seven women. He could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted. 2.

Both sentences mention that reactance is the imaginary part of electrical impedance, indicating that it is an essential aspect of understanding electrical impedance. The first sentence states that the reactance is \\"equal, but not generally analogous to reversing the susceptance.\\" Here, \\"reversing the susceptance\\" is a bit vague and may leave the reader with some confusion about the relationship between reactance and susceptance. However, the important aspect of this sentence is that they are not generally analogous, which communicates that reactance and susceptance are related but distinct concepts. The second sentence is more clearly structured and explicitly states the relationship between reactance and susceptance. In this sentence, the reactance \\"is equal but not generally analogous to the inverse of the susceptance.\\" By using \\"inverse of the susceptance,\\" the sentence is more specific and educates the reader about the mathematical relationship between the two concepts—that is, that they are equal but not generally analogous.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The USO: Entertainment, Technology, and Support for US Troops Overseas Introduction: The United Service Organizations (USO) has been at the forefront of providing entertainment, support, and technology to American troops stationed overseas for decades. Though one might instantly think of Bob Hope when mentioning the USO, the organization extends its services well beyond iconic performances by famous comedians. From offering wholesome entertainment to facilitating communication with loved ones back home, the USO plays a pivotal role in boosting morale for US military personnel. Bob Hope and the USO Connection: Bob Hope, a legendary comedian and actor, had an enduring partnership with the USO that spanned five decades. With his performances, he brought laughter and cheer to American troops far away from home during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and other conflicts. While the USO is often associated with Bob Hope, its impact extends beyond his shows and has evolved over the years to suit the needs of the modern military. The USO's Offering Technology and Support: As technology has advanced, so has the USO's ability to provide comprehensive support to troops abroad. Among its many initiatives, the USO has set up internet connectivity in its centers, allowing service members to access emails, social media, and communication platforms to stay in touch with their family and friends thousands of miles away. In addition, the USO offers counseling services and resources to help military personnel navigate challenges faced during their time away. Entertainment for Soldiers Abroad: One of the primary missions of the USO is to provide quality entertainment for troops overseas. To achieve this goal, the organization has brought numerous artists, musicians, actors, and comedians to perform for military personnel in active-duty zones. One memorable occasion was when Stephen Colbert's \\"Colbert Report\\" was filmed in Iraq in 2009. The USO played a crucial role in arranging this landmark event, transporting Colbert and his team to the war-torn country, and providing a much-needed distraction for soldiers on the front lines. A Key Figure in Military Morale: The USO has consistently worked towards easing the burden and hardships that come with deployment by ensuring service members feel connected to their homeland. Through entertainment, technology, and support, the USO has helped uplift the spirits of millions of American troops stationed overseas. While Bob Hope might be a symbol of the USO's impact, the organization's work is a testament to its unwavering commitment to these brave men and women. Conclusion: The role of the USO goes beyond providing entertainment and technology for troops overseas, encompassing broader support and care initiatives. As military personnel continue to face the challenges of serving their nation away from home, the USO's dedication to improving their quality of life serves as a vital and appreciated resource."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show.

They hope he will be all better soon to play the game against another team called \\"Chelsea.\\" The good news is, they have a plan. Our striker friend is going to Egypt for warm-weather training. Warm-weather means it's sunny, and the temperature is perfect to be outside. Have you ever been to Egypt? It's full of pyramids and camels! Egypt is warm, and sometimes playing soccer in warm weather helps soccer players feel better and stronger. So let's imagine our striker friend running around in the sun, training in Egypt, and slowly getting better. He will practice lots and get his strength back. United's friends are waiting for him, and they know he will soon be ready to join them again and play football. One day, our England striker friend will feel good and strong again. He will be back with his team, United, to face Chelsea in an exciting game. When that day comes, we will all watch the game and cheer for our favorite striker friend. And remember, you heard this exciting story here first!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Article: \\"I'd be better off dead.\\" he said, without any hesitation . Hearing those words come out of my best friend's mouth tore my heart apart. He has repeated that phrase more than once, and my mind continually plays it over like a voice recording. I met him about three years ago. After knowing me for six months, he told me about his struggles with depression . Sadness was not the only feeling that came over me; I was shocked. He seemed so outgoing and happy all the time. I soon learned that he was hurt physically and mentally as a young child, causing him to have the thought of killing himself. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. However, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak. Therefore, when it comes to helping him, convenience is not in my vocabulary. It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, for he always comes first. Many students at his school laugh at him when they notice scars on his arms from cutting. As he sees it, other kids have every right to make fun of him. But no one holds such a right, so I encourage him to ignore the heartless kids who treat him badly. When he feels the weight of judging eyes or hateful voices, I always remind him that I care about him unconditionally. Just hearing me say I will always be his best friend seems to give him the safety he needs to keep on going. My best friend once told me that if he had not had me, he would not be alive. He said that my encouraging words helped him not to take his life. Our friendship has taught me that a single kind word can influence someones life. Life is not easy for every one, which makes me strongly believe in the necessity of encouragement. Question: What is the best title for the passage?

Given the question: Information: - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The England national football team represents England in international football and is controlled by The Football Association, the governing body for football in England. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - Wembley is an area of northwest London, England, and part of the London Borough of Brent. It is home to the Wembley Arena and Wembley Stadium. Wembley formed a separate civil parish from 1894 and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1937. In 1965, the area merged with the Municipal Borough of Willesden to create the London Borough of Brent, and has since formed part of Greater London. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Premier League is an English professional league for men's association football clubs. At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL; known as \\"The Football League\\" before 201617). Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify. - Wembley Stadium is a football stadium in Wembley, London, England, which opened in 2007, on the site of the original Wembley Stadium, which was demolished from 20022003. The stadium hosts major football matches including home matches of the England national football team, and the FA Cup Final. The stadium will be the temporary home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur while White Hart Lane is being demolished and their new stadium is being constructed. - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - Wembley Stadium / wmbli / ( formerly known as the Empire Stadium ) was a football stadium located in Wembley , London , England , that stood on the site now occupied by the new Wembley Stadium .

BABY FACE is one of the better of the \\"forgotten\\" films before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored. Stanwyck is living in East St. Louis (where she may have known the drunken parents of \\"Myra\\" - Mae Clarke - in WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in the restored dialog) he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old. Now she is resident waitress and part-time whore in his speakeasy, her closest friend being Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant who Barrett keeps bullying. It is one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about Harris, threatening to leave if Harris is fired (and since it is the grubby workers like Nat Pendleton, who enjoy seeing Stanwyck serve them, rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in, Barrett has to obey her). The one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom Stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home. He is also pushing the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche, and the idea of the will to power. More about this later. After she knocks out the local political bigwig (Arthur Hohl), and has an argument with Barrett about this, a still explosion kills Barrett, and enables Stanwyck to leave her home town. She and Harris head to New York City, managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman (James Murray). They reach New York, and after walking about they see the Gotham Trust Company (established 1873), and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is. We slowly watch Stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but sleazier) than Robert Morse dared in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING. But Morse was a man in a man dominated company. Stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon. She goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a section of the film that I always felt was the most shocking - curiously enough - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent. Each ends up falling for her, and either being pushed aside when no longer useful, or destroyed by her. Brent, the new President of the Bank his grandfather founded, eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds). Brent is indicted. Will she stick up for him? SPOILER COMING UP: The one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings. The original ending had Stanwyck boarding a ship for Europe abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing she can't do it to him, returning to their apartment house, and finding he's shot himself. She is riding with him to the hospital as it ends. Now before the rediscovered footage was found, the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and retiring back to East St. Louis, to live happily if poor. Neither of these are good endings. Stanwyck should continue on her destructive course, with Brent the last of her victims. But even without the Breen office the script writers (one is Darryl Zanuck, by the way) saw fit to have her find a moral center. She has none - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). I don't think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion. There are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has her work cut out for her. Wood (when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him) admits that he did not want her to work. But in 2006, Stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place. In the film there are nasty, catty remarks (obviously some based on jealousy) towards Stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise. In 2006, she'd be frequently confronting women superiors, and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly. Of course, if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful. And she also never seems to meet any men who are gay. They do have gay male executives in business, who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts. Then there is her mentor, Mr Cragg. Cragg is remade in the \\"bowdlerized\\" version into trying to make her seek a moral center. In reality he pushes Nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - find your way to power and push it. While Nieztsche did stress power sometimes, it wasn't the be-all and end-all of his theories. Otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses. Cragg is obviously self-educated, but only half-educated. In short if somebody who thoroughly studied Nieztsche confronted Cragg he'd make him look like a half-educated fool.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. and a hint : According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Please answer this question : Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","completion":"Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth. This is because Neptune's orbit is larger and farther from the Sun compared to Earth's orbit. As a result, it has a longer distance to travel in its revolution around the Sun. Additionally, Neptune's sidereal period (year) is longer due to its increased distance from the Sun and the slower speed with which it travels in its orbit, as it is less affected by the Sun's gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that.

The process you've outlined describes physical or mechanical weathering, a natural geological process that breaks down rocks into smaller pieces. The missing first step should thus introduce the factors causing the start of the weathering process. Here is a potential first step: \\"The rock is exposed to external environmental and atmospheric conditions, including changes in temperature, wind, water flow (like rivers), wave action, freeze-thaw cycles, or plant and animal action.\\" Let's breakdown this process: 1. \\"The rock is exposed to external environmental and atmospheric conditions, including changes in temperature, wind, water flow (like rivers), wave action, freeze-thaw cycles, or plant and animal action\\": This step exposes the rock to the environment and sets the stage for the weathering process. The rock's exposure is significant because it allows interaction with external forces or factors causing weathering. 2. \\"The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks\\": This step represents the initiation of weathering. Particles moving against the surface of the rock gradually chip pieces off of the rock surface. This can be due to various actions such as water flow, wind, or even biological activities. 3. \\"The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks\\": This step signifies the continuance of weathering. The constant stress due to the motion of particles against the rock further breaks down its structure. This continues the weathering process, which can last for thousands and even millions of years. 4. \\"The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact\\": Over time, the continuous chipping away at the rock breaks it apart. This is a critical step in the weathering process, representing the transition from the macroscopic scale to smaller and smaller pieces that can readily be eroded. 5. \\"The pieces of the rock are now small rocks\\": This step clarifies the outcome of the weathering stage where the rock is broken apart into smaller rocks or stone fragments. 6. \\"The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces\\": The process continues even on these smaller pieces of rocks. They still get broken down further by environmental and atmospheric factors until they become tiny grains of sediment. This is how the process of mechanical or physical weathering works, starting from the exposure of rocks to the elements, to the constant wear and tear, leading to the breakdown of large rocks into tiny sediment grains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Assess clarity and coherence: The sentence is not very clear or coherent, as the relative clause \\"they never use\\" should be placed right after the noun it modifies to make it more understandable. 4.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eating less foods happens, how will it affect less steam is produced. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the initial process The initial process involves burning coal in a boiler to produce steam under pressure, which then flows into a turbine causing it to spin and ultimately generate electricity. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis In this case, the perturbation hypothesis is that eating less food occurs. It is not directly related to the initial process of producing electricity through burning coal. Step 3: Analyze if the perturbation has any direct or indirect effects on the process Direct effect: There is no direct connection between eating less food and the process of burning coal to produce electricity. The coal burning process does not depend on an individual's food consumption, so there is no direct effect on the process from eating less food. Indirect effect: It's possible to consider some indirect effects, although they may be quite remote. For example, if eating less food leads to a decrease in overall energy consumption by individuals, this might reduce the demand for electricity. If the demand for electricity decreases, there might be a reduction in coal being burned to produce electricity in the long term, which could result in less steam being produced. A: The supposed perturbation, eating less food, does not have a direct effect on the coal burning process to produce electricity. However, there may be some distant and attenuated indirect effects, such as reduced electricity demand if food consumption is linked to energy demand in households, leading to potentially less steam being produced."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jim threw out the book and read a letter instead because the","completion":"book didn't satisfy his thirst for knowledge on the topic he was seeking. He had always been an avid reader, constantly in search of new and varied information. From the time he was young, he would spend hours in the town's quaint library, devouring knowledge as if it were sustenance for his ever-curious soul. He thrived on intellectual growth and was intentional in expanding his understanding of the world. It was a warm autumn evening when Jim stumbled upon the book in question. After having spent a good portion of the day browsing the shelves of the library, he came across a dusty, forgotten-looking book tucked away in a dimly lit corner. Its faded leather cover caught his attention, and with great anticipation, he picked up the book and skimmed through its contents. The book appeared to be about a range of topics, including philosophy, science, and history. It seemed as though it could provide insights on a multitude of subjects, and with great enthusiasm, Jim decided to borrow it and take it home. That night, he settled into his favorite armchair, a steaming cup of tea by his side – the perfect setting for diving into a new literary adventure. As his eyes raced across the pages, Jim quickly realized that the book was not what he had hoped for. The information within it was outdated, its ideas were unremarkable, and the writing style seemed uninspired. Dissatisfaction quickly began to permeate his thoughts, and in frustration, he threw the book aside. However, before he resigned himself to a disappointing evening, Jim remembered an old letter that he had tucked away in a drawer – the letter he had been meaning to read for ages but had never found the time. The letter was from his grandfather, a brilliant and well-respected man who had made significant contributions in various fields of study. Excited about the prospect of gaining wisdom from his granddad's experiences, Jim carefully unfolded the parchment and began to read. The letter was dated decades ago, and the faded ink told of a legacy that still held substantial meaning today. As he immersed himself in his grandfather's words, Jim was transported to a different time and place. His grandfather recounted tales of exploration and daring feats, of intellectual pursuits, and the value of lifelong learning. The letter contained fascinating anecdotes and profound life lessons that completely enthralled Jim. It was evident that his grandfather had an insatiable hunger for knowledge, much like Jim himself. The letter painted a vivid picture of the kind of person his grandfather was – a man who challenged norms and was constantly seeking new truths in an ever-changing world. As Jim continued reading, he couldn't help but feel a deep sense of connection with his grandfather, despite the vast difference in generations. Their shared love for learning created a bond that seemed to transcend time, bridging the gap between past and present. As Jim absorbed every word, he felt inspired and grateful for the wisdom that was being passed down to him by this remarkable man who had come before him. After carefully reading the entire letter, Jim decided to spend the following weeks delving further into the subjects mentioned by his grandfather, hoping to continue their shared intellectual pursuits, even if it meant doing it in spirit. That evening, the simple act of reading a letter made Jim realize that sometimes valuable knowledge and wisdom can be found in the most unexpected places. So, as Jim continued his own journey in pursuit of knowledge, he became more mindful, pausing to value the words and experiences of those who had lived before him - like his grandfather - and cherishing the precious connections that can shape our lives and help us grow."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

Clean up after yourselves, stay out of the road and stop talking about annoying 'hipster topics'; the neighbours can hear you. A San Francisco coffee shop has laid out a set of rules for its diners that includes a ban on talking about ‘hipster’ things and who they had sex with last night, according to a local blogger's photo that captured it outside. Ironically Four Barrel Coffee, which shows overturned buckets and crates for seating on weekends along its alleged problematic alleyway, is a hipster venue itself. House rules: A posting of rules by a San Francisco coffee shop has asked their outside diners to clean up after themselves, lower their voices and not talk about annoying hipster topics. In contrast to their newly posted rules, their website sells their artisan atmosphere - featuring an assortment of coffees from Africa, Latin America and Indonesia among others - as a place you will likely hear 'a dramatic recounting of last night's scandalous activities.’ But they appear to have turned their ways, at least with the Caledonia alleyway’s neighbours in mind. As the rules go: Keep the alley clear of trash, bring dishes back inside, watch out for traffic in the alley, monitor your voice levels and lastly:. '[Don't talk] about annoying hipster topics, or who you f***** last night. You shouldn't do that anyhow, but our neighbors actually can hear you.'

Answer the above question based on the context below: In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, \\"I want to do something that I've never done before.\\" This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to work with her on her soccer training. Answer:","completion":"In the given context, after Gracie Bowen's rebellious phase and her determination to replace her brother on the varsity soccer team, it is her father who later trains the tomboy. Initially, her father does not believe that girls should play soccer and thinks that Gracie is not tough or talented enough for the sport. However, when Gracie's wild and self-destructive behavior serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father, he realizes the importance of supporting his daughter's passion for soccer. Motivated to help Gracie fulfill her dreams and overcome the challenges she faces, her father makes a pivotal decision to quit his job and dedicate his time and efforts to her soccer training. As a former soccer star himself, he has the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to guide Gracie and help her hone her soccer abilities. By training Gracie, her father not only assists her in navigating the difficulties of pursuing a traditionally male sport as a young girl but also supports her emotional well-being by becoming a pillar of encouragement and understanding. The father's decision to train Gracie signifies a change in his initial beliefs and attitude towards his daughter's ambitions, demonstrating personal growth and recognition of the importance of equal opportunities for both boys and girls. His choice to become Gracie's coach ultimately fosters a supportive relationship between them and allows Gracie to develop her soccer skills, defy gender stereotypes, and work towards achieving her goal of joining the varsity soccer team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the background: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. and the situation: Two teams of agriculturists used different methods to improve production. Team Corn used organic methods, and team Plum used gibberellins for their crops. Answer the following question: Which team stopped dormancy (resting time) of buds? The answer is:","completion":"Team Plum stopped the dormancy (resting time) of buds. Step 1: Understand the background information. In the given background, it's mentioned that gibberellins are hormones that cause plants to grow. They are used by some gardeners or horticulture scientists to increase the growth of plants. One of the functions of gibberellins is to stop dormancy of seeds and buds, signaling it's time for a seed to germinate or bud to open. Step 2: Analyze the situation. Two teams of agriculturists used different methods to improve production: Team Corn used organic methods, while Team Plum used gibberellins for their crops. Step 3: Connect the background information to the situation. Since Team Plum used gibberellins on their crops, and one of the functions of gibberellins is to stop dormancy of seeds and buds, we can infer that Team Plum stopped the dormancy of buds. Justifying the answer: Given the functions of gibberellins stated in the background and the situation where Team Plum used gibberellins on their crops, we can conclude that Team Plum stopped the dormancy (resting time) of buds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: A total of 228 people have put themselves at the mercy of the voters, and will battle it out for 90 seats split across 18 constituencies. Many eyes will be on the number of female candidates put forward by the parties, and a total of 70 are set to stand, which marks a 4% rise on last year's proportion. There were 276 candidates running in the 2016 assembly poll, which was a significant increase on the 218 who stood in the 2011 election. But directly contrasting those numbers with the figures this year would be like comparing apples and oranges, for a number of factors. Firstly, the cut in the number of assembly seats from 108 to 90 in this election will have had an effect on the amount of candidates the parties feel it is worthwhile to stand. And the short notice at which the election was called means parties have had much less time to organise and raise funding than they would for a poll during the typical five-year election cycle. That will have been a particular challenge for smaller parties and independents, and five parties that stood last time round will be absent from this year's ballot papers. The reasons mentioned will go some way to explaining why each of the larger parties have cut their overall numbers of candidates. The Democratic Unionist Party drops by six to 38 and Sinn FÃ©in goes from 39 to 34. The Ulster Unionists opt for nine fewer runners with 24, the Social Democratic and Labour Party cuts three to run 21 candidates and the Alliance Party has a reduction of two to 21. But looking at the figures a different way, each of those parties has actually increased their proportion of candidates to seats by about a couple of percent. The Green Party continues to run a candidate in every constituency. The UK Independence Party sees the largest fall in candidate numbers, with just a single name on the papers this year after running 13 in 2016. The Progressive Unionist Party drops from six to three this year, while the Citizens Independent Social Thought Alliance, which ran last year as Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol, drops one candidate and now runs four. But People Before Profit are looking to capitalise on their success last year, and have expanded their number from three to seven, while the Traditional Unionist Voice, the Conservative Party, the Workers Party and the Cross Community Labour Alternative all increase their offerings by one, to 14, 13, five and four respectively. Rounding off the list are the 22 independents, one fewer than last year's number. You can find a full breakdown of candidates by constituency at the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website.

Judith Butler FBA (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler is best known for her books Gender Trouble: Judith Butler was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust. As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her \\"first training in philosophy\\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was \\"too talkative in class\\". Butler also stated that she was \\"thrilled\\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: \\"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\\" Butler attended Bennington College and then Yale University where she studied philosophy, receiving her B.A. in 1978 and her Ph.D. in 1984. She spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright-Scholar. She taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. In 2002 she held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam. In addition, she joined the department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University as Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Visiting Professor of the Humanities in the spring semesters of 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the option of remaining as full-time faculty.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting. Which is not stated in the passage? _ .

The passage does cover the other options in the question: A) Trees can help keep enough rainwater - The passage explains that when there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water, leading to the ground drying up and turning to sand. B) More trees need to be planted - The passage suggests planting trees as a possible solution to sandstorms, encouraging readers to ask their parents to help them plant trees in the spring. C) Some people are doing harm to the environment - The passage mentions that people in northern China have been cutting down too many trees, contributing to the problem of sandstorms.

They argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised within better-off groups (such as lower-class whites and Asians).There has recently been a strong push among American states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions, in reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan joined California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations. Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive. Furthermore, opponents of affirmative action claim that these policies dehumanize individuals and applicants to jobs or school are judged as members of a group without consideration for the individual person. Question: Which court case featured an unprecedented and controversial decision?","completion":"The court case that featured an unprecedented and controversial decision is Grutter v. Bollinger. This case, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2003, involved the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy in its admissions process. The plaintiff, Barbara Grutter, a white woman, claimed that she was denied admission to the law school due to race-conscious admissions policies, which she argued violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy, ruling that race could be considered as one of the many factors in a holistic admissions review process in order to promote diversity within the student body. The Court's decision emphasized the importance of obtaining a diverse student body to achieve a richer educational experience for all students and held that achieving such diversity was a compelling state interest. The Grutter v. Bollinger case marked a turning point in the legal landscape surrounding affirmative action in higher education, as it reaffirmed the constitutionality of using race as a factor in admissions decisions under certain circumstances. This decision was both unprecedented and controversial, as it ignited significant debate over the merit, necessity, and implications of affirmative action policies in education and other areas. As a result, several states, such as Michigan, California, Florida, Texas, and Washington, have since banned the use of race or gender preferences in university admissions through legislative measures or voter-approved constitutional amendments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Pieter Cornelis \\"Piet\\" Mondriaan, after 1906 Mondrian (; Dutch: ['pit 'mondrija:n], later ['mondrijan]; 7 March 1872 - 1 February 1944), was a Dutch painter and theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements. Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. Context: When the 47-year-old Piet Mondrian left the Netherlands for unfettered Paris for the second and last time in 1919, he set about at once to make his studio a nurturing environment for paintings he had in mind that would increasingly express the principles of neoplasticism about which he had been writing for two years. To hide the studio's structural flaws quickly and inexpensively, he tacked up large rectangular placards, each in a single color or neutral hue. Smaller colored paper squares and rectangles, composed together, accented the walls. Then came an intense period of painting. Again he addressed the walls, repositioning the colored cutouts, adding to their number, altering the dynamics of color and space, producing new tensions and equilibrium. Before long, he had established a creative schedule in which a period of painting took turns with a period of experimentally regrouping the smaller papers on the walls, a process that directly fed the next period of painting. It was a pattern he followed for the rest of his life, through wartime moves from Paris to London's Hampstead in 1938 and 1940, across the Atlantic to Manhattan. At the age of 71 in the fall of 1943, Mondrian moved into his second and final Manhattan studio at 15 East 59th Street, and set about to recreate the environment he had learned over the years was most congenial to his modest way of life and most stimulating to his art. He painted the high walls the same off-white he used on his easel and on the seats, tables and storage cases he designed and fashioned meticulously from discarded orange and apple-crates. He glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio-phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well-traveled records. Visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases, but found, often to their astonishment, that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re-tacked to the walls in ever-changing relationships constituted together an environment that, paradoxically and simultaneously, was both kinetic and serene, stimulating and restful. It was the best space, Mondrian said, that he had inhabited. He was there for only a few months, as he died in February 1944. After his death, Mondrian's friend and sponsor in Manhattan, artist Harry Holtzman, and another painter friend, Fritz Glarner, carefully documented the studio on film and in still photographs before opening it to the public for a six-week exhibition. Before dismantling the studio, Holtzman (who was also Mondrian's heir) traced the wall compositions precisely, prepared exact portable facsimiles of the space each had occupied, and affixed to each the original surviving cut-out components. These portable Mondrian compositions have become known as \\"The Wall Works\\". Since Mondrian's death, they have been exhibited twice at Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art (1983 and 1995-96), once in SoHo at the Carpenter + Hochman Gallery (1984), once each at the Galerie Tokoro in Tokyo, Japan (1993), the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo (1994), the University of Michigan (1995), and - the first time shown in Europe - at the Akademie der Kunste (Academy of The Arts), in Berlin (22 February - 22 April 2007). Question: Were their exhibits in other cities? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there have been exhibits of Piet Mondrian's works, including \\"The Wall Works,\\" in other cities beyond the ones mentioned in the context. Apart from the exhibitions in Manhattan, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Michigan, and Berlin, Mondrian's works have been showcased in various museums, galleries, and exhibitions around the world, reflecting his significant contribution to the modern art movement throughout the 20th century. Some notable exhibitions of Mondrian's works held in other cities include: 1. Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, Netherlands (now called Kunstmuseum Den Haag): This museum houses the largest collection of Mondrian's works, including some of his earliest landscape paintings and the progression to his iconic grid-based compositions. The museum often hosts exhibitions of Mondrian's art, providing a comprehensive understanding of his artistic journey. 2. Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom: In 1996, the Tate held a significant retrospective exhibition of Mondrian's works entitled \\"Mondrian: The Path to Abstraction.\\" The exhibition showcased approximately 70 paintings and drawings, exploring the development of the artist's unique abstract style. 3. Centre Pompidou, Paris, France: The museum has presented several exhibitions related to Mondrian's art, including the \\"Mondrian / De Stijl\\" exhibition held in 2010-2011, that focused on the development of the De Stijl movement and the role Mondrian played in its evolution. 4. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York City, United States: In 1998, the museum organized an exhibition titled \\"Mondrian, 1892-1914: The Path to Abstraction\\" that showcased the evolution of Mondrian's style from his early representational work to the beginnings of abstraction. 5. Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, United States: In 2001, the museum held an exhibition named \\"Piet Mondrian: 1905-1944,\\" which featured 44 of Mondrian's paintings and aimed to provide an in-depth look at the development of his art throughout his career. These prestigious exhibitions in various cities around the world demonstrate the widespread recognition and appreciation for Mondrian's artistic contributions. The circulation of his work in different museums and galleries showcases the lasting impact and relevance of Mondrian's art in the global context of the 20th-century avant-garde movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the reason for WhatsApp sending a text in Android but not on iOS when the Internet is absent? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other. Both questions address the issue of the inability to send messages on WhatsApp on iOS devices when there is no internet connection. To provide a detailed answer to this technical issue, let us analyze each platform separately and dig deeper into WhatsApp's functionality on iOS and Android devices. WhatsApp on iOS: WhatsApp on iOS relies heavily on Apple's strict guidelines for app development and user experience standards. One of these guidelines, in particular, is related to the user interface (UI) and how it should reflect the real-time experience of the user. In the case of iOS's WhatsApp, when there is no internet connection, the send button is disabled (grayed out or unresponsive) to indicate that the action cannot be performed. This design choice is aimed at providing a visual feedback to the user that there is no network connection and messages cannot be sent, preventing the user from repeatedly pressing the send button and expecting a different result. This design decision follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines which emphasize the importance of clear and intuitive interfaces. WhatsApp on Android: On Android devices, WhatsApp's behavior when there is no internet connection differs from its iOS counterpart. When users lose internet connection, they can still see the send button as active, allowing them to type and send messages. However, the messages remain in a queue, denoted with a clock symbol, indicating that it has not been sent yet and is waiting for a network connection. This clock symbol serves the same purpose as the disabled send button in iOS: to provide visual feedback that the message cannot be sent due to network unavailability. Once connection is reestablished, the messages in the queue are sent out automatically. This design choice still adheres to Google's Material Design Guidelines, ensuring that users can understand the app's behavior even without an active internet connection. In conclusion, while both Android and iOS versions of WhatsApp function differently when it comes to handling message sending without an internet connection, the underlying reason is that they each follow their respective platform's guidelines for user interface and user experience. These guidelines contribute to maintaining consistent behavior across different applications on each platform, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. Hence, the send button is disabled or unresponsive on iOS devices, whereas Android devices allow messages to be queued and sent once an internet connection is reestablished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Without arthropods pollinating these plants, the overall production and abundance of these food sources would be significantly reduced. While vegetation, reproduction, and hibernation are essential aspects of arthropods' life cycles, it is the pollination process facilitated by arthropods that most directly contributes to the human food supply."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed - The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is holding their breath happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"A person holding their breath can have an effect on the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, though in most cases, it does not lead to a greater amount being delivered. When someone holds their breath, the air in their lungs becomes stagnant, with little to no fresh air being brought in to replace it. As a result, the concentration of oxygen in the lungs decreases while the amount of carbon dioxide increases. This leads to a lower partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs and a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide. This imbalance between oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations will eventually cause the concentration gradient of these gases to change. The concentration gradient is what drives the exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the surrounding capillaries. As the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli lowers, so does the driving force for oxygen to move into the blood. Similarly, as the concentration of carbon dioxide in the alveoli increases, there is less of a driving force for it to be removed from the bloodstream. Consequently, by holding one's breath, the perturbation hampers the efficiency of the gas exchange process in the lungs, leading to a lesser amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, rather than a greater amount. This effect is indirect, as the perturbation itself (holding the breath) does not directly change the concentration of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the alveoli but rather affects the natural process of breathing, which in turn impacts the gas exchange."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to \\"The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\\" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise \\"justice for all,\\" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie. In its new report, the Commission on Access to Justice notes some significant steps toward providing equal access to justice for all Californians.

His most notable achievements are the world 's first liver , heart , and lung transplant in 1987 ; the first successful combined stomach , intestine , pancreas , liver , and kidneycluster transplant in 1994 , the first liver transplantation operation in Europe in 1968 , and the first intestinal transplant in the U.K. in 1992 . Calne is a fellow of the Royal Society and was Professor of Surgery at Cambridge University between 1965 and 1998 where he initiated the kidney transplant program . He was Harkness Fellow at Harvard Medical School from 1960 - 61 . Much of his subsequent work has been concerned with the improvement of immunosuppression techniques aimed at prolonging the life of liver transplant recipients . He is currently the Yoah Ghim Professor of Surgery at the National University of Singapore . He was elected to the Royal Society in 1974 . He was awarded the 1984 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science . The corresponding Lister Oration , given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England , was delivered on 21 May 1985 , and was titled ' Organ transplantation : from laboratory to clinic ' . He was knighted as Knight Bachelor , in 1986 . In 1990 he received the Ellison - Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine . His portrait , commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery , was painted by John Bellany in 1991 . In 2012 , Calne shared the prestigious Lasker Award ( Lasker - DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award ) with Dr. Thomas Starzl ' for the development of liver transplantation , which has restored normal life to thousands of patients with end - stage liver disease . ' . Calne is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and he is an Honorary Vice-President of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club . - The endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Bhutan emphasizes the happiness of its citizens through focusing on their spiritual and social well-being, rather than material over-consumption. By comparing the two countries, we can see that Bhutan has chosen a different path than Qatar, prioritizing its citizens' spiritual and social well-being over material wealth and consumption. This suggests that Bhutan is likely more conscious of the negative impacts of overconsumption and thus may make more of an effort to preserve its environment.

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things.

For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins.

Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To provide a detailed and long answer regarding the prevention of cranberry fruitworm, I will first evaluate each solution's naive physics reasoning based on their practicality, simplicity, and effectiveness. With this analysis, I will determine which solution is more sound according to naive physics reasoning. 1. Cultural practices: By maintaining good cultural practices, such as proper sanitation and debris removal, growers can help reduce the chances of harboring cranberry fruitworm. This involves removing leftover fruit, leaf litter, and other organic material on the field that could potentially provide a habitat for overwintering larvae. Additionally, proper pruning techniques for better airflow, timing of fertilizer applications, and planting early-season-blooming varieties can further minimize infestations. Naive physics reasoning: Cultural practices are a straightforward and practical approach to managing cranberry fruitworm, as they require relatively simple methods that can be easily adopted by farmers. By maintaining clean fields and optimal growing conditions, growers are indirectly preventing the fruitworm from thriving. The reasoning is relatively easy to understand, and the simplicity of these practices makes it a viable option for prevention. 2. Pheromone traps and mating disruption: Pheromone traps can be placed in and around cranberry bogs to monitor adult fruitworm population levels. These traps use chemically synthesized pheromones to attract adult male fruitworms, making it easier to detect their presence. In combination, employing mating disruption techniques (e.g., releasing pheromone dispensers) can confuse male fruitworms, disrupting their ability to locate female counterparts, and thus reducing mating success and population growth. Naive physics reasoning: Pheromone traps and mating disruption techniques involve a more complex understanding of the biology and behavior of the cranberry fruitworm. However, the reasoning for their use is still practical and effective when explained. The concept of detecting and controlling the adult population to prevent larvae infestation is relatively easy to grasp, making this solution a sound choice based on naive physics reasoning. 3. Biological control: Introducing beneficial organisms, such as parasitic wasps and predatory beetles, can help manage the cranberry fruitworm population through natural predation. Regularly releasing these beneficial insects in the affected area may provide a sustainable long-term solution. Naive physics reasoning: The idea of biological control would likely be considered sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it involves using the natural predators of the cranberry fruitworm to control its population. The concept of \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\" is both practical and common-sensical. Implementing biological control is also relatively simple and cost-effective, which adds to its suitability as a prevention measure. 4. Chemical control: Applying insecticides can help minimize cranberry fruitworm populations, but this should be done judiciously targeting the most vulnerable stages of the insect's life cycle. Using selective biological insecticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, could disrupt larvae feeding and growth without harming many beneficial organisms. However, mismanagement of chemical control can result in insecticide resistance and other harmful side effects to the environment. Naive physics reasoning: Chemical control, when used responsibly and selectively, can be a sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning, as its effectiveness in eliminating the fruitworm population is often easy to understand. However, potential negative consequences like insecticide-resistant pests, the harm to beneficial insects, and environmental issues may cause concerns and should be taken into consideration while evaluating its overall effectiveness. In conclusion, through the lens of naive physics reasoning, among the four solutions discussed above, cultural practices and biological control seem to be the most sound options, as they are relatively simple, practical, and effective. Pheromone traps and mating disruption come in close second due to their comprehensible concept, while chemical control remains a viable option as long as its potential side effects are considered and managed properly."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? from the following article ? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","completion":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is George Frideric Handel.

Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan (Noble Willingham). Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different, and Josie convinces Jim to run away with her. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having such a large store to themselves. Josie, having 52,000 in her purse, convinces Jim to run away with her to California as soon as they get out of Target in the morning. Meanwhile, Roger teams up with the town sheriff to search for his runaway daughter all night. Things become complicated when two incompetent crooks, Nestor Pyle and Gil Kinney (brothers Dermot and Kieran Mulroney, respectively), break into Target and hold the two hostage. Eventually, Josie seduces one of the crooks and convinces him to take her with them after robbing the store. While the criminals are loading stolen merchandise into the trunk, Josie jumps into the front seat and drives away quickly, leaving the two men stranded in the parking lot. Meanwhile, in the building, Jim loads up a shotgun found in the head custodian's locker and tricks Nestor and Gil by luring them to the back of the store and holding them at gunpoint.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To saute mushrooms in Sherry, you can follow these simple steps: 1. First, clean the mushrooms by gently wiping them with a damp cloth or paper towel. Don't rinse them under water, as they can get soggy. 2. Next, slice the mushrooms if they are large, or leave them whole if they are small. 3. Now, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little bit of olive oil or butter to the pan. Just enough to help the mushrooms cook and not stick to the pan. 4. Once the pan is heated, add your mushrooms. Cook them for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften and turn a nice golden-brown color. 5. At this point, you can add the Sherry. Sherry is a type of wine that adds a sweet and nutty flavor to your mushrooms. Pour a small amount of Sherry into the pan, about 1/4 cup should be enough. If you're unsure, ask a grown-up for help measuring the Sherry. 6. Let the mushrooms cook with the Sherry for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid to reduce a bit and the mushrooms to absorb the delicious flavors. 7. Finally, you can remove the pan from heat and add a little bit of salt and pepper to taste, if you'd like. Just a little sprinkle should do the trick. And there you have it! Delicious sauteed mushrooms in Sherry. Try serving them with some rice or your favorite dish. Enjoy! In conclusion, the more reasonable method for sauteing mushrooms in Sherry is to clean and slice the mushrooms, heat the pan with some oil or butter, cook the mushrooms, add the Sherry and cook for a few more minutes, and season to taste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Alan Pardew tried to sign Ajax midfielder last season. 25-year-old scored seven times in Dutch league last season. Can play as a playmaker or second striker to boost Pardew's attack.","completion":"Title: Alan Pardew's Pursuit of the Dynamic Ajax Midfielder: A Boost for His Attacking Arsenal Last season saw a flurry of activity in the football transfer market, as clubs were eager to strengthen their squads and secure some promising talents. Former West Bromwich Albion manager, Alan Pardew, was no exception, as he tried to lure a dynamic 25-year-old midfielder from Dutch giants, Ajax, to bolster his attacking options. An exciting prospect for Pardew's side, this young talent is notable for scoring seven goals in the Dutch league last season, displaying an innate ability to function as a playmaker or second striker for the team. With his eyes set on the versatile Ajax midfielder, this integral addition could have undoubtedly augmented Pardew's attacking force, providing the necessary depth and flexibility to his squad. Given the player's impressive track record in the Dutch league, it comes as no surprise that Pardew was keen on acquiring the 25-year-old. The young powerhouse's success last season can be attributed to his adaptability on the field, with the capacity to play as both a playmaker and a second striker. This versatility would have offered Pardew multiple tactical approaches in competitions, providing a plethora of options when formulating attack strategies. As a playmaker, the Ajax star would have been responsible for creating goal-scoring opportunities for teammates, utilizing his advanced vision and intelligent gameplay to dismantle defenses and exploit weaknesses. Additionally, his goalscoring prowess would have ideally complemented his playmaking abilities, reflecting the perfect blend of creativity and scoring ability to push Pardew's team forward. Moreover, Pardew's pursuit of this Ajax midfielder highlights his intention to build a well-rounded squad, capable of evolving and adapting to any in-game situation. The inclusion of a dual-role player, such as the 25-year-old, would have afforded Pardew a greater degree of flexibility - granting him the ability to make adjustments based on the opposition's lineup, match scenarios, and other tactical considerations. With the player predominantly operating in the final third of the pitch, his instinctive movement and understanding of the game would have potentially opened up new avenues for Pardew's team to exploit. However, despite the undeniable benefits that this talent would have brought to Pardew's side, the deal ultimately did not materialize. Regardless, the pursuit of the Ajax midfielder highlights Pardew's ambitions and tactical awareness, showcasing his ability to identify and pursue potential targets that would seamlessly integrate into his strategic vision. In conclusion, the interest displayed by Alan Pardew in the Ajax midfielder exemplifies his commitment to developing a dynamic, attack-minded squad. His attempt to sign the 25-year-old, who demonstrated remarkable potential during his time in the Dutch league, signifies his ongoing search for standout performers to further enhance his team's capabilities. Although this specific transfer did not come to fruition, it is evident that Pardew's hunger to strengthen and diversify his roster remains undiminished. With eyes now set on the future, we can certainly anticipate more astute and ambitious moves from the experienced manager, as he continues to scour the footballing world for talented individuals who will fortify his attacking arsenal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Zombies starts with the breaking news that the unidentified disease that is spreading across America leaves the sufferer with homicidal & cannibalistic tendencies... Travis Fontaine (C.S. Munro) & his teenage daughter Jenna (Bonny Giroux) listen to the radio as they drive along the isolated backwoods roads to try & escape the disease when Travis runs over a guy who I assume is meant to be a zombie. Slightly further down the road he stops to help Julia (Brinke Stevens) & her teenage daughter Carmilla (Maratama Carlson) who are waving at the side of the road, at this point there is also a third teenage girl named Tessa (Melanie Crystal) sitting in the back of Julia's car bound & gagged. To me this situation would seem strange but Travis, like the trooper he is, takes it all in his stride & agrees to 'take' Carmilla off Julia's hands &, well I don't know actually. So, with a complete stranger, Travis drives off leaving Julia & Tessa. Carmilla seems like a nice girl but she turns out to be a Vampire & she likes to bite people & turn them into Vampires, oh & she's partial to a bit of lesbianism too. Travis, Carmilla & Jenna continue to travel while some guy who calls himself The General (Peter Ruginis) who appears to be some sort of Vampire killer & probably has something to do with it all but the film is such a mess it doesn't really matter & I really don't know how to carry on this plot outline as my head hurts just thinking about it... Co-edited, co-executive produced, written & directed by the supremely untalented Vince D'Amato Vampires Vs. Zombies is one of the worst horror films ever & therefore one of the worst films ever period. The script by D'Amato was apparently based on a classic story entitled 'Carmilla' by Sheridan Le Fanu (he should sue) & is an absolute mess, the holes in the plot & logic are so big you could drive a tank through them! What is the disease that turns people into zombies? Why is Carmilla a Vampire? Who is Julia to her? Who the hell is The General? What does he want? Where are Travis & Jenna going? How can Travis run a man over & yet not have the slightest bit of human emotion over it? What's with the mental ward at the end? There are also some confusing & unnecessary dream sequences just to annoy the viewer even more. There are just so many things wrong with this film, the narrative doesn't make a blind bit of sense, the concept is terrible & never really explained properly plus it's incredibly boring. I have not one positive thing to say about Vampire Vs. Zombies, not one. Forget about any Vampires fighting Zombies because it just doesn't happen, tell me again why is this film called Vampires Vs. Zombies? Director D'Amato has served up one of the most incompetent, rubbishy, badly made, poorly thought out & excruciatingly painful viewing experiences ever made. Vampires Vs. Zombies really has no redeeming qualities at all, there is not one single aspect that I can praise. The gore is really fake looking, there are some blood splats which look like red water, some really cheap staking effects & a half decent climax where the zombies feast on Carmilla's & Jenna's intestines, this fairly gory scene is probably the best part of the whole wretched film but it only lasts for a couple of minutes & in no way makes up for the other turgid 85. The budget on Vampires Vs. Zombies must have been small, in fact did it even have a budget because most of it is set on a road in a couple of cars. This is one of the most badly made horror films it's been my misfortune to watch, the entire thing just sucks. The acting is predictably awful, & I mean awful.

Love sushi so I decided to try this place out. Sad to say it was definitely disappointing and a waste of money. Yuck.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review appears to be largely negative. One can analyze the sentiment by examining the language the reviewer uses to express their opinion. The reviewer starts by giving some context as to why they went to the restaurant, stating that they \\"love sushi.\\" This provides background information but does not carry a strong sentiment in itself. However, the rest of the review carries a strong negative sentiment. The reviewer then continues by saying they are \\"sad to say\\" that the restaurant was a disappointment. The phrase \\"sad to say\\" gives the impression that the reviewer is expressing genuine regret about their experience. Furthermore, the term \\"disappointing\\" directly conveys that the sushi restaurant didn't meet their expectations. This produces a negative sentiment, as it reflects dissatisfaction with their experience. In the next sentence, the reviewer describes the experience as a \\"waste of money.\\" This indicates that in the reviewer's opinion, the dining experience was not worth the price they paid. People generally view a waste of money as a strong negative point when evaluating any product or service, especially when it comes to dining out. This further contributes to the negative sentiment within the review. Lastly, the reviewer concludes their thoughts by using the word \\"yuck.\\" This word is a common exclamation used when expressing displeasure or disgust regarding taste. Its inclusion in the review strongly suggests a negative sentiment, as it shows the reviewer didn't enjoy the taste of the sushi, which is a crucial factor in any dining experience. In summary, the overall sentiment of the given review is negative. While the reviewer does provide context for their visit by expressing their love for sushi, their opinion of the restaurant itself is one of disappointment, regret, and dissatisfaction. Key phrases like \\"disappointing,\\" \\"waste of money,\\" and \\"yuck\\" emphasize the negative sentiment and paint a stark picture of their dining experience at the sushi restaurant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Victoria Woollaston PUBLISHED: 06:33 EST, 22 May 2013 | UPDATED: 01:59 EST, 23 May 2013 The Brazilian government has spent £4.2 million (7.2 million) on robots to prepare the country ahead of the Pope's visit next year and the Rio Olympics in 2016. The iRobot 510 PackBots, built by Massachusetts-based robotics firm iRobot Defense and Security, have previously served in the war in Iraq and are described as 'multi-mission, battle-tested' robots. They are set to be used during the construction of Olympic stadiums to help clear routes and hunt for explosives. Scroll down for video If communication to the","completion":"robots is disrupted or lost, the PackBots are designed to immediately switch to autonomous mode, relying on built-in sensors and algorithms to continue their tasks with as minimal disruption as possible until communication can be re-established. This technology is crucial in ensuring the safety of construction workers, athletes, visitors, and officials during the high-profile events. The Brazilian government's investment in these advanced, cutting-edge robots showcases their commitment to provide a safe and secure environment for the Pope's visit and the Rio Olympics. The decision to utilize battle-tested robots is a strategic move, leveraging their proven reliability and success in past military operations and adapting their usage to fit the need for increased security at these significant global events. The iRobot 510 PackBots will be deployed in teams, working together to provide comprehensive coverage of the construction areas and event venues. With highly sensitive cameras and detection systems, the robots will be able to swiftly identify potential explosives or hazards and relay that information back to their human counterparts, allowing for a swift and efficient response in case of an emergency. In addition to their role in ensuring safety during construction and the events, the PackBots will also serve as a valuable training tool for Brazil's security forces. By working alongside the robots, Brazilian officers will gain valuable experience in working with advanced robotics technology, further enhancing the nation's overall security capabilities. Public reaction to the government's investment in the iRobot 510 PackBots has been largely positive, with many recognizing the need for increased security measures during such high-profile events. However, there have been concerns from some who view the use of these expensive military-grade robots as an unnecessary expenditure, considering the country's ongoing social and economic challenges. As the Pope's visit and the Rio Olympics draw nearer, the iRobot 510 PackBots will be subjected to a series of rigorous tests to ensure their effectiveness and reliability in this new environment. Through successful collaboration between the Brazilian government and iRobot Defense and Security, it is hoped that these versatile, state-of-the-art robots will become a vital component in creating a safe and secure atmosphere for all attendees of these events, while also showcasing Brazil's commitment to technological advancement and innovation on the global stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Britain should have no fear of quitting the European Union, which could ‘open up opportunities’ for the country, a senior Tory minister says today. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017. ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip. Highlights:","completion":"1.

When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym.

To begin with, let us break down the initial sentence: 1. \\"A small white dog is running through the dirt right on the outside of a patch of grass.\\" This part of the sentence explicitly mentions a small white dog engaging in an activity outside, which indicates that there is at least one animal outdoors. 2. \\"A patch of grass where two people and another small black dog are playing.\\" This portion of the sentence introduces two more subjects - the two people and an additional small black dog. While it explicitly states that the two people are outdoors (by mentioning that they're on a patch of grass), it is also reasonable to conclude that the small black dog is outdoors too, as it is involved in the activity of playing together with the two people on the patch of grass. From these two segments of the sentence, we can identify at least two animals: the small white dog and the small black dog. Both of these animals are described as engaging in activities outside (running through the dirt and playing on a patch of grass, respectively). As a result, the assertion that \\"Some animals are outdoors.\\" can be validated as a true statement.

What is the answer?","completion":"Windsor, Neuschwanstein, and Blarney are three famous historical castles located in different countries across Europe. Each of these castles has its own history, architectural significance, and cultural impact. Let's explore each one in detail. 1. Windsor Castle: Windsor Castle is a royal residence in Windsor, England. It is the largest and oldest inhabited castle in the world and has been a home to the British monarchy for over 900 years. The castle’s history dates back to the 11th century when it was built by William the Conqueror as a defensive fortification. Since then, it has undergone numerous renovations and expansions under various monarchs. Windsor Castle serves both as a residence for the reigning monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and as a popular tourist attraction. The castle covers an area of 13 acres, encompassing numerous buildings and fortifications. Among its notable features are the Round Tower, St. George's Chapel, the State Apartments, and Queen Mary's Dollhouse. The castle serves as a significant symbol of the British monarchy, showcases impressive architecture, and houses a vast collection of precious artworks and historic artifacts. 2. Neuschwanstein Castle: Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century palace located in the Bavarian Alps, near the town of Füssen, Germany. It was commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and an homage to the composer Richard Wagner. The castle is a striking example of German Romantic architecture, which seeks to evoke a sense of fairytale enchantment. Designed by the architect Eduard Riedel and realized with the artistic input of stage designer Christian Jank, the castle’s construction began in 1869 and remained incomplete due to the king’s untimely death in 1886. Neuschwanstein features numerous towers, spires, and balconies, as well as elaborate interior decorations, including murals depicting scenes from Wagner's operas. Today, Neuschwanstein Castle is an iconic tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors worldwide. It has, in fact, inspired the design of the Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle. 3. Blarney Castle: Blarney Castle is a medieval fortress situated in the village of Blarney, near Cork, Ireland. The current structure dates back to the 15th century, built by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, the then Lord of Muscry. However, the history of the site can be traced back to earlier fortifications, with the first castle on the site built in the 10th century. Blarney Castle is world-renowned for housing the Blarney Stone, a limestone block that is believed to possess mystical qualities. According to legend, anyone who kisses the stone will be granted the \\"gift of gab\\"–the ability to speak eloquently and convincingly. Visitors take part in the ritual of kissing the stone by leaning backward over a gap on the castle's parapet. Apart from the Blarney Stone, the castle features intriguing architectural elements, such as the Badger Cave, the Poison Garden, and the battlements that provide breathtaking views of the castle grounds. In conclusion, Windsor, Neuschwanstein, and Blarney are three historically significant and architecturally fascinating castles located across Europe. Each castle embodies the distinct cultural characteristics, legends, and historical tales that continue to captivate the imaginations of visitors from around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the primary symptoms that is so common with a malarial infection is a high fever, at least 102°F (38.9°C). It's also one of the first symptoms to appear as early as seven days (although usually between 10 – 15 days) after getting bitten by an infected mosquito. Often the fever comes and goes randomly. This is thought to be related to the malaria parasites transiently spreading into blood from the liver. There are at least five types of Plasmodium parasites that infect people, although P. falciparum (mainly in Africa) and P. vivax (mainly in Latin America and Asia) are the most common and deadly. The fever and other initial symptoms may be mild and mimic less serious viral infections, such as the common cold and influenza. Usually symptoms don't appear for about two weeks after being bitten. The other primary symptom of malaria is severe shaking chills with intermittent periods of sweating. Again, shaking chills are typical of many other types of infections, but they are usually more pronounced and severe with malaria. They can cause teeth to chatter and even prevent sleep. When they're severe, the shaking can be mistaken for seizures. The chills from malaria are usually not remedied by blanket cover or by wearing warmer clothes. Although the primary symptoms of malaria typically begin within a few weeks of being bitten by an infected mosquito, some types of malarial parasites can lie dormant in the body for up to a year or more. Malarial symptoms are caused by the bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject the parasite into the host's bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver where they lay dormant for a week or two before causing symptoms. Secondary and less specific symptoms of malaria are moderate-to-severe headaches, often combined with mild muscle aches. These secondary symptoms often occur a short while after the above-mentioned primary symptoms as the parasite needs a little more time to proliferate in the liver and spread around the body in the bloodstream. Headaches and muscle aches are also very common with most other infections, as well as from the bites of other insects and spiders. The bites from female Anopheles mosquitoes are not very noticeable (a small, red, itchy bump), unlike the bites of some other insects and spiders that can cause similar symptoms. The initial headaches of malaria are typically dull in nature (like a tension headache), but as the parasites start to infect and destroy red blood cells, they can become pounding in nature (more like a migraine). The achy pain is usually most noticeable in the leg and back muscles because they are larger, more active and get more of the infected blood. Other non-specific secondary symptoms of malaria are vomiting and diarrhea, multiple times per day. They often occur in combination with each other, which mimics the initial symptoms of food poisoning and other bacterial infections. The main difference is that the vomiting/diarrhea caused by food poisoning fades away within a few days, whereas it can remain for a few weeks with malaria (depending on treatment). Unlike the explosive and bloody diarrhea of some bacterial infections, particularly Shigella, there's usually no blood or severe cramping with malaria. Once the primary and secondary symptoms become noticeable, the malaria-causing parasites can be seen under a microscope from a drop of infected blood — especially if the specimen is stained with Giemsa stain. If the advancing primary and secondary symptoms don't prompt the infected person to seek medical attention and get treatment (which may not be possible in the developing world), then symptoms begin to appear that signify serious injury / damage to the body. When these advanced symptoms of malaria appear, the risk of health complications and death significantly increase. Confusion, multiple convulsions, coma and neurological impairment indicate brain swelling and injury. Severe anemia, abnormal bleeding, deep labored breathing and respiratory distress indicate advanced blood infection and lung involvement. Jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes) is evidence of liver damage and dysfunction.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman? , can you please find it? During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio.

Sentence 1: The indigents served by the center won't be the only ones to benefit. Sentence 2: They will only help indigents. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true given that the first sentence is true, let us analyze both sentences step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of each sentence. Sentence 1 states that \\"The indigents served by the center won't be the only ones to benefit.\\" This means that the center serves indigents, but they are not the only ones who will benefit from its services. Sentence 2 states, \\"They will only help indigents.\\" This means that the center only serves indigents and no other group. Step 2: Compare both sentences. Comparing both sentences, we see that Sentence 1 implies that there are other groups aside from indigents that may benefit from the center—a more inclusive perspective. On the other hand, Sentence 2 asserts that the center exclusively helps indigents—a more restrictive perspective. Step 3: Assess if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true. Since Sentence 1 mentions that indigents are not the only ones who will benefit, this implies the existence of other groups that the center helps. Therefore, the second sentence, which states that the center only helps indigents, contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1.

Alexander II's death caused a great setback for the reform movement. One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory. Question: \\"Who was the founder of the idea for an elected parliament in Russia?\\" Answer: \\"Nicholas II\\" Is this answer to the question correct? pick from the following. 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"1. no. The correct answer should be Alexander II, as he was the one who drafted plans for an elected parliament or Duma. Though a Duma was eventually commissioned by Nicholas II in 1905, the idea and initial plans were from Alexander II before his death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reviewer has expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the product, stating that it has never worked in their experience.

Pacquiao played down the possibility as he talked to reporters on his return. \\"We are not forcing a fight with him. It is right that he is the one challenging me, because my fights score more on pay-per-view,\\" he said. Pacquiao has greatly enhanced his reputation with successive wins over Oscar de la Hoya, Britain's Ricky Hatton and Cotto. Mayweather returned to the ring with a comfortable win over Juan Manuel Marquez and has the reputation for grossing massive receipts from his pay-per-view appearances.

Math Problem Solve 40*m + 35*m - 9 = 76*m for m.","completion":"To solve the equation 40*m + 35*m - 9 = 76*m for m, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with m: 40*m and 35*m. Add these two terms: 40*m + 35*m = 75*m. Now, the equation is: 75*m - 9 = 76*m. Step 2: Move all terms with m to one side and constants to the other side. We want to get all terms with m on one side of the equation and all constants on the other side. To do this, we'll first subtract 75*m from both sides of the equation to move it to the right side: 75*m - 9 - 75*m = 76*m - 75*m. This simplifies to: -9 = m. Step 3: Check the answer. Substitute m with the value we found, which is -9, to check if the given equation holds true. 40*(-9) + 35*(-9) - 9 = 76*(-9) -360 - 315 - 9 = -684 -684 = -684 The equation holds true, which confirms that the value of m is indeed -9.

Q:Given the following context: The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus. answer the following question: What games lasted for more than one hundred days?

To my disappointment, this turned into more of a comedy than a horror. The acting, dialog, and flow of the movie was all very poorly done. Much of it didn't make sense. For example, there's a party of about 30 people and they're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard. I kept thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try. The blood and gore are also poorly done. I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this. A guy with his head cut clean off... looked clean - missing signs bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax. Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist, but contradicted other parts in the story. What was going in the guy's mind to turn out like that?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off? ? Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head. A:","completion":"Tom accidentally puts the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off.

Throughout their history, the Liberals have been in electoral terms largely the party of the middle class (whom Menzies, in the era of the party's formation called \\"The forgotten people\\"), though such class-based voting patterns are no longer as clear as they once were. In the 1970s a left-wing middle class emerged that no longer voted Liberal.[citation needed] One effect of this was the success of a breakaway party, the Australian Democrats, founded in 1977 by former Liberal minister Don Chipp and members of minor liberal parties; other members of the left-leaning section of the middle-class became Labor supporters.[citation needed] On the other hand, the Liberals have done increasingly well in recent years among socially conservative working-class voters.[citation needed]However the Liberal Party's key support base remains the upper-middle classes; 16 of the 20 richest federal electorates are held by the Liberals, most of which are safe seats.

Premise: \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century.\\"?","completion":"First of all, to analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their components: Premise: \\"The French Revolution in 1789 sent ripples of discontent through the Caribbean.\\" - Component 1: The French Revolution occurred in 1789. - Component 2: The French Revolution caused discontent in the Caribbean. Hypothesis: \\"Discontent was unheard of in the Caribbean in the 18th century.\\" - This statement suggests that there was no discontent present in the Caribbean throughout the entire 18th century. Next, let's compare the hypothesis against the components of the premise: 1. Considering Component 1 (The French Revolution occurred in 1789): - The French Revolution is a historical event that was part of the 18th century. - Therefore, the French Revolution has a potential effect in the context of the 18th century in this case. 2. Considering Component 2 (The French Revolution caused discontent in the Caribbean): - This shows that the French Revolution led to discontent in the Caribbean during the 18th century, specifically in 1789. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: - The hypothesis suggests that discontent was not present in the Caribbean during the 18th century. - The premise, however, shows that the French Revolution in 1789 caused discontent in the Caribbean. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other. The premise indicates that discontent indeed occurred in the Caribbean during the 18th century, at least due to the French Revolution, while the hypothesis asserts that discontent was unheard of during the same period. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Instead, it refutes it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II.

When Ronny ends up a victim of the mysterious killer, Skip attempts to find Ronny with the help of Gail, who works as a bartender during Spring Break. The duo soon find Ronny and learn that local police chief Strycher (John Saxon) and physician Doc Willet (Michael Parks) have covered up Ronny's death in order for the partygoers not to worry. However, as the body count rises, Gail and Skip begin to wonder if Diablo made good on his promise to return from the dead or is someone else responsible. A confrontation at a local tire yard between Gail and the biker reveals that the killer is Reverend Bates (Lance Le Gault), who thinks Spring Break is nothing more than an excuse for sins.

Ge Garden is very beautiful and peaceful. The ticket has a map on the back of it that I didn't noticed until I had already left. But to be honest, I don't think that map is very useful because it isn't very clear an tailed. In my opinion, it's better to improve it. Compared with He Garden, the map on the back of the ticket for He Garden is much clearer, more detailed and more useful. However, in the room that has the picture of the family members, there is only Chinese, no English, so my advice is to add English in interesting places. I got lost in the Slender West Lake. I spent about 30 minutes just trying to get out of one area. I think they need more signs posted along the trails. I like the Slender West Lake best, as she is so pretty! The ladies that were sweeping were very sweet. They always smiled at me and said hello, so it was nice. Taking a taxi is the most efficient and quickest way to get around Yangzhou. I didn't have a problem getting to the places which I'd like to go to while using a taxi. The driver was very friendly. The fare isn't too high, either. But I didn't enjoy taking the bus. The bus ride to the Mastixia Bay took long although I only had to pay one yuan. It was also hard finding where Bus 32 was. I tried asking some people in English but they couldn't understand me, so I had to ask in simple Chinese that I only know buy that still didn't work. I spent about one hour walking around the city to look for Bus 32. The tricycle was nice, but it was a little too expensive for a small distance. Maybe I was _ by the guy who rode for me, but it was an enjoyable ride. I felt like I was part of the garden city more. Over all I am satisfied with Yangzhou and will recommend it to others.

Elena hated the smell of that soap compared to Laura, because [+] Elena had bad memories from that smell.; [+] Laura had bad memories from that smell.;","completion":"Elena hated the smell of that soap compared to Laura, because the scent triggered terrible memories in both their minds. For Elena, the smell brought back unsettling flashbacks of a time when she was trapped in a small, dimly lit room during a traumatic event, the pungent aroma of that soap lingering in the air. Laura, on the other hand, had her own haunting recollections associated with the soap, as it reminded her of a deeply upsetting aftermath from a past relationship that had emotionally drained her. The mere whiff of the soap was enough to throw them both into a spiral of unwanted memories, its aroma penetrating their minds and dragging them back to those dark moments that they desperately wished to forget. Despite the passage of time, both Elena and Laura could not shake the emotional impact the soap's scent had on them, and they dreaded the inevitable rush of painful feelings that would surface whenever they encountered it. It was a testament to the power of scent association and how certain fragrances could evoke such a strong emotional response, leaving them both struggling to overcome the shadow cast by their past experiences. But as this soap continued to haunt them, Elena and Laura also drew strength from each other's shared suffering, united by their shared torment and determined to overcome the grip that this seemingly innocuous object held on their lives. Together, they began a journey toward healing, gradually moving forward but always mindful of the profound impact a mere smell could have on their hearts and minds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward - The mold sends out spores. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: Spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony. In order to provide a detailed and long answer, here's the complete explanation of the mold growth process, including the missing step: 1. Spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony: Mold reproduces by releasing tiny, lightweight spores into the air. These spores are the mold's way of reproducing and can travel through the air, water, or even hitch a ride on animals and insects. The parent mold colony produces millions of these spores in the hopes that they will find a suitable environment to start a new colony. 2. The spore lands on a piece of bread: Once the spores are released into the environment, their goal is to find a suitable surface to land on. In this case, the spore lands on a piece of bread, which provides it with a food source and a place to grow. Bread is an ideal environment for mold growth because it contains moisture, nutrients, and a porous surface that allows the mold to easily penetrate the structure of the bread. 3. The spore grows hyphae into the bread: After landing on the bread, the spore begins germinating by growing thin, root-like structures called hyphae. These hyphae are responsible for absorbing nutrients, allowing the mold to grow and reproduce. The hyphae penetrate the bread, consuming the nutrients and moisture they find within the porous structure, acting as the primary absorption and anchor mechanism of the mold. 4. The mold forms a colony: As the mold absorbs nutrients and moisture from the bread, it forms a visible colony on the surface. This colony consists of millions of individual mold cells, which can appear in different colors depending on the species of mold. Mold can grow quickly and, in some cases, can become visible within 24-48 hours of initial spore germination. 5. Sporangiophores grow upward: The next step in the mold growth process is the formation of sporangiophores. These are specialized, aerial hyphae that extend above the main body of the mold colony. Their role is to support and protect the reproductive spores, helping them develop and ultimately be released into the environment. 6. The mold sends out spores: At the end of the sporangiophores are structures called sporangia that contain the newly produced spores. When conditions are right, the sporangia open or rupture, releasing the spores into the environment. These spores then disperse and look for a suitable environment to land on, germinate, and start the entire mold growth process again. In summary, the missing first step of the process is the spore production and dispersal by the parent mold colony. This step is essential for ensuring the continuity of mold growth and reproduction, as well as for maintaining genetic diversity within mold populations."},{"prompt":"Here's a question: What has happened to a person's money after he or she has used the last of it?

Cells grow and make new cells. Most cells are very small and we can't see them with our eyes. Different cells have different uses. Our skin cells are special ones. The cells on the outside of our skin are old dead cells. New skin cells are right under the outside. These are the living skin cells. They work for our bodies. They help protect our bodies and heal cuts. Our bodies make skin cells all the time. As the old cells fall off, new cells grow in the same place. Each person makes about 18 kg of skin cells during his or her life. Outside skin cells fit together closely with no _ between them. When you cut yourself, you can harm your skin cells. A small cut will not be harmful. Your skin will quickly heal itself by making new skin cells. How do skin cells work? First, the cells near the cut get bigger and move into the gap. Next, these bigger cells meet in the middle. They form a new layer of skin cells. Finally, new cells will grow until the gap disappears. In this way, your skin can grow and get well itself.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent","completion":"The sentiment expressed in the sentence is primarily negative. This sentiment is conveyed through the critical tone and the specific critiques given. The statement is evaluating the performances of the cast members in a work (likely a play or a film) that involves characters with vampire accents, similar to Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula. The negative sentiment is derived from three main points mentioned in the sentence: 1. \\"Uneven performances\\": This suggests that the cast members' performances might be inconsistent or varied in their quality. In other words, some performances might be better than others, either within an individual cast member's performance or across different cast members. This implies that the overall quality of the production may be affected by these variations. The use of the word \\"uneven\\" is a negative evaluation of the performances. 2. \\"Bound and determined\\": This phrase implies that the cast members are making a deliberate effort to duplicate Bela Lugosi's vampire accent. The use of the words \\"bound\\" and \\"determined\\" suggests a conscious and perhaps unyielding attempt to imitate this particular accent. This conveys a negative sentiment because it implies that the cast members are not bringing originality or their own flair to the characters, but rather mimicking something that has already been done before. 3. \\"Now-clichéd vampire accent\\": Mentioning that the accent has become cliché implies that the imitation of Bela Lugosi's accent is overused and no longer unique or interesting. A cliché is something that has become trite or commonplace, often through repeated exposure or use. Since the writer refers to the accent as \\"now-clichéd,\\" this denotes that it was once considered original but has since lost its novelty. The fact that the cast members are replicating such a clichéd accent instead of attempting something more fresh and distinctive adds to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. In summary, the sentence conveys a negative sentiment through the three main points of criticism: the uneven performances, the cast members' determination to duplicate a specific accent, and the fact that this accent has become cliché. These elements together create a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the performances described."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In July 2014 I made a reservation for a January 2015 Friday-Monday weekend stay at the Downtown Grand Las Vegas. In January 2014 during my annual buddy-trip to Vegas I had seen the hotel and liked it very much, deciding I would stay there for future trips. Unfortunately I just found out that a work meeting is requiring me to be in Europe on Monday of this years' trip, meaning I have to cancel my Vegas trip as I have to fly to Europe on Saturday instead in order to make the meeting. Even more unfortunate, despite 6 WEEKS NOTICE, Choice Hotels/Downtown Grand refuses to refund the 426.76 I paid back in July for this reservation merely because I received a prepaid discount. Apparently their business practices don't account for people being forced to change or cancel plans over a 6 month period. Even worse, I couldn't even change to another weekend or give the room to one of my Vegas trip buddies. No cancellations, no changes, no transfers. However now that the unmoved reservations people I talked to on the phone know I can't make it, the hotel will pocket my money and sell the room to someone else. I suggest the Choice Hotels/The Downtown Grand re-evaluate this business practice.

George Galloway (born 16 August 1954) is a British politician, broadcaster, and writer. Between 1987 and 2015, with a gap in 2010-12, he represented four constituencies as a Member of Parliament, elected as a candidate for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party. After becoming the youngest ever Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he became General Secretary of the London-based charity War on Want in 1983, remaining in the post until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party, having been found guilty by the party's national constitutional committee of four of the five charges of bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on Arabs to fight British troops. In January 1994, Galloway faced some of his strongest criticism on his return from a Middle Eastern visit during which he had met Saddam Hussein. At his meeting with the Iraqi leader, he reported the support given to Saddam by the people of the Gaza Strip which he had just visited: \\"I can honestly tell you that there was not a single person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support.\\" He ended his speech with the statement \\"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\\" Galloway has asserted that he was saluting the Iraqi people rather than Saddam Hussein in the speech, which was translated for the Iraqi leader. As news of the incident reached the UK, Labour leader John Smith, in a statement, said: \\"I deeply deplore the foolish statement made in Iraq by Mr. George Galloway. In no way did he speak for the Labour Party and I wholly reject his comments.\\" Shortly after his return, Galloway was given a \\"severe reprimand\\" by the Labour Chief Whip, Derek Foster, for his unauthorised trip to Iraq. The MP apologised for his conduct and undertook to follow future instruction from the whips. For his visit with Saddam, Galloway was dubbed the \\"MP for Baghdad North\\". Galloway said, when he spoke before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005, that he had \\"met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him.\\" Whereas \\"Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns\\", Galloway had \\"met him to try to bring about an end to sanctions, suffering and war.\\" Ask a question about this article.","completion":"What was the purpose of George Galloway's meeting with Saddam Hussein, according to his statement made before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest.

On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and Perry Como, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the evening—one for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host Chesterfield Supper Club from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and Peggy Lee hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with Chesterfield Supper Club, Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student.

The answer to the question: What did Hans Müller think would prevent tragedy befalling he and his family? is inside the article: After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Hans Müller, the German protagonist in the narrative you provided, believed that his fame and popularity would protect his family, preventing tragedy from befalling them. Müller was a professional juggler before World War II, and it seemed that his celebrity status gave him a false sense of security during the Nazi regime's rise in Germany. In retrospect, he recognized this as a fatal mistake because he ignored warnings from friends encouraging him to flee the country while he could.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How did athletics guide the formation of debate?\\" Context: \\"Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Athletics played a significant role in shaping the formation of debate by providing a model for how debates were structured, promoted, and perceived during the early years of intercollegiate debating competitions. Between 1892 and 1909, when intercollegiate debates gained popularity in universities such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the language, symbols, and metaphors from athletics were borrowed to frame these early debates. Debates were given a high level of importance, being featured on the front pages of college newspapers and noted in yearbooks. The team members participating in the debates received recognition similar to athletes – they were awarded the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. Debates even adopted the tradition of holding rallies before debating teams headed off to matches. However, despite the similarities between athletics and debates, the latter did not achieve the same widespread appeal as sports. There are several reasons for this: 1. Scoring in debates was subjective, unlike in sports where scoring is more objective and clear winners are determined. Debates often ended with no definitive victory for either side due to the nature of the arguments and the differing perspectives of the judges. 2. During the late 19th century, there was a growing concern about the impact of modern life on the human body, and athletics offered a physical and healthy outlet that helped to counteract these negative influences. As such, athletics held a more important role in society and provided an antidote to the challenges posed by modern life. In conclusion, athletics served as an influential guide for the formation of debate by helping to shape its structure, promotion, and perception in the early years of intercollegiate debates. The language, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics provided a framework for debates, while the recognition and traditions associated with sports helped to elevate the status of debating competitions. However, debates did not attain the same level of popularity as athletics due to the subjectivity of scoring and the specific societal needs that athletics addressed in this period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Pb2+ causes lead glass to have what? A: The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 Ohm·cm, DC at 250 °C). Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Pb2+ ions cause lead glass to possess several unique properties, primarily due to their high ionic radius. They include: 1. High refractive index: The incorporation of Pb2+ ions in glass increases its refractive index, which measures the degree to which light is bent as it passes through the material. This results in increased light dispersion and a more brilliant appearance in comparison to soda-lime glass. Lead glass is often used in the making of high-quality optical lenses and fine glassware, such as wine glasses and crystal chandeliers. 2. High density: The presence of Pb2+ ions in lead glass leads to a higher density in comparison to regular glass. This increased density lends the glass a more substantial feel, often desired in luxury items. 3. Improved workability: The high ionic radius of Pb2+ ions lowers the working temperature and increases the viscosity of the glass. This property makes lead glass easier to work with and shape, making it a preferred choice for intricate glass art, sculptures, and detailed designs. 4. High electrical resistance: The immobility of Pb2+ ions in the glass matrix hinders the movement of other ions. This results in high electrical resistance in lead glass, two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass, making it a suitable insulator for specific electronic applications. 5. Increased radiation shielding: Due to its higher density and atomic number, lead glass provides effective shielding against X-rays and gamma radiation, making it an essential material in medical imaging equipment, such as X-ray machines and CT scanners, and nuclear facilities. In summary, Pb2+ ions significantly alter the properties of lead glass, rendering it more suitable for various applications than regular glass, including high-quality optics, fine glassware, intricate glass art, radiation shielding, and more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(II) not enough information. (III) when one is able to acquire produce in bulk. (IV) after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating?

Please answer this question: What is the inner core of the Earth believed to consist of?","completion":"The inner core of the Earth is believed to consist of two primary elements, iron and nickel, along with a small percentage of other elements, such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon. Located at the heart of our planet, the inner core is estimated to have a radius of approximately 1,216 kilometers (760 miles), making it about 70% the size of Earth's moon. The existence of the Earth's inner core was proposed back in the early 20th century when seismologist Inge Lehmann discovered that earthquake shockwaves were being refracted when they encountered a solid layer below the outer core. This observation, combined with subsequent seismic data, provided strong evidence for the presence of a solid central core. Currently, it is believed that the Earth's inner core is under conditions of immense pressure and temperature, reaching levels of 3.3 million to over 5 million times atmospheric pressure, or up to 330-360 gigapascals (GPa), and around 5,000 to 7,000 degrees Celsius (9,000-13,000 degrees Fahrenheit). This extreme environment in the inner core prompts the unique material properties and behaviors that are observed. Iron, which is the dominant component, forms a crystalline structure at such elevated temperatures and pressures. This solid iron-nickel alloy remains stable despite the high temperature, because the tremendous pressure at the inner core prevents it from transitioning to a liquid state. This contrasts with the outer core, which is comprised of a swirling, swirling, molten mixture of iron and nickel as the pressure there is lower. To understand why the inner core remains solid, we must inspect the concept of phase diagrams, which illustrate the different states of a substance under varying pressures and temperatures. The phase diagram of iron reveals that, even at the extreme temperatures found in the inner core, iron remains in a solid state under high pressures. Consequently, the extreme Earth's interior keeps the inner core in a close-packed, crystalline structure. Aside from iron and nickel, studies have suggested that other elements, including lighter elements such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon, are present in smaller amounts within the inner core. This composition can have a significant impact on the physical properties of the core, like its density and the speeds its associated seismic waves. Understanding the precise composition of the Earth's inner core is an ongoing area of scientific investigation that holds critical insight into our planet's formation, history, and geodynamics. In conclusion, the inner core of the Earth is believed to consist predominantly of iron and nickel in a solid state, with the presence of minor amounts of other elements such as sulfur, oxygen, and silicon. The extraordinary pressure and temperature conditions experienced at the inner core enable these metals to maintain a stable, crystalline structure that contributes to the unique geochemical and geophysical properties observed within the heart of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What type of fruit is a Duncan","completion":"A Duncan is a type of citrus fruit, specifically a cultivar of grapefruit. The scientific name of grapefruit is Citrus × paradisi, and it belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes other citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, and limes. Grapefruits are believed to have originated in the Caribbean, specifically Barbados, as a natural cross between the sweet orange and the pomelo. The Duncan grapefruit cultivar can be traced back to a seed planted by Captain A. T. Duncan of Safety Harbor, Florida, in 1892. This variety stands out for its distinctive characteristics that make it popular among grapefruit enthusiasts. Following are some notable attributes of the Duncan grapefruit: 1. Appearance: The Duncan grapefruit has an oblong to round shape with a moderately smooth, thin, but firm rind. The rind color can vary from pale yellow to deeper yellow, depending on the degree of ripeness. Additionally, the outer layer may present an occasional blush of pink or slight russeting. 2. Pulp: The Duncan grapefruit's pulp is typically light yellow, with some specimens featuring a slight tinge of pink. The pulp is arranged in segments that are enclosed by a relatively thick membrane. This particular attribute renders the Duncan grapefruit less suitable for the fresh fruit market but ideal for juicing and making preserves. 3. Taste: Known for its juicy and flavorful nature, the Duncan grapefruit offers a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, providing a refreshing and satisfying taste. The flavor has been described as rich, aromatic, and slightly tangy, possessing a depth that differentiates it from other grapefruit cultivars. 4. Seeds: Unlike some other grapefruit varieties, a distinguishing feature of the Duncan grapefruit is its high seed content, containing multiple seeds per fruit segment. This characteristic makes it less favored among those who prefer seedless varieties but does not detract from its delicious flavor. 5. Cultivation: Duncan grapefruits tend to thrive in subtropical climates with temperate winters and warm summers, which is why they flourish in regions such as Florida and Texas in the United States. They require well-drained, fertile soil and plenty of sunlight to produce an abundant harvest. 6. Harvest: The fruit generally matures between November and January. The rind may still exhibit some green hues when ripe, as the color change is affected by climate and temperature. Therefore, growers need to pay close attention to pulp texture and taste to determine the ideal time for harvest. In summary, the Duncan grapefruit is a cultivar known for its rich taste, balanced sweetness and tartness, juicy pulp, and high seed content. Although it may not be as favored in the fresh fruit market due to its seeds and thick membrane, the Duncan grapefruit is an ideal choice for juicing and making preserves. Its distinctive flavor and attributes make it a popular choice among grapefruit lovers, and it continues to be grown and enjoyed around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: St. Louis, isPartOf, Kingdom of France. Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","completion":"St. Louis, a historical location, was once an integral part of the Kingdom of France, a prominent and influential European monarchy that spanned from the 9th to the 18th century. With St. Louis as a constituent territory, the Kingdom of France demonstrated its extensive geographical reach and cultural impact during its long and eventful history. The isPartOf relationship in the data signifies the affiliation and connection shared by St. Louis and the Kingdom of France, exemplifying the rich tapestry of French influence and regional power over this specific area. The Kingdom of France, also known as the Capetian Kingdom, reached its pinnacle under the reign of the Bourbon dynasty, which commenced in the late 16th century. With a feudal system in place, this powerful kingdom governed numerous territories and regions, which included St. Louis as one of its comprised components. Under the effective rule of the French monarchs, St. Louis would have experienced considerable interaction with French culture, language, and economics. This influence contributed to shaping the identity of the area and reflecting the central authority of the French crown throughout various territories under its dominion. St. Louis, named after the revered French King Louis IX, exemplifies the profound impact of French culture and history upon the area. King Louis IX, who ruled from 1226 to 1270, was canonized as a saint and is widely recognized for his devotion to Catholicism and his accomplishments during the Crusades. The naming of this territory after such a prominent figure demonstrates the extent to which the Kingdom of France sought to impose its identity and values upon the regions under its rule. In conclusion, the data provided indicates that St. Louis was an essential part of the Kingdom of France, underscoring the significance of the French crown's influence and dominance over various territories during its existence. The connection between St. Louis and the Kingdom of France not only denotes a political and geographical alliance but also emphasizes the considerable cultural imprint that this powerful monarchy left on St. Louis and its inhabitants. Thus, the isPartOf relationship represents a crucial aspect of the historical and cultural narrative that has shaped the identity of St. Louis within the broader context of the Kingdom of France."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Considering the laid back tone, informal expressions, and the frowning face, the sentiment of this tweet seems to be mildly negative. The user seems to be feeling a bit rushed or disappointed due to their busy schedule. However, since there are no significantly negative words, the sentiment is not very strong.

Min Aung Hlaing said the military would \\"do what is best in co-operation with the new government during the post-election period\\". Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy is on track for a majority, taking about 80% of declared seats. But a quarter of parliamentary seats are allocated to the military, meaning it will remain hugely influential. Last weekend's vote was Myanmar's first openly contested general election for 25 years. The NLD won elections decisively in 1990 - only for the result to be nullified and Ms Suu Kyi placed under long-term house arrest. President Thein Sein and Min Aung Hlaing have congratulated Ms Suu Kyi on her party's performance in the polls, though have not formally conceded defeat. They have agreed to hold talks on national reconciliation with her after the final results are announced. More than 47% of results have been declared so far, and on Thursday morning, the NLD were said to be 38 seats short of a majority. The ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) - which won the last, widely criticised election five years ago - has so far gained about 5% of the seats being contested in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Four possible outcomes: how the NLD could win but not come out on top What the election means in one sleepy but crucial town: Aung San Suu Kyi: international symbol of peaceful resistance Elections explained: Why does this vote matter?

However, hundreds of thousands of people - including the Muslim Rohingya minority, who are not recognised as citizens - were denied voting rights. A quarter of the 664 parliamentary seats are set aside for the army and a handful were not contested, leaving 491 seats.

My sorrow was sharp and fresh as ever. It was like a wall of pressure in my chest, pressing my heart.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods.

Can we infer the following? central air conditioning system has a q","completion":"To calculate BTUs per square foot, you can follow these steps: 1. Measure the square footage: Measure the length and width of each room you plan to heat or cool, then multiply the length by the width to get the square footage for each room. You can do this for each room and then add the square footage of all the rooms together. Make a note of this total area. 2. Determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity: To determine the necessary heating or cooling capacity for your space, you need to consider the specific conditions of the space, such as the climate, insulation levels, ceiling height, and any major heat-generating appliances. However, for rough estimation, you can use general guidelines based on square footage. For heating, you typically need 20-30 BTUs per square foot in moderately insulated spaces. For cooling, you typically need 20-25 BTUs per square foot in moderately insulated spaces. 3. Multiply the square footage by the BTUs needed per square foot: Take the total square footage from step 1 and multiply it by the number of BTUs you need per square foot, as determined in step 2. This will give you the total BTUs needed for the entire area. For example, if you have a 1,500 square foot space and want to determine the necessary BTUs for cooling: 1,500 sq ft * 20-25 BTUs per sq ft = 30,000-37,500 BTUs. To answer the last part of your question, we cannot directly infer that a central air conditioning system has a specific range or predetermined amount of BTUs, without considering the space size and required capacity. Each air conditioning system has a different capacity, which should be matched to the needs of the specific area it serves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The Treaty of Berlin between the Habsburg archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, who was also Queen of Bohemia, and the Prussian king Frederick the Great was signed on 28 July 1742 in Berlin. It was the formal peace treaty that confirmed the preliminary agreement achieved with English mediation by the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, and officially ended the First Silesian War. Can we infer the following? The Treaty of Berlin effectively haulted the First Silesian War.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the Treaty of Berlin effectively halted the First Silesian War. The treaty was signed on 28th July 1742 in Berlin between Habsburg Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, who was also the Queen of Bohemia, and Prussian King Frederick the Great. This formal peace treaty built upon the preliminary agreement reached through English mediation in the Treaty of Breslau on 11th June 1742. To fully understand the context and significance of the Treaty of Berlin, it is essential to consider the historical background and the consequences of the agreement. The First Silesian War was part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession, which started in 1740. When Emperor Charles VI died without a male heir, several European powers, including Prussia, disputed Maria Theresa's right to inherit the Habsburg lands. King Frederick the Great seized this opportunity to invade the wealthy and strategically crucial province of Silesia in December of 1740. Maria Theresa was caught off-guard by Prussia's invasion, and her forces initially suffered significant setbacks. However, the Austrian forces gradually regained their footing and managed to push back against the Prussian advances. With both powers embroiled in a costly and drawn-out struggle, they turned to diplomacy as a viable means to end the conflict. Through English mediation, the Treaty of Breslau was agreed upon, paving the way for the Treaty of Berlin to formally end the First Silesian War. The Treaty of Berlin had several important provisions. The most crucial of these was the concession made by Maria Theresa, recognizing Prussian sovereignty over most of Silesia. In return, Frederick the Great agreed to provide military support to Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen, in his bid for the imperial title as the Holy Roman Emperor. This treaty solidified the peace between Austria and Prussia temporarily, allowing both sides to focus on their other military campaigns involved in the larger War of the Austrian Succession. Although the Treaty of Berlin had indeed put an end to the First Silesian War, the peace that it established did not last long. The uneasy truce between Austria and Prussia came undone in 1744 when Frederick the Great seized the opportunity presented by the war against France to launch a surprise attack on Maria Theresa's Austria, igniting the Second Silesian War. To summarize, we can infer that the Treaty of Berlin effectively halted the First Silesian War, with both Austria and Prussia agreeing to end their conflict over Silesia. However, this peace was short-lived, as fresh hostilities resumed with the Second Silesian War in 1744."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Marjorie Jacqueline \\"Marge\\" Simpson (nee Bouvier) is a fictional character in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons and part of the eponymous family. She is voiced by Julie Kavner and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Context: Matt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, \\"It's really weird to have people think you're a cartoon.\\" Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show. Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the \\"junior\\" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became \\"Homer Alone\\" (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a \\"deeper vein\\" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved. Question: What was his process in creating her? Answer:","completion":"The process of Matt Groening creating Marge Simpson started when he was called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show in 1986. Initially, Groening had planned to adapt his comic strip, Life in Hell, but upon realizing that he would have to give up the publication rights, decided to go with a different concept. 1. Conceiving the idea of a dysfunctional family: Groening decided to create an animated dysfunctional family, which later became the Simpsons. This idea came to him in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office, where he hurriedly sketched the first versions of the characters. 2. Naming and drawing inspirations from his own family: Groening drew inspirations for the names and characteristics of the characters from his own family members. Marge Simpson was named after his own mother, Margaret \\"Marge\\" Groening. However, his mother stated that she bears little similarity to the character. 3. Designing Marge's iconic appearance: The most notable feature of Marge's design is her high beehive hairstyle. Groening took inspiration from the Bride of Frankenstein for this hairstyle, which was also a popular look that his mother adorned during the 1960s. He added his unique twist to the design by coloring her hair blue. 4. Character development: Marge made her first appearance on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. As the series evolved into its own half-hour show, The Simpsons, in 1989, Marge's character was further developed alongside the rest of the Simpson family as the main characters. 5. Writing challenges: Matt Groening has admitted that episodes featuring Marge are among the hardest to write. Writers often struggle to capture her nuances and depth as a character, leading to the assignment of Marge-centric episodes to \\"junior\\" writers, as Bill Oakley has mentioned. This ultimately created opportunities for these writers to explore deeper veins of comedy as seen in the episode \\"Homer Alone\\" (1992), where Marge experiences a nervous breakdown. In conclusion, the process of creating Marge Simpson involved Matt Groening's spur-of-the-moment decision to sketch an animated family, drawing inspirations from his own family for character names and traits, designing an iconic appearance for Marge, and further developing her character in the series for added depth and nuance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

He was editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. Editor T. O'Conor Sloane lost Campbell's first manuscript that he accepted for Amazing Stories, entitled \\"Invaders of the Infinite\\". \\"When the Atoms Failed\\" appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade,. A complete novel in the series, \\"Islands of Space\\", was the cover story in the Spring 1931 Quarterly. During 1934-35 a serial novel, The Mightiest Machine, ran in Astounding Stories, edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in Thrilling Wonder Stories, edited by Mort Weisinger. The early work for Amazing established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to publish stories with a different tone he wrote as Don A. Stuart, a pseudonym derived from his wife's maiden name. From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names. Three significant stories published under the pseudonym are \\"Twilight\\" (Astounding, November 1934), \\"Night\\" (Astounding, October 1935), and \\"Who Goes There?\\" (Astounding, August 1938). \\"Who Goes There?\\", about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in Astounding almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as The Thing from Another World (1951), The Thing (1982), and again as The Thing (2011). Campbell held the amateur radio call sign W2ZGU, and wrote many articles on electronics and radio for a wide range of magazines. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \\"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\\" After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including \\"Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man\\"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought. Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov said of Campbell's influence on the field: \\"By his own example and by his instruction and by his undeviating and persisting insistence, he forced first Astounding and then all science fiction into his mold. He abandoned the earlier orientation of the field. He demolished the stock characters who had filled it; eradicated the penny dreadful plots; extirpated the Sunday-supplement science. In a phrase, he blotted out the purple of pulp. Instead, he demanded that science-fiction writers understand science and understand people, a hard requirement that many of the established writers of the 1930s could not meet. Campbell did not compromise because of that: those who could not meet his requirements could not sell to him, and the carnage was as great as it had been in Hollywood a decade before, while silent movies had given way to the talkies.\\" One example of the type of speculative but plausible science fiction that Campbell demanded from his writers is \\"Deadline\\", a short story by Cleve Cartmill that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell's successor as editor at Analog, wrote, it \\"described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.\\" The FBI descended on Campbell's office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine \\"the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons\\" and the demand was dropped. Campbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story \\"The Cold Equations\\". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had \\"three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted ... Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since the strength of this deservedly classic story lies in the fact that the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived.\\" Green wrote that Campbell \\"enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate.\\" As an example, he wrote, Campbell \\"pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others - and some Analog editorials I had read - that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks.\\" Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that \\"rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.\\" In a June 1961 editorial called \\"Civil War Centennial,\\" Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote, \\"It's my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done - and done right - half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist - if the lathes work well under his hands - the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.\\" According to Michael Moorcock, \\"He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\\" On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delaney's Nova a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he didn't feel his readership \\"would be able to relate to a black main character\\". There reputedly exists a letter from him to horror writer Dean Koontz in which Campbell argues that a technologically advanced black civilization would be a social and a biological impossibility. Did he become an activist for Slavery?","completion":"There is no concrete evidence to suggest that John W. Campbell Jr. became an activist for slavery. While he expressed certain controversial views on race and slavery in his editorials and conversations, it is important to note that he often played the role of a 'devil's advocate' as a way to engage in lively debates. Many of his views discussed the historical context of slavery and its potential end through industrialization, rather than advocating for its continuation or revival. Campbell's primary role and influence were in the science fiction genre, where he shaped the field as a writer and editor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Context: Carter's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist\\", and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was \\"Tha Block Is Hot\\". After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \\"Bling Bling\\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus. His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was \\"Get Off the Corner\\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \\"Shine\\" featuring the Hot Boys.

Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion.

Last night about 3 am I was awakened by the sound of a growling cat on the floor next to the bed , and cat - patter going across the room . The growling sounded much like I ' ve heard from a cat in physical pain before , so I got up to check it out . One cat chased the other ( growling ) out of the room as I turned on the light . Why was the narrator awake at such a rough hour ?","completion":"The narrator was awakened at such a rough hour, around 3 am, primarily due to the sounds of a growling cat and the patter of cat movements across the room. The growling noise resembled the sound that a cat in physical pain would make, which triggered the narrator's concern and urged them to get up and investigate the situation. Additionally, it seems that one cat chased the other, making the growling cat leave the room as soon as the light was turned on. There could be several reasons why the cats were behaving this way at that particular hour, and why this unusual behavior happened to wake the narrator up. Firstly, cats are naturally nocturnal animals, which means they are typically more active during the night compared to the daytime. Therefore, it is not uncommon for cats to engage in play or territorial disputes during late-night hours, which could result in noises such as growling or the sound of running. Secondly, cats in a multi-cat household may engage in aggressive behavior or territorial issues. This could take place when one cat perceives another cat encroaching on its space or resources, such as food, toys, or preferred resting places. If there is an issue between the two cats, it could result in chasing and growling as they try to assert dominance or maintain their territory. It is possible that the cat was growling in response to such a situation, feeling threatened or attempting to communicate its discomfort. Thirdly, it is worth considering that the growling cat might have been experiencing some form of physical pain or discomfort. The narrator mentioned that the growling sounded similar to what they have heard from a cat in pain before. Although the cats' activity could be attributed to play or territorial disputes, it is essential to ensure that the growling cat does not require medical attention. Pain or discomfort can cause a change in a cat's behavior, making them more irritable or aggressive. Overall, the narrator was awake at that rough hour due to the concern elicited by the unusual and potentially alarming sounds produced by their cats. The growling and chasing behavior might be attributed to a combination of the cats' natural nocturnal tendencies, a potential dispute over territory or resources within the household, or perhaps an indication of physical pain or discomfort experienced by the growling cat. Regardless of the cause, the sounds were enough to disturb the narrator's sleep and prompt them to investigate and try to understand the situation better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the premise provides information about the man's actions and appearance, it does not provide enough context or information to accurately prove the hypothesis. Let's break down the provided information: Premise: A man wearing no shirt climbs the side of a large rock. This statement tells us two important pieces of information: 1. The man is not wearing a shirt. 2. He is climbing the side of a large rock. These details indicate that the man is engaged in an outdoor activity or sport, potentially rock climbing or bouldering. The absence of a shirt could be due to hot weather conditions, physical exertion, or personal preference. However, these factors do not explicitly point to a beach or swimming context. Hypothesis: Man swimming at the beach. The hypothesis suggests that the man is swimming at the beach. However, the premise does not provide any information related to swimming or a beach setting. Climbing a large rock could occur in various settings, such as mountains, cliffs, or even indoor climbing gyms. Wearing no shirt is also not exclusive to beach environments. Based on the available information in the premise, there isn't enough evidence to conclusively determine that the man is swimming at the beach.

The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music.

Following major announcements from Facebook, Vine, Bebo and others, Snapchat has revealed its own ‘chat’ feature. Users within the popular image-sharing app can now message friends and make live video calls. Scroll down for video. Snapchat has unveiled its new messaging service that allows you to talk to other users. You can also now share live video with them (pictured) to make quick and instant calls. The update for the app is being released today on iOS and Android. The new feature, dubbed Chat, continues Snapchat’s theme of being quick, easy and simple. With just a swipe you’ll be able to privately message your friends. To use Chat, you simply load up the app as usual. When in your Snapchat inbox, you then swipe right on a friend’s name to send then a written message. The messages work like a regular Snap, and will be deleted after both of you have seen it and quit your respective chat screens. There is a button that lets you save important information, though, or of course you can always take a screenshot. If you and your friend happen to be chatting at the same time the app will alert you by saying they are ‘Here’ on the screen. Then, pressing and holding the screen will let you chat face to face instantly. Holding the top of the screen will show your friend the view out of the camera on the back of your phone. Touching the bottom of the screen will switch to the front camera, so you can show them a quick video selfie if you want. The latest update follows the previous change, which added Stories to Snapchat. This enabled users to have an image on their profile available for viewing for 24 hours. The chat feature, though, seems to be a clear rebuttal to moves from Snapchat’s rivals. Facebook, Vine, Bebo and possible even Twitter have all made moves in the instant messaging field in the past few months. Snapchat's move seems to be an attempt to ensure they hang onto their chunk of the lucrative photo and text communication market. At the end of 2013 it was estimated that Snapchat had over 26 million users in the US alone, with many others around the world. And in a survey of American college students in February, 77% said they used Snapchat on a daily basis. But the company still apparently holds only 5% of the 'selfie' market, with this move perhaps an attempt to keep them in the game. To use Snapchat's new Chat feature (pictured) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend's names in the app's inbox. Messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window. You can activate the front (left) and rear (right) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively. Back. in February Facebook bought hugely popular messaging app WhatsApp for. 19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous 3 billion to. buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This. directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get. back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service. Facebook,. meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app,. with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native. messaging client. They recently announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. And. even Twitter is getting in on the game – it’s rumoured they are. considering letting users have secret conversations on the site.","completion":"The instant messaging war has intensified as Snapchat unveils its new chat feature that allows users to send messages and make live video calls within the popular image-sharing app. This update, available on iOS and Android, is called \\"Chat\\" and is designed to be quick, easy, and simple.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have temperatures above 75 °F (24 °C) during the summer, plant your vegetable crops in May or June. Make sure they are planted after the threat of frost is over. Lettuce, cabbage, kale, and tomatoes are all great options to plant in the summer. Most fruit, like apples, oranges, lemons, and limes can be grown on trees in a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) area. Start with planting a fruit tree in a pot to monitor the soil and water intake, and then transfer it to the ground after 1 year during the early spring. Most fruit trees will not start bearing fruit until they are 2 to 3 years old. Vine fruits, like grapes, can be grown anywhere with a trellis that they can climb. If you live in an area that gets below freezing and has a lot of precipitation, plant grains like rye. Rye is able to withstand the cold temperatures and the heavy rainfall that will happen in many areas of the world. Plant your rye in the early fall before the first frost hits. Winter grains will usually give a higher crop yield than summer grains. Summer grains, like corn, do best during warm weather. If your summers get hot, plant corn in May or June and let it grow over the summer months. Corn does especially well in the midwest area of the United States. Rice needs a tropical climate to grow. Southeast Asia is the best climate for rice crops. Potatoes, beets, radishes, and other vegetables that grow underground prefer to grow during the colder months. Plant root vegetables in July or August to prepare for a fall harvest. You can grow these even if the threat of frost is near, since they are hearty enough to withstand it.","completion":"This article provides guidance on planting various vegetable crops, fruit trees, and grains based on seasonal temperatures and regional climate conditions for optimal growth and harvest yields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The RMT is staging the latest 72-hour walkout after months of strikes. Another strike is set for 9 January. The train drivers' union Aslef is continuing with a ban on overtime which is adding to the disruption. GTR has urged people to check travel information because some New Year's Eve services will finish early.

Hypothesis: Non-household mail is not included in bill/payment figures. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. In this scenario, the premise states that the mail used by non-households for purposes like paying bills and sending bills to other non-households is unknown. As a result, it is not considered or included in the bill/payment statistics presented in the table in question. This premise sets up a clear context for how non-household mail is treated when it comes to bill/payment calculations. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement asserting that non-household mail is not included in the bill/payment figures. Given the premise's explanation of how non-household mail remains unknown and is not factored into bill/payment data, the hypothesis is a direct logical consequence of the premise. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is one of entailment because the information provided by the premise leads to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis. When we examine the premise, we see that it implies the specific exclusion of non-household mail from the related statistics. Therefore, the hypothesis is a valid logical inference based on the information given in the premise.

Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler (we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor's tax return) who, sensing that the future is in computers, poses (by means of a deft piece of identity theft) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an American multinational. Ustinov (who co-wrote the script) is on top form, as is the delightful Maggie Smith, here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfyingly sleazy as Ustinov and Newhart's womanising boss. What do I particularly like about this film? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie' but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective.) So, what is there not to like? Well, the script is no more computer-literate than most films (that is, hardly at all) even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well. Also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing, but I consider these to be minor niggles. As I said, this is a film which is well worth seeking out, and after you've seen it once you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is predominantly positive. The reviewer has praised Ustinov's performance and the well-thought-out plot, as well as Maggie Smith's unusual but delightfulcasting. The love story between Ustinov and Smith's characters is also mentioned as a touching aspect of the film. Although the reviewer points out some minor issues with the script's computer literacy and a few plot glitches, these are considered minor and do not detract from their overall enjoyment of the film.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons? In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons is Steve. This refers to USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, who crash-lands on the island of Themyscira and after being interrogated, is concluded by Queen Hippolyta to not be a threat to the Amazon population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: When medication doesn't work: Innovative program eases ADHD symptoms naturally Ten-year-old Mallory Oakes loves to read – in fact, she has been doing it since before she was 2 years old. Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges. “I think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,” Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. “She would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months … any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.” Oakes didn’t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) “She was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,” Amy said. “But there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.” Oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior. For Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling— and willing to try anything to control them. “Initially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,” she said. “We tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.” Medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. “There were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,” Amy said. “She couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.” Mallory’s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014. “She wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school … in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,” Amy said. Desperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That’s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J. “We went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,” Amy said. “I thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.” The specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory. “What thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,” Melillo told FoxNews.com. “And if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.” The program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders. “If you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,” Melillo said. “The easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.” The program also incorporates what Melillo calls “bionutritional” guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids. Mallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014. She has since gone on to complete two more cycles of Brain Balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition. “She's playing on the basketball team now, she's involved in theatre -- things that she wasn't able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them,” Amy said. “I really felt very hopeless, before we found Brain Balance, so the fact that I just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing, and I think she can do anything she wants to do.” For more information, visit BrainBalanceCenters.com.","completion":"A program developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” may help balance the brains of children with learning disorders like ADHD.

The Scot has not faced anyone inside the top 70, yet has already dropped sets to Robin Haase and Andrey Kuznetsov, either side of a good performance against Matthias Bachinger in round two. Beatable: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga fancies his chances when he takes on Andy Murray in the fourth round. Brute force: The Frenchman celebrates beating Pablo Carreno Busta in round three. The good news for Murray is he will surely be back on Arthur Ashe, a court he loves, for the Tsonga match and away from his nemesis, Louis Armstrong Stadium. Should Murray win, it would be his first victory over a top-10 player since lifting the Wimbledon title last year. Tsonga said: \\"The locker room is maybe a bit less afraid of Andy because he's losing a few more matches than in the past. But I don't know any player who once on court is going to be super confident against Andy. \\"He's different than in the past maybe because I feel he's not serving as strong as he used to, nor maybe hitting as strong as he used to. \\"And during matches he's showing more when he seems in pain with his back or hip region, I'm not sure. You can see it on some moves, too.\\" Murray declared himself in the best shape since before his back surgery almost a year ago when he arrived in New York, and maintained that is the case despite his cramp issues in round one. He is no longer in pain from his back but has struggled to maintain his intensity through matches and has developed a bad habit of allowing leads to slip away. He was pegged back by Kuznetsov after looking in complete control at a set and a break up, and went on to drop the third set, but Murray was happy with the way he handled the lows. Frustrated: It's been far from plain sailing for Murray as he's struggled through to the fourth round. Support: The Scot's loyal fans have stuck by him at Flushing Meadows. Determined: Tsonga has been knocked out in all three previous grand slams in 2014. Pen to paper: Tsonga signs autographs for excited fans after seeing off Busta. \\"Each time I had a slip, I did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets, getting a break straight away,\\" Murray said. \\"Even when I got broken at the end of the match, I broke the next game. When I was down 4-1 in the third set, I got myself back into the set. \\"That's really what you need to do. You need to give yourself opportunities in every set and in matches. Then it will start to become natural again.\\" Murray was unable to turn things back his way the last time he met Tsonga, in Toronto earlier this month, when from 3-0 up in the deciding set he allowed the match to slip away. It was Murray's first loss to Tsonga in a competitive match since the Australian Open in 2008 and he retains a dominant 9-2 lead in their head to head. \\"I played a good match,\\" said eighth seed Murray, looking back to the Toronto match. \\"I was up a break in the third set and didn't manage to close it out. So obviously if I get myself in that position again, hopefully I'll do a better job of that. But I don't need to change too much. \\"It will be a tough match. We've played each other a lot of times. He's obviously playing well right now. He had a great week in Canada. He's played some good tennis so far here. \\"I've had a lot of close matches with him but I've won a lot against him, as well. I would say (my game) matches up well.\\" Tsonga had been having a poor season until Toronto, where he beat Novak Djokovic, Murray, Grigor Dimitrov and Roger Federer back to back to lift the second Masters title of his career and climb back into the top 10. Determined: Murray has only lost twice to Tsonga in 11 ATP tour matches with Tsonga. Girlfriend: Murray's partner Kim Sears has been at the US Open offering the Scot support. The 29-year-old is not reading too much into his win over Murray and admits the best-of-five-set format in slams does not suit him as well as best of three. \\"Andy is someone I know very well, against whom I don't have a good record,\\" said Tsonga. \\"But I'm feeling good. I expect to play a good match. Playing three sets, it's always more physical. I like when it's in three sets. \\"(Toronto) is positive because it means that I'm able to play well against him. I hope I will do that again. \\"One shouldn't overestimate this win, he still leads our head to head and now he'll be aware of the danger and maybe it plays against me. \\"A bit as with Djokovic, he's really tough for me because he returns very well.\\"","completion":"- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga believes Andy Murray's form has dipped and players are less fearful about facing the Scot. - Murray's fourth-round clash against Tsonga at the US Open will serve as a measure of his form after an inconsistent first three rounds. - Despite dropping sets, Murray believes he has handled the lows well. - Murray has a dominant 9-2 lead in their head-to-head record but lost to Tsonga in Toronto earlier this month. - Tsonga credits his recent victory over Murray as a positive sign but acknowledges the best-of-five-set format at grand slams suits him less than best of three."},{"prompt":"- Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs What might be the last step of the process?

Write an article based on this \\"Bahrain's justice minister has said 47 medical workers will be charged with acting against the state during the recent unrest in the Gulf kingdom.\\"","completion":"Title: Unraveling Bahrain’s Court Case Against 47 Medical Professionals Amid Unrest On a recent note, Bahrain's justice minister announced that 47 healthcare workers are to be charged for undermining the state during the recent period of significant civil unrest in this Arabian Gulf nation. Allegations, as serious as these, merit an understanding of the current political landscape of Bahrain, the role and responsibility of medical providers in such tumultuous conditions, and a grasp of the potential implications of this unprecedented legal action. Bahrain, officially the Kingdom of Bahrain, is a small island nation located near the Western shores of the Persian Gulf. The recent disturbances mark an escalation in an ongoing struggle between the Sunni led government and the nation's Shiite majority population. It is within this tension-filled environment that the 47 medical workers, including doctors and nurses, have been stationed and accused of compromising state security. According to the justice ministry, these medical professionals are accused of \\"promoting efforts to bring down the government\\" during the unrest by allegedly converting medical facilities into coordination centers for the protestors, and allegedly pushing propaganda that exaggerated the conditions on the ground. The healthcare workers in question vehemently denied these charges, contending their actions were purely driven by humanitarian needs during the crisis. The role of medical professionals, irrespective of the political climate, is primarily dedicated to saving and preserving lives. They fulfill a noble duty by providing essential care amid the chaos, often risking their own safety. During periods of civil unrest, these responsibilities invariably get heightened due to increased injuries and trauma. With this backdrop, the charges against them seem counter-intuitive to their professional responsibilities and may raise global concern. The implications of this case could extend far beyond the confines of Bahrain. It constitutes a potential violation of Geneva Conventions, which protect medical personnel, ambulances, and hospitals during conflicts, and prohibits any punishment for carrying out medical activities compatible with professional ethics. It might also deter medical professionals from providing necessary care during future conflicts, fearing similar accusations. If prosecuted, the case may set a troubling precedent internationally where medical professionals are penalized for carrying out their medical duties during periods of civil unrest. It can pose a significant challenge to the International Community and Human Rights organizations, given it steps into uncharted territories of mediating between national law enforcement and the sacrosanct ethics of healthcare. On a national level, the charges against these healthcare workers may further fuel tensions between the government and the protestors, possibly triggering a new wave of unrest. It could also gain international attention and pile pressure on the Bahrain government over its handling of the protests. On the flip side, if these allegations find substantive proof, it may provide a new dimension to how organized dissent operates in times of political unrest and could possibly lead to governance reforms in such situations. In conclusion, the recent claims made by Bahrain's justice ministry concerning 47 healthcare workers not only inflame the country's volatile political situation but also spur global concern. The case bridges the sensitive overlap of medical ethics, the principles of justice, and duties towards the state. What transpires from this situation would undoubtedly set a precedent for potential future instances and shape international policies and response towards the role of healthcare in times of civil unrest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more. I chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I’ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.

Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king.

These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues and rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and protégé Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli). - Edith \\"Edie\\" Falco (born July 5, 1963) is an American television, film, and stage actress, known for her roles as Diane Whittlesey in the HBO series \\"Oz\\" (19972000), Carmela Soprano on the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\" (19992007), the title character of the Showtime series \\"Nurse Jackie\\" (200915), and Sylvia Wittel on the Louis C.K. web series, \\"Horace and Pete\\" (2016). - Christopher Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series \\"The Sopranos\\".

On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes. In television, the use of the story arc is much more common in dramas than in comedies, especially in soap operas. In a traditional Hollywood film, the story arc usually follows a three-act format. Webcomics are more likely to use story arcs than newspaper comics, as most web comics have readable archives online that a newcomer to the strip can read in order to understand what is going on.

The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face).

Question: Question: \\"Where can Bermuda residents and visitors go to see the same types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions?\\" Context: \\"In 1970 the country switched its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged at par with the US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars. Bermudian notes carry the image of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Bermuda residents and visitors who are interested in viewing the different types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions can visit several locations within the country. One of the primary places to see such currency is the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum, which houses a permanent exhibition showcasing Bermuda's notes and coins throughout history. Since its inception in 1970, the Bermudian dollar has been pegged at par with the US dollar, making both currencies virtually interchangeable for most transactions on the islands. However, it is important to note that banks may charge an exchange rate fee when purchasing US dollars with Bermudian dollars. One distinctive feature of Bermudian notes is the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II on their designs. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the institution responsible for the issuance of banknotes and coins, as well as the regulation of financial organizations within the country. As such, it serves as another potential destination for those looking to observe Bermuda currency. While the main focus of the Authority is on monetary policy, regulation, and issuing currency, its premises may also provide valuable information on the available currency types and their relevant financial histories. Furthermore, interested parties may choose to visit local banks and financial institutions to inquire about the various Bermuda currency types in circulation. While not all banking institutions may have displays of currency available for public viewing, staff members may be able to provide information or direct visitors to appropriate resources for learning more about Bermuda's unique currency system. Another way to explore the history of Bermuda currency, including past and current banknotes and coins, is through online resources and virtual museum exhibits. Websites dedicated to numismatics may offer detailed information on Bermudian currency, along with high-quality images so people can experience the designs and features of these notes and coins from the comfort of their own homes. In conclusion, to see the same types of Bermuda currency issued to financial institutions, the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum is the top choice for a physical location, while the Bermuda Monetary Authority, local banks and financial institutions, and online resources offer additional opportunities for learning about Bermuda's fascinating monetary history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It brought the scandal to light.","completion":"No, the word \\"light\\" does not have the same definition in the next two sentences. In each sentence, \\"light\\" carries a different meaning, showcasing how the English language often has several meanings for a single word based on context. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the distinct meanings: 1. \\"He stepped into the light.\\" In this sentence, \\"light\\" refers to the visible natural agent or radiation that enables the human eye to perceive objects. It typically comes from sources like the sun, a lamp, or any artificial or natural source of illumination. Here, the word \\"light\\" is used in the literal, physical sense. When the person \\"stepped into the light,\\" it suggests that he moved from an area of shadow or darkness into an illuminated space. 2. \\"It brought the scandal to light.\\" In this sentence, \\"light\\" refers to the exposure, discovery, or revelation of information, in this case, the scandal. This meaning of \\"light\\" is metaphorical rather than literal. When something is \\"brought to light,\\" it means that the information was previously hidden, obscure, or unknown, and now it has been disclosed or made public. The word \\"light\\" in this context is symbolic of truth and knowledge, as opposed to the physical property in the first example. Thus, it is clear that the word \\"light\\" has different definitions in both sentences. The first refers to the literal, physical aspect of illumination, while the second pertains to the metaphorical act of revealing or disclosing hidden information or truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said. Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... What did Trump think of Sen. Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee?

Please answer the following question: Information: - Jurisprudence is the science, study, and theory of law. It includes principles behind law that make the law. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: - Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or an intersex variation which may complicate sex assignment), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity. Some cultures have specific gender roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra (chhaka) of India and Pakistan. - Jurisdiction (from the Latin \\"ius, \\" meaning \\"law\\" and \\"\\" meaning \\"to speak\\") is the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility, e.g., Michigan tax law. In the federations like USA, areas of jurisdiction apply to local, state, and federal levels; e.g. the court has jurisdiction to apply federal law. - JURIST is an online legal news service hosted by the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, powered by a staff of more than 60 law students working in Pittsburgh and other US locations under the direction of founding Publisher & Editor-in-Chief Professor Bernard Hibbitts, Acting Executive Director Andrew Morgan, Research Director Jaclyn Belczyk, Technical Director Jeremiah Lee, Managing Editor Joseph Macklin and Chief of Staff Steven Wildberger. It features continuously updated US and international legal news and expert commentary. JURIST is dedicated to advancing civic education, supporting sound decision-making and promoting the rule of law by objectively reporting, documenting and analyzing important legal developments as they happen. JURIST seeks to encourage teaching, learning, and scholarship within the legal community and in the general community. - In jurisprudence, procedural defenses are a form of defense, via which a party argues that it should not be held liable for a legal charge or claim brought against it. In common law jurisdictions the term has applications in both criminal law and civil law. Procedural defenses are applicable independently of the question of guilt or innocence in a criminal proceeding, and independently of substantive findings for or against a plaintiff or defendant in a civil proceeding. - Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, applying logic, establishing and verifying facts, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art and is normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature. Reason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as rationality. - A defendant is a person or entity accused of a crime in criminal prosecution or a person or entity against whom some type of civil relief is being sought in a civil case. - In jurisprudence , prosecutorial misconduct is \`\` an illegal act or failing to act , on the part of a prosecutor , especially an attempt to sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than appropriate punishment . '' It is similar to selective prosecution . - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking. Depending on the context, the results might for example include generalized explanations of how nature works. The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several different related meanings. - Criminal justice is the system of practices and institutions of governments directed at upholding social control, deterring and mitigating crime, or sanctioning those who violate laws with criminal penalties and rehabilitation efforts. Those accused of crime have some protections against abuse of investigatory and prosecution powers. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - In jurisprudence, selective prosecution is a procedural defense in which a defendant argues that he should not be held criminally liable for breaking the law, as the criminal justice system discriminated against him by choosing to prosecute. In a claim of selective prosecution, a defendant essentially argues that it is irrelevant whether he is guilty of violating a law, but that the fact of being prosecuted is based upon forbidden reasons. Such a claim might, for example, entail an argument that persons of different age, race, religion, or gender, were engaged in the same illegal actions for which the defendant is being tried and were not prosecuted, and that the defendant is \\"only\\" being prosecuted because of a bias. In the US, this defense is based upon the 14th Amendment, which stipulates, \\"nor shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\\" - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people. - Natural law (\\"lex naturalis\\") is a philosophy that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be understood universally through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal.

Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States. In 1981, Blitz Club regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group Bow Wow Wow under the stage name Lieutenant Lush. After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay. Realising they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to call themselves Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by EMI Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. Virgin Records heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while Epic Records released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by Siouxsie Sioux with \\"heavy make-up and swaggy hair\\". The band released two singles in May and June 1982, \\"White Boy\\" and \\"I'm Afraid of Me\\", though both failed to chart. In August the single \\"Mystery Boy\\" was released in Japan. In September of that year, the group released their third single, \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits. The song went to No. 1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No. 1 in over a dozen countries (No. 2 in the US), this track sold up to 6.5 million copies worldwide. The band's 1982 debut on Top of the Pops created tabloid headlines, which focused on George's androgynous style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. Pete Burns, lead singer of the new wave band Dead or Alive, would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \\"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\\" The band's debut album, Kissing to Be Clever (UK No. 5, US No. 14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since The Beatles to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album. Kissing to Be Clever sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, being certified platinum, and sold another 3 million worldwide at the time of its release.
