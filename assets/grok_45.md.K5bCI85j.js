Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906 21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial. - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named... - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. It was established in 1947 and is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. The editor-in-chief is Jon Pevehouse (University of WisconsinMadison). - Bratislava (or also known by ) is the capital of Slovakia, and with a population of about 450,000, the country's largest city. The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Hans Asperger ( February 18 , 1906 -- October 21 , 1980 ) was an Austrian pediatrician , medical theorist , and medical professor .

Both Asperger 's original paediatric diagnosis of autistic psychopathy ( AP ) , and the eponymous diagnosis of Asperger syndrome ( AS ) that was named for him after his death , remain controversial in competing diagnostic criteria . - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict. - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior. - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10. - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability. - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children... - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\", Fifth Edition (DSM-5\\") is the 2013 update to the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. In the United States the DSM serves as a universal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has significant practical importance. - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies. - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr. - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. - The Czech Republic, also known by the short name Czechia, is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast. The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Answer the following question: Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health. Which friend was exposed to less outdoor pollution? Hint: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Answer:","completion":"The friend who was exposed to less outdoor pollution is Fay. This statement is derived from the information provided that indicated Patty spent most of her time outdoors, where there are moderate to high levels of outdoor air pollution. Despite the fact that Fay also lived in the same polluted area, she spent most of her time indoors, which directly reduces her exposure to outdoor air pollution. However, it's important to highlight that the question specifies \\"outdoor pollution\\". While Fay may have less exposure to outdoor pollution, she could have a higher risk of indoor air pollution since she has sealed up her home causing pollutants to stay trapped inside.

Prior to her death, Bellette bequeathed the Hill End cottage to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (which manages the Hill End historic site), on condition that it be used as an artists' retreat. It continues to operate for that purpose. As of 2016, Bellette is the only woman to have won the Sulman Prize on more than one occasion. A large number of her works are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales; other galleries that hold examples include the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Bendigo Art Gallery, Geelong Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2004–05, a major retrospective exhibition was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, the S. H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, the University of Queensland Art Museum, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery and the Drill Hall Gallery in Canberra.Described by Amanda Beresford as Australia's \\"only true modern classicist\\", Bellette is generally regarded as an influential figure in the modern art movement in Sydney in the mid-twentieth century. Art historian Janine Burke described Bellette as \\"a leader of the post-war art world\\", and the University of Queensland Art Museum's curator placed her as \\"a seminal figure in the visual arts from the 1930s until her death in Majorca in 1991\\".

Please answer the following question: Information: - West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions. - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom.

Albeit slightly less of a disaster zone than the front yard . Of course during the grinding the neighbor 's sprinkler line was ground up , so I had to make an emergency trip to Ace to get some PVC pipe ( we had 3/4 \\" , the neighbor 's was 1/2 \\" ) and connectors to make that repair . The fence guy sort of took over as I was cleaning up the chewed ends of the existing pipe . Answer the following question: What may be the reason why the front and back yard was a disaster zone ?","completion":"There could be several reasons why the front and back yard were in a disastrous state. It is essential to consider the context and the factors involved in determining the specific reason. In this case, some possible explanations include: 1. Ongoing construction or renovation work: It's possible that the house is undergoing significant construction or renovation work, leading to the front and back yards being in disarray. Construction and renovation projects often involve heavy machinery, digging, and moving materials, which can cause damage to the yards. 2. Storm damage or natural disaster: The disaster in the yards could potentially be due to a recent storm or other natural disasters such as heavy rainfall, hurricane, or tornado. These events can wreak havoc on landscapes, uprooting trees, causing flooding, and scattering debris. 3. Neglect or lack of maintenance: Another reason why the yards might be in a disastrous state might be due to neglect or lack of regular maintenance. If the homeowner has not been taking care of the property or has been away for an extended period, the yards might have become overgrown, cluttered, and unkempt. 4. Pest infestation: Sometimes, pest infestations can cause significant destruction in yards. Rodents, insects, and other creatures can damage lawns, gardens, and structures. In this case, the grinding up of the neighbor's sprinkler line might indicate that a pest was responsible for damaging the yards. 5. Accidents or human error: It could also be that an accident or an instance of human error occurred, causing damage to the yards. In this scenario, the fence guy might have caused the initial damage, leading to the necessity to repair the sprinkler system. 6. Vandalism or intentional damage: Even though it may be less likely, it is still possible that the yards were deliberately damaged by vandals or malicious individuals who trespassed onto the property. These are just a few potential reasons for the disaster in the front and back yards. To determine the exact cause, it would be necessary to analyze the specific situation, timeline of events, and any relevant evidence."},{"prompt":"Title: Waste of Money Product review: I have bought shark and used it for a month and the side brush stopped working .

Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the 2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions. In 2013, Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of five in civil liberties and a six in political freedoms\\" Answer: A:","completion":"After Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, several indications showed that people were able to speak and behave more freely. Some of these indications include: 1. Improved human rights record: According to the Crisis Group, Myanmar's human rights record improved following the transition. This is a sign that people were experiencing increased freedom and more relaxed restrictions on their actions and speech. 2. Better Freedom in the World ratings: The 2012 Freedom in the World report upgraded Myanmar's rating from 7 (its lowest rating) to a 6 due to improvements in civil liberties and political rights. In 2013, Myanmar's rating further improved, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and a 6 in political freedoms. 3. Release of political prisoners: The release of political prisoners is a significant sign of increased freedom in speech and behavior. It shows that the government was more lenient towards individuals expressing their political beliefs and allowed for greater diversity of opinions. 4. Loosening of restrictions: After the transition, Myanmar saw a loosening of restrictions on various aspects of daily life. This can include reduced censorship on media, greater internet accessibility, and increased freedom to form and join organizations. 5. Growth of independent media: The emergence and growth of independent media outlets, including newspapers and broadcasters, indicate that people were able to access a wider range of information and express their views more freely without fear of persecution or censorship. 6. Greater political participation: After the transition, there was an increase in political participation, with more political parties being formed and more candidates running for office. This development suggests that people were taking advantage of their newfound freedom to engage in the political process. 7. Increased civil society engagement: As restrictions loosened, civil society organizations were able to participate more actively in public life. This enabled individuals to become more active in advocating for rights, voicing opinions, and participating in social and political debates. In summary, the improvement in Myanmar's human rights record, better Freedom in the World ratings, release of political prisoners, loosening of restrictions, growth of independent media, greater political participation, and increased civil society engagement all demonstrate that people in Myanmar were able to speak and behave more freely after the transition in 2011."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He creates two characters, with the first one being Sharkboy who was raised by sharks and his dad. The second character is Lavagirl who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them alight. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In real life, Max's parents have little time for him, and he is bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, Mr. Electricidad's (whose name is Spanish for \\"electricity\\") daughter. Linus steals Max's Dream Journal, where all of his ideas are kept, and vandalizes it. The next day, a tornado rages outside the school, and moments later Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear and ask Max to come with them to Planet Drool. They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Mr. Electric (also portrayed by George Lopez), originally the guardian of the dreamworld but now corrupted.Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster; then, with Max, confront Mr. Electric, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor (voiced by George Lopez), a robot toy that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet. Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \\"plughounds\\" across the planet.

NSA intelligence-gathering programs keep us safe I don’t mean to diminish the role of other intelligence agencies, and I say this as a 30-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency who is “CIA” through and through. But in most cases, the NSA is the starting point for determining what holes need to be filled through other means of intelligence-collection. That’s because its information on foreign developments is so comprehensive and generally so reliable. It is the core of intelligence support to U.S. troops in battle. Any efforts to “rein in” the agency must allow for the possibility that change risks serious damage to U.S. security and the country’s ability to navigate in an increasingly uncertain world. The presumption that the NSA “spies” on Americans should also be challenged. In my experience, NSA analysts err on the side of caution before touching any data having to do with U.S. citizens. In 2010, at the request of then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair, I chaired a panel investigating the intelligence community’s failure to be aware of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the “underwear bomber” who tried to blow up a commercial plane over Detroit on Dec. 25, 2009. The overall report remains classified, but I can say that the government lost vital time because of the extraordinary care the NSA and others took in handling any data involving a “U.S. person.” (Abdulmutallab, a Ni­ger­ian, was recruited and trained by the late Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen based in Yemen.) Regarding outrage over the NSA’s collection of telephone calling records, or metadata, I don’t know why anyone would have greater confidence in this information being held by private companies. And given the perceived threat to privacy, it’s astonishing how little attention has been paid to the Senate commerce committee’s recent report on companies that gather personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans and sell it to marketers, often highlighting people with financial vulnerability. Some companies group the data into categories including “rural and barely making it,” “retiring on empty” and “credit crunched: city families.” The aim is often to sell financially risky products to transient consumers with low incomes, the report found. That’s a real scandal — and a universe away from the NSA’s ethical standards and congressional oversight. The NSA, of course, is not perfect. But it is less a victim of its actions — the independent commission appointed by President Obama found no illegality or abuses — than of the broad distrust of government that has taken root in the United States in recent decades. Studies by Pew and others show distrust of government around 80 percent, an all-time high. This distrust is the only logical explanation I see for fear of data being held by “the government” — and it’s not a circumstance the NSA created. Although our society lauds, in almost “Stepford Wives”-like fashion, the merits of “transparency,” it lacks a collective, mature understanding of how intelligence works, how it integrates with foreign policy and how it contributes to the national welfare. Meanwhile, prurient interest in the details of leaked intelligence skyrockets, and people devour material that is not evidence of abuse but merely fascinating — and even more fascinating to U.S. adversaries. So what makes sense going forward? Clearly, the widespread perception that there is at least the “potential for abuse” when the government holds information even as limited as telephone call metadata must be addressed. The recent presidential commission recommended adding a public privacy advocate to the deliberation process of courts that approve warrants — one proposal that would do no harm. But as the administration contemplates reform, it must reject any ideas that add time and process between the moment the NSA picks up a lead overseas and the time it can cross-check records to determine whether there is a domestic dimension to overseas plotting. As our debate continues, the terrorist threat is not receding but transforming. The core leadership of al-Qaeda has been degraded and remains under pressure, but robust al-Qaeda affiliates have multiplied. With the decline of central government authority in the Middle East and North Africa in the wake of the Arab Spring and the war in Syria, terrorists have the largest havens and areas for operational planning in a decade. If anything, the atomization of the movement has made the job of intelligence more labor-intensive, more detail-oriented and more demanding. Now is not the time to give up any tool in the counterterrorism arsenal. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The crucial role of the NSA in providing comprehensive and reliable intelligence to support U.S. troops and national security, and the acknowledgement that efforts to \\"rein in\\" the agency should consider potential harm to U.S. security and the ability to navigate in an uncertain world. 2. The challenge to the presumption that the NSA \\"spies\\" on Americans, highlighting the cautious approach NSA analysts take in handling any data involving U.S. citizens. 3. The comparison of NSA's metadata collection to the private companies' data-gathering practices, which often exploit vulnerable Americans for financial gain, and questioning the relative outrage directed at the NSA. 4. The text asserts that the NSA is less a victim of its actions than of the broad distrust of government present in the U.S., and the lack of a collective understanding of how intelligence works and contributes to national welfare. 5. The recommendation of adding a public privacy advocate to the courts' deliberation process and the need to address the widespread perception of potential abuse while avoiding any measures that slow down the process of cross-checking leads. 6. The evolving and increasingly decentralized nature of the terrorist threat, which increases the challenges and demands on intelligence agencies like the NSA, making it important to maintain all available counterterrorism tools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Two people in scuba gear stand on the ledge of a platform while two other people watch from a platform above. The two people in scuba gear jump in the water. one person in scuba gear OPTIONS: (i). does a belly flop several times before jumping into the water gathered together.. (ii). wraps their face up.. (iii). holds on to the other person in scuba gear and does something to her tank.. (iv). balances on a balance beam hanging above the water with her hands extended..","completion":"The most logical next event in this scenario would be (iii). The person in scuba gear holds on to the other person in scuba gear and does something to her tank. This option seems the most logical because it directly involves an interaction between the two individuals in scuba gear and takes their context into consideration. Additionally, this interaction is related to a key element of scuba diving: the oxygen tank. Manipulating or adjusting a fellow diver's tank is a common practice in scuba diving, as this activity involves teamwork and mutual trust. Ensuring that fellow divers have their gear properly set up is essential for a safe and enjoyable diving experience, and the act of checking or adjusting a dive buddy's oxygen tank is both practical and reasonable in this context. Option (i) introduces an improbable humorous action (the belly flop), which is irrelevant to the context of scuba diving. It appears less logical compared to an interaction that directly pertains to diving safety and coordination. Option (ii) fails to provide clear information about the action being performed. Furthermore, in scuba diving, the divers already wear a mask covering their eyes and nose; hence, wrapping one's face is unnecessary and counterproductive to the activity. Option (iv) introduces an unrelated element (the balance beam) that is also implausible in the context of scuba diving. Balance beams are typically associated with gymnastics and are not designed for aquatic environments. This option does not add any benefit to the divers nor enhances their diving experience. In conclusion, option (iii) is the most logical next event because it is coherent with the given context and serves a purpose relevant to scuba diving. It reflects the cooperative nature of the activity and demonstrates an essential step in ensuring that the divers are well-prepared and safe underwater."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This means that your surroundings will appear more organized and less cluttered, giving you a more pleasant and comfortable living environment. Although you may not complete a thorough cleaning in a short amount of time, any effort you make will contribute to a more orderly and harmonious living space. The other options listed are less likely or not directly related to cleaning the house for a short time: A. Exhaustion: While cleaning can certainly be a physically demanding task, it is less likely for you to become exhausted from a brief cleaning session. Exhaustion usually occurs when you engage in strenuous or prolonged activities, whereas a short cleaning period cannot typically cause significant fatigue. B. Tiredness: Similar to exhaustion, tiredness is also a potential outcome of cleaning. However, if you are only cleaning for a short time, it is less probable that this activity will cause you to feel overly tired or fatigued. A more intense or longer cleaning session might more likely lead to tiredness. C. Sneezing: Sneezing is a possibility when cleaning, especially if you are exposed to dust or allergens. However, this outcome largely depends on your environment and individual sensitivities. Thus, it is not a guaranteed result when cleaning for a short amount of time. E. Make money: Cleaning your own house does not typically result in making money. This option would be more applicable if you were a professional house cleaner being paid for your services. In the context of cleaning your personal living space for a short period, making money is not a direct outcome of the activity. In conclusion, among the given options, the most suitable answer is creating order. A brief cleaning session can lead to a more orderly and organized living space, which positively impacts your overall well-being and mental state.

On a rainy day in New England, both teams' defenses held firm early, with the teams trading punts until New England went on a drive that reached one play into the second quarter, when Stephen Gostkowski booted a 31-yard field goal. On the Jets' next play from scrimmage, Chad Pennington was intercepted by Artrell Hawkins. Two plays later, Tom Brady found Doug Gabriel open downfield for a long first down, but Victor Hobson forced a fumble and Kerry Rhodes recovered. The Jets followed with a time-consuming 16-play, 9:12 drive, capped off by a two-yard Kevan Barlow touchdown run for a 7-3 Jets lead. New England battled downfield, converting a 4th-and-1 from their own 44 with a run to fullback Heath Evans, and on the first play after the two-minute warning, Brady appeared to be intercepted by Drew Coleman, who ran the ball back 35 yards. But, the play was negated on a controversial roughing-the-passer call on Hobson, who dove at Brady as he was releasing the ball, but drove him into the ground, prompting the flag. The Patriots then converted on a 4th-and-3 from the Jets' 24, but settled for a 21-yard field goal from Gostkowski with four seconds left. Justin Miller ran back the opening kickoff of the second half 62 yards, and the drive ended with Pennington lining up in the shotgun on 4th-and-5 from the Patriots' 33, only to punt the ball to the New England 4. After a Patriots punt, Pennington led the Jets on another long drive, this one 15 plays and only 45 yards, but it ate 6:40 off the clock and resulted in Nugent's 34-yard field goal. Midway through the fourth quarter, Brady was intercepted by Erik Coleman, and Pennington tossed a 22-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery, barely keeping his feet inbounds, although the play was never challenged. The Jets led 17-6 with 4:51 to go. However, operating out of a no-huddle offense, Brady led the Patriots 61 yards in 31 seconds, capped by a 15-yard touchdown pass to Reche Caldwell, and Brady found Caldwell again on the two-point conversion to narrow the lead to 17-14. But the next drive was critical, as the Jets forced New England to use all three timeouts, punting with 1:15 to go. New England took over at their own 11-yard line and moved the ball to the Jets' 46-yard line. On the final play of the game, Brady was sacked by Shaun Ellis.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"A hurricane usually starts as an organized thunderstorm activity that stretches at least 100 miles across and maintains its identity for more than 24 hours. This initial stage is critical for the formation of a tropical cyclone, as it provides the necessary energy and moisture for the system to develop further. Warm ocean waters, typically above 80°F (27°C), and a suitable atmospheric environment, with low vertical wind shear, are the key ingredients for the development of these storms. Under the right conditions, the organized thunderstorm activity can develop further and start to spin around a low-pressure center. This rotation, which is caused by the Coriolis effect, is vital for the cyclone's organization and intensification. At this stage, the system is classified as a \\"tropical cyclone\\" or \\"tropical depression,\\" depending on its wind speeds and structure. If the system strengthens and wind speeds rise past 39 mph (63 km/h), the cyclone is dubbed a \\"tropical storm.\\" Tropical storms are given names to facilitate communication and warnings, as they can pose significant threats to life and property. The central pressure in the storm continues to drop, and the system organizes further, with a more pronounced rotation. Should the pressure in the center drops even further and the winds really pick up, the storm may eventually form a clearly defined \\"eye.\\" At this point, with wind speeds reaching at least 74 mph (119 km/h), the tropical storm becomes a hurricane. The hurricane's intensity can be ranked on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which ranges from category 1 (weakest) to category 5 (most powerful). Now, regarding the supposition that hunting happens during the hurricane formation process, it should be determined whether it would affect less powerful hurricanes directly, indirectly, or not impact any step of the process. The supposed perturbation in this context would most likely be indirectly impacting a step of the process. This is because hunting activities do not have a direct impact on hurricane formation or intensification. However, the indirect impacts could stem from the potential changes in the ecological systems and landscape that result from hunting. These changes may alter factors such as vegetation, which can influence evapotranspiration rates, soil moisture levels, and ultimately, the local climate. Changes in the local climate, on a large scale, could potentially influence atmospheric conditions that are necessary for the formation and intensification of hurricanes. It's important to note, however, that this indirect impact would likely be very minimal given the multitude of factors involved in hurricane formation. Hunting may play a negligible role in the overall process, and other natural and anthropogenic factors, such as global climate change, will likely have a more significant impact on hurricane formation, intensity, and frequency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to create a strong burning charcoal fire without lighter fluid Know that inexpensive chimney starters are the easiest way to get a strong fire every time. Usually sold for under 30, chimney starters use newspaper and heat convection to evenly light up your charcoal briquets. You can then safely dump them into your grill and get cooking within 15-20 minutes. Choose your answer from: I. The most common camping stoves will consist mostly of smoker starters. You also may be able to fit a long-lasting chimney starter.; II. With cheap charcoal starters : Charcoal briquets: open cans grill carefully at level with burners set up for about 10 minutes. Place inside the grill with a pan at the bottom.; III. Old fashioned charcoal starters that use paper, or wool, give you three-to-four flare-ups: lit-up charcoal will give a moderate build-up. Any more fuel and sparks will let in too much fire.; IV. Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper. Between 2 and 4 pieces of paper, depending on the size of the starter, should do.; Answer:","completion":"IV. Load the bottom of the chimney starter with lightly balled newspaper. Between 2 and 4 pieces of paper, depending on the size of the starter, should do. Using a chimney starter without lighter fluid is not only environmentally friendly, but it also helps avoid any unwanted chemical taste in your grilled food. To create a strong burning charcoal fire using a chimney starter, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose the appropriate fuel: Select high-quality charcoal briquets or hardwood lump charcoal for better heat and flavor. Hardwood lump charcoal tends to burn hotter and purer, while briquets offer a more consistent and longer-lasting burn. 2. Prepare the chimney starter: Place the chimney starter on a stable, heat-proof surface near your grill. Ensure that the handle is cool to touch and that it's in the locked position before proceeding. 3. Load the newspaper: Crumple 2 to 4 pieces of newspaper, depending on the size of your chimney starter, and place them at the bottom of the chimney. Make sure they are loosely balled, allowing for proper airflow. 4. Fill the chimney starter: Pour charcoal briquets or hardwood lump charcoal into the top of the chimney until it is full, ensuring that the briquets or lumps are evenly distributed. 5. Ignite the newspaper: Use a long match or lighter to ignite the newspaper through the holes at the bottom of the chimney starter. The flames will rise through the chimney, igniting the charcoal above. 6. Ensure proper airflow: To achieve a strong burning fire, it is essential to allow sufficient airflow through the chimney starter. Avoid blocking the vent holes at the bottom and top of the chimney. Proper ventilation will enable faster ignition and even heating of the charcoal. 7. Wait for the charcoal to heat: Once the newspaper is lit and the fire catches, allow the charcoal to heat up for about 15-20 minutes. When the charcoal becomes white and ashy on the surface, it's ready for use. 8. Safely dump the coals into the grill: Using heat-resistant gloves, securely grasp the handle of the chimney starter and slowly pour the hot charcoal into your grill. Distribute the coals as needed, creating either a direct or indirect heat source for your cooking. 9. Grill your food: Place the cooking grate over the hot coals and allow it to heat up for a few minutes. Then, place your food on the grate and enjoy grilling without the use of lighter fluid. By following these steps, you will have yourself a strong, clean-burning, and flavorful charcoal fire that rivals even the most experienced grill masters.

Yes The premise does entail the hypothesis. In the given premise, it is stated that the Sinn Féin members, instead of going to London, decided to establish Dáil Éireann in Dublin, which in turn sparked the War of Independence. The act of setting up Dáil Éireann by the Sinn Féin members directly contributed to the initiation of the conflict, thereby making them responsible for sparking the War of Independence. To understand this further, it is important to delve into the historical context and explore the events leading up to the establishment of Dáil Éireann and the subsequent War of Independence. The 1918 general election in Ireland was a turning point in the country's political landscape. The previous dominance of the Irish Parliamentary Party, which sought Home Rule within the United Kingdom, was challenged by the rise of a more radical and nationalist party - Sinn Féin. This party aimed to achieve complete independence from Britain and establish an Irish Republic. Sinn Féin emerged victorious in the 1918 election, capturing 73 out of 105 seats, mostly at the expense of the moderate Irish Parliamentary Party. However, instead of taking their seats in the British Parliament in London as expected, Sinn Féin refused to do so. They rejected the idea of being part of the British system and desired to create their own republican government. On the 21st of January 1919, the elected members of Sinn Féin established Dáil Éireann (Assembly of Ireland) in Dublin as an independent Irish parliament. This act of defiance and declaration of independence was a direct challenge to British rule in Ireland. It marked a shift from the pursuit of Home Rule within the United Kingdom to a complete break from British governance, which eventually led to the War of Independence. The War of Independence, also known as the Anglo-Irish War, took place between 1919 and 1921. It was a guerrilla war waged by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) against the British government and its forces in Ireland. The war was characterized by violence, assassinations, and attacks on police barracks, government buildings, and other symbols of British authority. The conflict ultimately led to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on December 6, 1921, which established the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Commonwealth. However, the treaty also sparked the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) between those who supported the agreement and those who opposed it due to the partition of Ireland and allegiance to the British Crown. In conclusion, the premise entails the hypothesis as it is explicitly mentioned that the Sinn Féin members' actions in establishing Dáil Éireann in Dublin sparked the War of Independence. This act was a direct challenge to British authority in Ireland and marked the beginning of the violent and tumultuous path towards Irish independence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information: - Pan Am Flight 103 was a regularly scheduled Pan Am transatlantic flight from Frankfurt to Detroit via London and New York. On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route, was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew, in what became known as the Lockerbie bombing. Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto residential areas of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 11 more people on the ground. Following a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. In 1999, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi handed over the two men for trial at Camp Zeist, Netherlands after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. In 2001, Libyan intelligence officer Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was released by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died in May 2012, the only person to be convicted for the attack. He had continually asserted his innocence. - Lockerbie is a town in Dumfries and Galloway, south-western Scotland. It lies approximately from Glasgow, and from the English border.

The village grew up on the south bank of an important crossing of the River Earn, whose sandstone bridge existed from at least the early 14th century, when it is known to have been repaired by order of King Robert I of Scotland (13061329) (site: NO 133 185). Substantial remains of the medieval bridge (rendered redundant by a replacement, still in use, slightly upstream in 1821-22) survived into the 1970s, when almost all the stonework was demolished, for (allegedly) being in a dangerously ruinous condition. This ancient bridge was a major landmark on the road between Edinburgh (39 miles south) and Perth (4 miles north) for several centuries. The village's oldest houses are to be found lining the road (Back Street/Old Edinburgh Road) leading south from the site of the demolished bridge.

Question: What is Dr. Sorensen dying of? Title: Crack in the World Movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: People usually hate mice, but one mouse has won the hearts of the people all over the world---the famous Mickey Mouse. Fifty years ago most movies were silent. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse that could talk his movies. He named his mouse Mickey Mouse. People, both young and old, were very excited at the talking mouse. Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto. This dog does stupid things and makes mistakes wherever he goes. Now our Mickey Mouse is not only clean but also important. He appears as a beautiful and clever star. He has his friends in almost every country. Question: Mickey Mouse has his friends _ today.

Sentence 1 - \\"NATO: Patriot missile battery operational on Syrian border\\" Sentence 2 - \\"Obama: Patriot missile batteries, troops to stay in Jordan near Syrian border\\" There are a few reasons why I have picked option IV (similarity level 3): 1. Both sentences deal with the same subject: Patriot missile batteries, a defensive missile system. 2. The location of interest for these sentences is the border of Syria. However, the first sentence specifically notes that the Patriot missile battery is positioned at the border, while the second sentence states that the missile batteries and troops are located in Jordan, a neighboring country that shares a border with Syria. This distinction reduces the level of similarity between the sentences. 3. The two sentences are indirectly connected through different parties: NATO (an international military alliance) and Obama (referring to the U.S. government under President Barack Obama). NATO would be involved in decisions about the broader strategy, while the U.S., as a member of the alliance, would have a prominent role in decisions about their own military deployment.

This curious phenomenon can be attributed to the careful and thoughtful combination of ingredients that were chosen to enhance and harmonize with the natural taste profile of blueberries in the tart, as opposed to the pie. When it comes to crafting mouthwatering and memorable desserts, flavor pairing plays an essential role in determining whether the final result is a hit or miss. In the case of the ill-fated blueberry pie, it appears that the other ingredients chosen to accompany the blueberries failed to form a pleasing palate experience. This may have been due to clashing textures, overpowering secondary flavors, or simply a poor choice of complementary elements that did not do justice to the sweet and slightly tart notes of blueberries. Conversely, the blueberry tart was a shining example of flavor pairing done right. Perhaps the tart began with a buttery and flaky crust that allowed the blueberry filling to be the star of the show. The tart's filling might have included an optimal balance of sweetness and tartness, carefully calibrated to accentuate the fresh blueberries' taste without overwhelming them. Furthermore, the successful tart could have employed different complementary flavors to achieve its winning taste. One possibility would be the addition of zesty citrus notes, such as lemon or orange, which can brighten and enhance the blueberries' natural sweetness. Another option might have incorporated subtle hints of warm spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla, which can add depth and complexity to the blueberry filling, resulting in a comforting and well-rounded dessert. In both the pie and tart, the use of blueberries signals an appreciation for their unique and delightful taste. However, it is only in the tart that the blueberries were allowed to shine to their full potential, thanks to the skillful handling of complementary flavors. A masterful dessert combines various components in such a way that each ingredient elevates the others, producing a harmonious and satisfying sensory experience for the consumer. In conclusion, the blueberries' perceived deliciousness in the tart versus their unappealing presence in the pie can be explained by the tart's successful integration of complementary flavors that highlighted and celebrated the blueberries' intrinsic qualities. The tart showcased the importance of understanding flavor pairing and the thoughtful consideration of accompanying ingredients to ensure each component works together to create a masterpiece of taste, texture, and satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

Article:Save the Children says a quarter of boys in England - 90,000 - started reception class struggling to speak a full sentence or follow instructions. The report, based on a University of Bristol study, says children who start school behind often never catch up. A Department for Education spokesperson said \\"we are making a significant investment in the early years sector\\". The report compared girls' and boys' scores in the early language and communication goals of the Early Years Foundation Stage assessment. This assessment is taken at the end of Reception by all pupils in England. Children are expected to be able to listen and express themselves effectively, showing awareness of listeners' needs. They should be able to listen to simple instructions and answer \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" questions. Overall last year, 25% of boys were unable to meet these requirements, compared with 14% of girls. But for those on free school meals, the difference was more stark, with 38% of boys not meeting the standard compared with 23% of girls. The report found that there was no area in England where boys were outperforming girls in early language skills, on average. The gap between boys' and girls' EYFS scores was widest in St Helen's, Merseyside, where 31% of boys did not reach the expected level compared with 14% of girls. The narrowest gap was in Richmond upon Thames at 5%. Here, 11% of boys did not meet the standard compared with 6% of girls. The report said it was not clear whether this early gender gap was the result of biological differences and rate of development, or social processes. But it quotes earlier research suggesting girls are more likely to be able to develop the behaviour and attributes, such as persistence, independence and flexible thinking, that enable them to learn. It also highlights how girls outperform boys at every level of education. The report concludes: \\"We cannot wait for disadvantaged children and boys to get to school before they receive the support they need. \\"By this time many will have already fallen behind, with negative consequences for their childhoods, school attainment and life chances. \\"We must invest in the best early years provision, led by early years teachers and supported by skilled staff at all levels, particularly in the most deprived areas.\\" The director of poverty at Save the Children, Gareth Jenkins, said: \\"In England, too many children, especially boys, are slipping under the radar without the support they need to reach their potential. \\"They're falling behind before they even get to school and that puts their life chances at risk. \\"In 2016 this is unacceptable. A whole generation of boys is being failed.\\" Responding to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Education said \\"the number of qualified staff is rising with more trained graduates in the workforce and a record number of providers rated Good or Outstanding. \\"This investment is paying off, latest figures show more than 80 per cent of children are reaching the expected communication and language skills by age five, but we will continue working with the sector until every child gets the high-quality education they deserve.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"This story is about a report that says a lot of boys in England - about 90,000 of them - are having trouble when they start school. They struggle to talk in full sentences and to follow simple instructions. A place called Save the Children found this out by looking at a study from a university. The report says that when children begin school and they're already having trouble, they often don't catch up. The people who make the rules for schools said they know about the problems and they're spending a lot of money to make things better. The people who wrote the report looked at scores from a test that all children in England take at the end of a school year. The test looks at how good children are at talking, expressing themselves and listening. When they looked at the scores, they found that 25% of boys didn't do very well, compared to 14% of girls. They also noticed that boys who get free lunch at school did even worse. The report found that girls do better than boys in all areas of England when it comes to early language skills. They're unsure whether it's because girls grow and learn at a different rate than boys or if it's because of some other reason. The people who wrote the report say that it's important to help kids as soon as possible. If we wait until they're in school, it may be too late and it might affect them negatively later in life. A man named Gareth Jenkins who works at Save the Children said that too many kids, particularly boys, are not getting the help they need and this can affect their future. In response, the Department for Education said that they have more qualified teachers and that they have better schools now.

German is a West Germanic language primarily spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and some parts of Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is the most widely spoken native language in the European Union. German belongs to the family of Germanic languages, which also includes English, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, among others. It uses the Latin script, which is composed of 26 basic letters. In addition to these, German writing also employs umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and the special character \\"ß\\" (Eszett or \\"sharp S\\"). The language has a rich grammar and extensive vocabulary, making it a complex yet fascinating language to learn. German is an inflected language, meaning that words change their form in order to indicate grammatical information such as gender, number, case, and tense. There are three genders in German (masculine, feminine, and neuter), four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative), and both singular and plural forms for nouns. Verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, and sometimes mood. An important characteristic of the German language is its extensive use of compound words. Instead of creating new words, Germans tend to combine existing ones to form compound words that might look long and intimidating to non-German speakers. However, this practice also allows for a very descriptive and precise vocabulary. The standard form of the German language – referred to as Hochdeutsch, or High German – evolved from the Middle German dialects during the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. Today, there are several regional dialects of German across the countries where it is spoken, which differ in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. In recent years, German has gained importance as a foreign language globally, second only to English among European languages. It has become a widely taught language in both Europe and North America, with millions of students learning German as a foreign language. As a result, knowledge of German can be beneficial for various purposes, such as business, academics, tourism, or simply engaging in cross-cultural communication."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 - February 9, 2001) was an American economist and political scientist whose primary interest was decision-making within organizations and is best known for the theories of \\"bounded rationality\\" and \\"satisficing\\". He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881-1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt. An inventor who was granted \\"several dozen patents\\", his father also was an independent patent attorney. His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne. His European ancestors had been piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds. Simon called himself an atheist. Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under John R. Commons. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited Richard Ely's economics textbook, Norman Angell's The Great Illusion, and Henry George's Progress and Poverty. At that time, Simon argued \\"from conviction, rather than cussedness\\" in favor of George's controversial \\"single tax\\" on land rents. In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his \\"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\\". He chose instead to focus on political science and economics. His most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist. Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science, from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicholas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam. After enrolling in a course on \\"Measuring Municipal Governments\\", Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored Measuring Municipal Activities in 1938. Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation.

Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments.

Background: The Veterans Committee was the popular name of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee to Consider Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players; a former voting committee of the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame that provided an opportunity for Hall of Fame enshrinement to all individuals who are eligible for induction but ineligible for consideration by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). The term \\"Veterans Committee\\" (was composed of four committees of baseball veterans) is taken from the body's former official name: National Baseball Hall of Fame Committee on Baseball Veterans (1953). In July 2010, the Veterans Committee name was changed by the Hall of Fame Board of Directors and its name was no longer officially used by the Hall of Fame, which called three new 16-member voting committees by era: the Expansion Era Committee (1973-present), the Golden Era Committee (1947-1972), and the Pre-Integration Era Committee (1876-1946) - each, \\"The Committee\\" (the term \\"Veterans Committee\\" is still being used by some sports media). The three committees met on a rotating cycle once every three years to elect candidates from each era to the Hall of Fame that have been \\"identified\\" by a BBWAA-appointed \\"Screening Committee\\" named the \\"Historical Overview Committee\\" (10-12 representatives; BBWAA members). Context: The Veterans Committee election process, radically changed in 2001, was revamped yet again in July 2007. The changes that most directly affected this election involved elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives). Under the 2001 rules, elections of non-players would be held every fourth year on a \\"composite ballot\\". No candidate was elected from the composite ballot in 2003 or 2007. With the 2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was split into two separate ballots--one for managers and umpires and the other for executives. Also, the voting membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members of the Hall, was now reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus additional executives and sportswriters (only one of whom had been among the previous electorate). Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots will now take place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, starting with 2008. To be eligible, managers and umpires need to be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives need to be either retired or at least age 65. A Historical Overview Committee of eleven sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of ten managers and umpires; the committee members were: Dave Van Dyck (Chicago Tribune), Bob Elliott (Toronto Sun), Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch), Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau), Moss Klein (Newark Star-Ledger), Bill Madden (New York Daily News), Ken Nigro (formerly Baltimore Sun), Jack O'Connell (MLB.com), Nick Peters (The Sacramento Bee), Tracy Ringolsby (Rocky Mountain News) and Mark Whicker (The Orange County Register). The managers/umpires list was submitted to a sixteen-member panel composed of ten Hall of Famers (eight players and two managers), three executives and three veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of ten executives was developed by a twelve-member panel including seven executives, two players and three writers, which was the same committee which did the final voting in that area. On November 8, 2007, the final ballots were released. Each panel member could vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel would be elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions was possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville, Tennessee on December 2, 2007, with the results announced on December 3; it was the first time since 2001 that the Committee met to discuss candidates, as the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.

The couple's 2015 breakup heavily influenced Radiohead's 'A Moon Shaped Pool' album. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke’s former partner, Rachel Owen, died Sunday (Dec. 18) at 48 following a battle with cancer. A celebrated scholar and artist, Owen was a retained lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. She continued to teach as her health declined during the past year. Owen was an expert in medieval Italian literature and a renowned artist and printmaker. One of her last works, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante’s first book of The Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery. While Owen and Yorke were together for 23 years, she lived a private life and was rarely seen in public with the singer. The couple had two children together -- a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, age 15 and 12. Their August 2015 separation heavily influenced Radiohead’s latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool. ||||| It is with great sadness that the College marks the death of Dr Rachel Owen, who was a Retained Lecturer in Italian here at Pembroke. Dr Owen was an internationally renowned artist – mixing photography and printmaking – and at the same time a scholar in medieval Italian literature. As Retained Lecturer, she used to teach Dante’s Divine Comedy to Pembroke’s finalists in Italian. Dr Owen’s parallel passion for art and literature was already established in her university years at Exeter, where she studied Italian and Fine Art. She then moved to Royal Holloway, London, where she completed a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. Each year, her Pembroke students enjoyed the pleasure and the privilege of a guided tour through the manuscripts of the Divine Comedy held at the Bodleian Library. Despite her declining health from cancer in the last year, she asked to continue to teach, which she did right until the end of last Michaelmas term. She was 48 years old and leaves behind a son, Noah, and a daughter, Agnes, aged 15 and 12. One of her latest artistic productions was a series of prints inspired by the Cantos of Dante’s first book of the Divine Comedy. The prints will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery during Trinity term.

She was 48 and had suffered from cancer. Owen and Yorke split last year after a 23-year-long relationship, and he announced the news in a statement. The pair have two children, Noah, who is 15, and Agnes, who is 12. This year, Yorke made reference to their split in Radiohead's most recent album, A Moon Shaped Pool. The pair met as art students at Exeter University. Owen was an artist and a printmaker but worked at Oxford University, where she was a Retained Lecturer in Italian at Pembroke College. Pembroke College announced her death in an obituary posted online on Monday. Owen had a PhD on the illustrations of the early manuscripts of Dante’s Divine Comedy. The work inspired one of her last artistic projects, a series of prints that will be exhibited at Pembroke’s JCR Art Gallery next Spring.

She was a respected scholar and artist, working as a retained lecturer in Italian at the University of Oxford's Pembroke College. Owen was an expert in medieval Italian literature and a renowned artist and printmaker. One of her last works, a series of prints inspired by the cantos of Dante's first book of The Divine Comedy, will be exhibited at Pembroke's JCR Art Gallery. Owen and Yorke were together for 23 years and had two children. Their separation in 2015 heavily influenced Radiohead's latest album, A Moon Shaped Pool."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the greatest cultural background factor affecting the film?","completion":"The greatest cultural background factor affecting the film \\"Departures\\" is the strong social taboo in Japanese culture against people who deal with death and the idea of defilement or \\"kegare\\" related to death. This causes prejudice and discrimination towards those working closely with the dead, such as morticians or nokanshi in the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". answer the following question: What was the last name of the person who used a powerful amplifier in Foo Fighters songs?

Here is one sentence: The exploring party went through the high gap in the mountains. Here is another sentence: There was a gap in his account. Does the term gap mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"No, the term \\"gap\\" does not mean the same thing in both sentences. The word \\"gap\\" has multiple meanings, and these two sentences illustrate two different uses of the term. In the first sentence, \\"The exploring party went through the high gap in the mountains,\\" the term \\"gap\\" refers to a physical space or opening between two objects or geographic features. In this context, a gap is a passage or a break in a continuous structure, such as a mountain range or hills. It is often used to describe a natural break in the landscape that allows for easier navigation or travel through what might otherwise be a difficult or impassable terrain. Here, the exploring party utilizes this gap to traverse the mountain range. In the second sentence, \\"There was a gap in his account,\\" the term \\"gap\\" carries a different meaning. Here, it means a missing piece of information, an inconsistency, or a discrepancy in someone's explanation or narration of events. This use of the term \\"gap\\" pertains to the intangible or conceptual, not the physical. In this context, the sentence implies that there is a part of the narrative that does not add up, leaving questions or doubts about the accuracy or completeness of the individual's account. In conclusion, while the word \\"gap\\" in both sentences indicates a type of separation or opening, the nature and context of the separation differ significantly.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the babies have to go to the NICU? Options: - because the labor was too long - not enough information - because they were in a small town - because they were born 2 months early The answer is:","completion":"because they were born 2 months early"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solutions for male menopause Andropause /an•dro•pause/ (an´dro-pawz) a variable complex of symptoms, including decreased Leydig cell numbers and androgen production, occurring in men after middle age, purported to be analogous to menopause in women.* Experts say 52 percent of men age 40 to 70 have erectile problems – that’s about 30 million men in the United States. Is the answer a prescription like Viagra, or could it be andropause? Andropause is referred to as the male menopause, or colloquially as “manopause.” Each of these terms is used to describe the gradual decline of testosterone experienced by many men as they age. Testosterone levels typically peak in a man’s mid-to-late 20s and gradually decline with each passing year. As testosterone production declines, levels of other hormones, such as estrogen, begin to increase. These incessant fluctuations in hormone levels make it increasingly difficult for remaining testosterone to function effectively. The resulting deficiency of testosterone brings on many of the same symptoms that women experience during menopause: hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain, irritability, diminished sex drive, fatigue, hair loss, insomnia and decreased muscle mass. The key difference between menopause and andropause is that with andropause, hormone imbalances evolve gradually over time causing symptoms to go unnoticed or are dismissed as a normal part of the aging process. Testosterone assists the male body in building protein and is crucial for normal sex drive, stamina and the ability to achieve erection. Testosterone also contributes to several metabolic functions including bone formation, liver function, prostate gland growth and production of blood cells in bone marrow. While testosterone is declining in men, the sex binding hormone globulin (SHBG), also called androgen-binding protein, increases in levels. SHGB inhibits a substantial portion of remaining testosterone from working - the remaining working testosterone is referred to as bio-available testosterone or “free T.” Bio-available testosterone declines with time, causing the development of symptoms classically associated andropause. The risks and benefits of testosterone replacement may be evaluated by a qualified hormone therapy expert. Androgen replacement therapy is not a one size fits all treatment - testosterone replacement therapy is a treatment for men with low testosterone who want to boost their health and overall well-being. Through hormone therapy and a regimented treatment plan, the aches and pains of andropause may be minimized or eliminated – without the risk – testosterone therapy is not linked to prostate cancer and has been shown to improve cholesterol levels and decreases the risk of heart disease. *Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. © 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.

What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Andropause, also known as male menopause or \\"manopause,\\" is a gradual decline of testosterone levels in men as they age, which can cause symptoms similar to those experienced by women during menopause. These symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, weight gain, irritability, reduced sex drive, fatigue, hair loss, insomnia, and decreased muscle mass. The decline in testosterone also affects protein building, sex drive, stamina, and metabolic functions. As bio-available testosterone declines over time, symptoms associated with andropause can develop. Hormone therapy and a personalized treatment plan can help minimize or eliminate the discomforts of andropause, without increasing the risk of prostate cancer or heart disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: Who finally stops the blob? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Beware! The Blob Context: Left off after the events of the first movie The Blob, an oil pipeline layer named Chester (Godfrey Cambridge) returns to his suburban Los Angeles home from the North Pole, bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the blob to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife (Marlene Clark) accidentally let it thaw, releasing \\"the Blob\\". It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, Chester's wife, and then Chester himself (while he is watching a television broadcast of the film The Blob). Lisa (Gwynne Gilford), a friend, walks in to see Chester being devoured by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby (Robert Walker, Jr.). Meanwhile, the rapidly growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies (Cindy Williams and Randy Stonehill) in a storm drain, a barber (Shelley Berman) and his client, transients (played by director Hagman, Burgess Meredith and Del Close), a Scoutmaster (Dick Van Patten), a farm full of chickens, and a bar full of people. At one point, Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In the panic, the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats because of its vulnerability to cold. The now-massive blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink (consuming dozens more people in the process). It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelopes his feet as he is speaking on camera.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Although I didn't have any interest in being a school bus driver, I became one. Many years later, I was still working on the school bus. There are so many good reasons. Firstly, the talk brought me different kinds of information. I also got to hear all the family secrets of the newcomers. I have a toy bear who was a great comforter for the little ones. The kids got to look after him on the trip to school and he waited patiently for _ to get on for the trip home. Our bus would often pass a place where we could see some alpacas in front of a farm house. Little Michael would cry excitedly from the seat, \\"Look, Miss! Look at the camels!\\" He used to put his head out of the bus window. When I warned him that a little insect would come into his nose if he wasn't careful, he smartly gave up the habit. I remember a little girl got on the bus one morning 5 years ago and sobbed all the way to school. We arrived at the school gate. As she waited to get down the bus, she threw her arms around my neck and cried that her grandfather had died the night before. A school bus driver needs to keep one eye on the road and the other on the mirror to watch what the little ones are doing down the back.

Mary drops out of college (with 6 months to go) to marry Fred. Their perfect wedding mirrors the happy endings of the films Mary loves. 1969: It is the Wilsons' 16th wedding anniversary. On his way to work, Fred, a successful tax consultant, tells their maid Agnes that he has found vodka hidden in Mary's wardrobe and asks Agnes to keep an eye on his wife. Mary sets out for the beauty parlour. At an airline office, however, Mary buys a one-way ticket to Nassau, Bahamas looking for an escape from her dull and unhappy suburban life. On the flight she recalls the horrors of last year's anniversary party, when Fred had drunkenly flirted with a blond divorcee, and she had taken refuge in the bottle and a rerun of Casablanca. At a stop-over, she calls home and learns this year's anniversary party has been a different sort of disaster. Her teenage daughter Marge is scared by Mary's call, as it reminds her of the time she had found her mother unconscious after an overdose. En route to Nassau, Mary meets Flo, an old college friend she has not seen since 1953. While Mary settled down to married life, Flo has been the mistress of a series of married men and lives a rather carefree and hedonistic lifestyle and has fully embraced the sexual revolution.

They contain contrasting information about the bassist Duane Cowan's relocation. Let's examine the key differences between the two statements. Sentence 1: \\"The band then added bassist Duane Cowan, who had recently relocated from Japan to Los Angeles.\\" Here, the sentence suggests that Duane Cowan moved from Japan to Los Angeles and then joined the band. This indicates that his relocation to Los Angeles preceded his addition to the group. Additionally, the direction of the move is from Japan to Los Angeles. Sentence 2: \\"The band then added bassist Duane Cowan, who moved from Los Angeles to Japan recently.\\" In this case, the sentence implies that Duane Cowan joined the band and then relocated from Los Angeles to Japan.

Write an article based on this summary: – The Philippines is making headlines on two fronts: First, somebody leaked a transcript of President Trump's phone call to Filipino counterpart Rodrigo Duterte last month. Second, Duterte, already renowned for his brutal crackdown on drugs, is considering imposing martial law nationwide as his troops battle militants linked to ISIS. The details: Praise on drugs: “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,\\" Trump told him. \\"Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that.” Duterte has been criticized by human rights groups for essentially declaring open season on drug dealers and users. Troops and vigilantes have killed an estimated 6,000 drug dealers since July, per the State Department, notes the Washington Post. Swipe at Obama? Duterte called drugs the \\"scourge of my nation,\\" and Trump said he understood, adding, \\"I think we had a previous president who did not understand that.\\" North Korea: “We can’t let a madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that. We have a lot of firepower, more than he has, times 20—but we don’t want to use it,\\" Trump said. He asked Duterte if he thought Kim were \\"stable or not stable,\\" and Duterte said unstable, adding that China is the \\"ace\\" card to be played. \\"It's only China.\\" Not-so-secret submarines: Trump told Duterte the US had \\"a lot of firepower over there,\\" referring to the Korean peninsula, and he specifically mentioned two nuclear submarines, \\"the best in the world.\\" The revelation is likely to raise more questions about Trump's handling of sensitive information, notes Reuters. Transcript: Here is the transcript of the phone call, from the Intercept. Trump's style: The New York Times says it sheds light on how he deals with fellow leaders: \\"He sounds much the way he sounds in public, casing issues in largely black-and-white terms, often praising authoritarian leaders, largely unconcerned about human rights violations and genuinely uncertain about the nature of his adversary in North Korea.\\" Hostages: Duterte has declared martial law in the southern island of Mindanao after militants affiliated with ISIS raided the city of Marawi. The militants took a Catholic priest and 13 others hostage, and thousands of civilians were fleeing the violence. The CBC has details. Mindanao also happens to be Duterte's native island in the archipelago. Nationwide? Duterte hinted he might expand martial law nationwide after suggesting ISIS also was showing strength in the northern island of Luzon, reports Bloomberg. Ominous quote: \\"If I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there's an open defiance you will die and if it means many people dying, so be it. That's how it is,\\" said Duterte, per Reuters.","completion":"The Philippines is currently in the international spotlight due to two recent developments. Firstly, reports emerged detailing a conversation between US President Donald Trump and Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte last month. Secondly, Duterte, who is already well known for his harsh crackdown on drugs, is considering extending martial law across the entire country as his forces fight against militants connected to ISIS. During the now-public telephone call, Trump congratulated Duterte on his approach to the Philippines’ drug problem, stating that he had done an “unbelievable job”. Duterte has previously been criticized by human rights campaigners for enabling the killing of drug dealers and users. Since he assumed power last July, Filipino troops and vigilantes have executed an estimated 6,000 drug dealers, according to the US State Department and the Washington Post. The conversation between Trump and Duterte also touched on former President Obama, who Duterte labeled as the “scourge” of his nation. Trump sympathized, claiming that Obama failed to “understand” the situation in the Philippines. The two leaders continued their conversation by discussing North Korea. Trump stated that the US could not risk the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, who he described as a “madman with nuclear weapons let on the loose like that”. Although Trump was keen to mention the significant firepower possessed by the US, he also stressed that he was not hoping to use it. In turn, Duterte classified Kim as “unstable”, suggesting that China holds the key in the developing situation. A fascinating aspect of Trump’s discussion with Duterte related to US submarines. Trump stated that the US had “a lot of firepower over there” referring to the Korean Peninsula. He specifically cited two nuclear submarines, which he claimed were \\"the best in the world\\". The involvement of nuclear submarines is likely to provoke further questions regarding Trump's handling of classified information. The leaked transcript of the telephone call provides some insight into Trump’s interactions with other leaders. It seems that his characteristic blunt style is ever present, both in public and private situations. Furthermore, he frequently offers praise to authoritarian rulers, often seeming unconcerned about the potential human rights abuses that could be tied to such regimes. In the meantime, numerous hostages have been taken in the southern island of Mindanao by ISIS-affiliated militants, prompting Duterte to declare martial law. Thousands of citizens have been displaced as a result of the ongoing violence. Furthermore, Duterte himself has hinted that he might extend martial law across the entire country, as he feels that ISIS is making its presence known on the northern island of Luzon. Duterte’s uncompromising approach to the situation has been clearly demonstrated in recent statements: “If I think you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there's an open defiance you will die and if it means many people dying, so be it. That's how it is,” he announced to Reuters."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Solve this math problem Solve 37*o = 47*o for o.","completion":"Alright, imagine you have the same amount of oranges (that's \\"o\\") in two different piles. One pile has 37 oranges and the other has 47 oranges. Now, let's try to figure out how many oranges are in each pile. The math problem says that 37 times the number of oranges is equal to 47 times the number of oranges: 37*o = 47*o. It's like saying there are two friends who have the same number of oranges (o), and the first friend got 37 oranges from another friend, while the second friend got 47 oranges from a different friend. Now, we want to know: Are the numbers of oranges the same for both friends (like, does the first friend have the same number of oranges as the second friend)? Since we know that 37 times the number of oranges equals 47 times the number of oranges, we can remove the same number of oranges from both sides. Let's remove 37 oranges from both piles. Then, we have: 0*o = 10*o (because 47*o - 37*o = 10*o) Now, we have a problem. If there are no oranges in the first pile (0*o), it means there are no oranges in the second pile as well. So, the only way this can be true is if there are zero oranges in both piles. So, the answer to the math problem is that there are no oranges (o = 0). But remember, this is just a fun way to explain a math problem and not really about oranges or fruit. The main idea is that when both sides of the equation are equal and the same variable is being multiplied, like in this case (37*o and 47*o), the only solution that makes sense is when the variable is zero (o=0)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected. Answer:","completion":"The title of the one responsible for turning the girls of Norfolk into lesbian vampires is the Vampire Queen, Carmilla. According to the legend in the story, Carmilla descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil.

The fatal shooting of Alfred Olango has fueled ongoing debates and protests about police violence and racial bias in the United States. This incident serves as a reminder of the need to address these issues and develop comprehensive solutions to avoid further tragedies and to build trust between law enforcement and communities. The involvement of the FBI in the investigation is a sign that local and federal authorities are taking the situation seriously. By examining all available evidence, a transparent and thorough investigation will seek to determine whether the use of force by the police was necessary, and if there were alternative solutions that could have been taken. Developing better training programs for law enforcement officers, specifically when responding to incidents involving individuals with mental health issues, is a significant part of addressing similar cases in the future.

You can use this map in each room of your home to help you know what to place where. Specific spots in the room and specific objects have best possible energies, and the map helps you determine those spots. There is simple version of the map with just the names of the sections, and a more complicated version which gives examples of what all is represented by that section. Align the bottom portion of the map with the door/entryway to the room. Arrange the things that apply to each section on the map in the proper place in your room. In the lower left, place books which represent wisdom. In the middle right, which is “child” and represents creativity, place a musical instrument you play or a place where you can paint. It will take time and careful consideration, but if you want to apply feng shui properly, you need to give the process the proper time. Understanding the map and learning what each section represents is the only way you can apply it properly. Some versions of the Bagua map will have slightly different titles than these listed, but the basic idea of each section is intact. Lower left: Knowledge and growth, which can apply to learning and studying, investing in spiritual wisdom and faith, and personal growth. Lower-middle: Career and work success, which focuses on success in current jobs, getting promotions, moving to new careers, and achieving goals. Lower-right: Travel and helpful people, which applies to safety in travels, relocating to new places, seeking people who will help and mentor you in life. Middle-left: Family relationships and health, which means investing in the strength of your family, expanding your social life, and being committed to personal health. Center: Self or well being, which seeks to achieve harmony with yourself and environment, promote health and overcome illness, increase endurance and vitality. Middle-right: Child or creativity, which represents unlocking creativity, bettering communication and building the future. Upper-left: Wealth and power, which seeks prosperity, generating cash flow, and promoting abundance. Upper-center: Reputation and fame, which seeks public attention, becoming well known, and creating a strong reputation. Upper-right: Love and marriage, which includes improving relationships, attracting love, and increasing self-esteem. This map is a guide for what parts of the room are best for certain objects. It’s very important that you do your best to include something for every section because feng shui is all about creating balance. So if you load one section of the room, maybe the wealth section with ledgers and your piggy bank, but you neglect another section, you will upset the balance of the room. Maybe you don’t have a specific object, or enough space, to place something in every section. Something you can do instead is write down on a piece of paper something you care about which represents that or something you desire that represents that section. This can be a stand-in for the actual object. It’s also important to note that sometimes due to room or house layouts, parts of the map may be missing or partial. You can symbolically apply the feng shui to the wall where the missing section would be. Just make your intent for the missing section clear when you place something there. If you have broken objects around the house, especially things that you use frequently, they are likely to cause you frustration, which leads to negative energy in your home. To counteract this, it’s highly advised that you fix things as soon as they break to promote calm and good energy. The five elements of life are fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Good feng shui in any room or home means having a mix of these elements. Most rooms will have a few of these already, depending on the structure of the room and furniture present. Look around your room and see what elements are already present and consider ways to add the remaining. Candles are the easiest way to add fire to any room. Faucets already bring running water, but in rooms without faucets, consider buying a small fountain which can constantly be running water. Plants are a great way to add earth to a room. If you can’t easily incorporate something physically made of the element, hanging a picture that represents the element is a good alternative. The door to the home is where the energy flows in, so make sure you use the front door as much as you can. If you typically enter through a door besides the main one, consider purposefully using the front door a few times a week to keep good energy flowing in. It’s hard to maintain good energy throughout the house if the door is always closed. If you are having trouble understanding the principles of feng shui, or your particular home is not cooperating with your endeavors, consider hiring a professional who can give you advice on how to apply feng shui to your specific living space. What is a summary?","completion":"Feng shui is an ancient Chinese practice focused on creating balance and harmony in one's living environment. The Bagua map is a tool used to divide a room or space into nine sections, each representing a key aspect of life. By aligning the map with the room's entryway and placing objects that represent each aspect in their respective sections, one can establish a flow of positive energy and create well-being. The nine sections of the Bagua map focus on knowledge and growth, career and work success, travel and helpful people, family relationships and health, personal well-being, creativity and child, wealth and power, reputation and fame, and love and marriage. It is crucial to include objects that represent each section to maintain balance in the room. If space or resources are limited, writing down desires or goals for each section can serve as a stand-in until a physical object is obtained. In cases where a section is missing or partial due to the layout of the house, symbolic applications may be used. To further enhance the space's energy, it is essential to have a mix of the five elements of life - fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Each element can be introduced through various objects, such as candles for fire, fountains for water, and plants for earth. If physical items cannot be included, images or pictures representing the elements can be used as alternatives. Using the front door regularly helps maintain positive energy flow throughout the house. Fixing broken items promptly minimizes negative energy caused by frustration, promoting calm and harmonious energy.

No Q: Carson told Ash the story of how his grandmother lost three children to the flu back in the days before medical advancement. Given the question \\"How would Ash feel as a result?\\", is \\"upset and sad it happened\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"A: Yes, \\"upset and sad it happened\\" is a valid answer as to how Ash would feel as a result of hearing Carson's story about his grandmother losing three children to the flu. This answer is plausible for several reasons, which can be understood by considering various aspects such as empathy, the role of storytelling, and common human experiences. 1. Empathy: Human beings have a natural tendency to empathize with each other's emotions and experiences. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person, which helps in forming social connections. When Ash listens to Carson's tragic story, he would likely feel empathy for Carson's grandmother and the immense loss she endured. This empathetic response would lead Ash to feel upset and sad about the unfortunate events that occurred. 2. The role of storytelling: People often share personal stories as a means of conveying complex emotions, experiences, and ideas. When Carson relates the story of his grandmother's struggles, he is not only sharing a historical account but also inviting Ash to connect on an emotional level. Storytelling is a powerful tool for eliciting emotional responses, and hearing such a heart-wrenching tale would reasonably cause Ash to feel sadness and melancholy. 3. Common human experiences: Although the specific details of Carson's story about his grandmother may be unique, the themes of loss, grief, and adversity are universal human experiences. These emotions transcend cultural, social, and generational boundaries, meaning that Ash could easily relate to the pain and suffering that Carson's grandmother went through. This shared understanding of loss could foster a sense of mutual sadness in both Ash and Carson. 4. Impact of medical advancements: The context of the story, which is set before significant medical advancements, is also worth considering. This would likely highlight for Ash how fortunate we are in the present day to have access to advanced medical technologies and treatments and instill a sense of gratitude while still feeling upset and sad about the past events. This could further deepen Ash's emotional reaction to Carson's story as he contemplates the distressing situation at the time. In conclusion, the answer \\"upset and sad it happened\\" is indeed a valid response to the question of how Ash would feel after hearing Carson's story about his grandmother. Such feelings can be attributed to empathy, the power of storytelling, the universality of human experiences, and the impact of medical advancements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Financial disclosure ordered for military mentors Financial disclosure ordered for military mentors By Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY WASHINGTON  After pressure from two key senators, the Pentagon has reversed course and will require that the retired generals and admirals it hires as consultants file public, not confidential, financial disclosure statements, according to letters from Congress and the Defense Department. Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman and ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, told the Pentagon that \\"senior mentors exercise a level of ... influence\\" that demands public disclosure. They wrote that if the Pentagon resisted, they would propose legislation mandating it. Leigh Bradley, a top Pentagon lawyer, responded to their letter by seeking a ruling from the Office of Government Ethics to require public disclosures. Among the reasons she cited for greater transparency is the mentors' ability to affect Pentagon policy. \\"They will be in a unique position to inform and influence war planning at the highest level and may, ultimately, hold some sway, indirect or otherwise, regarding defense purchasing decisions,\\" Bradley wrote in a Sept. 27 letter. Rep. Robert Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat who chairs a panel on reforming defense acquisition, called the Pentagon's decision a \\"no brainer.\\" \\"Anybody who consults with the Pentagon about the right way to conduct its programs needs to disclose potential conflicts of interest,\\" Andrews said. A USA TODAY investigation last year found that mentors made up to 440 an hour in taxpayer dollars, many times their pay while in uniform. Mentors advise active-duty officers, take part in war games and aid in military planning. The earnings came on top of military pensions as high as 220,000 a year. At the same time, many mentors held jobs with defense contractors selling products and services to the Pentagon. In April, Defense Secretary Robert Gates responded to those findings, capping mentors' pay at 179,000 and requiring public financial disclosures. He also subjected them to rules barring conflicts of interest. The Pentagon, however, retreated from those restrictions this summer. A ruling from the Office of Government Ethics allowed mentors to file confidential disclosure forms. The Pentagon also considered shielding mentors' names, Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said in July. Whitman said Wednesday that the Pentagon is setting up a process that requires mentors to file the public disclosure forms. The new rule will apply to mentors making more than 119,553, according to a letter from William Lynn, deputy Defense secretary. Mandy Smithberger, a national security investigator for the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog group, called the Pentagon's decision \\"fantastic news\\" for open and transparent government.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere Answer:","completion":"The final step of the mentioned process is the contribution of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), to the Earth's atmosphere, which play a major role in the greenhouse effect and climate change. Here's a detailed explanation of the process: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide: As humans breathe, they inhale oxygen (O2) and exhale carbon dioxide (CO2) as a waste product of respiration. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: Fossil fuel-powered engines, such as those found in vehicles and industrial processes, also produce carbon dioxide emissions when fuels are burned. 3. Living things produce waste: All living organisms produce waste, such as fecal matter or decaying plant material, which eventually accumulates in the environment. 4. Waste decomposes: Microorganisms break down this waste through the process of decomposition, which releases various substances, including greenhouse gases, back into the environment. 5. Decomposition produces methane: One of the greenhouse gases released during decomposition is methane (CH4), especially in anaerobic conditions where oxygen is scarce. 6. Water evaporates: Solar energy heats the Earth's surface, causing water to evaporate and become water vapor, joining other gases in the atmosphere. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, and it contributes to the overall greenhouse effect by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In the final step, these greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process in which certain gases, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, maintaining a stable temperature that is suitable for life. However, human activities, like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect and causing global temperatures to rise. This leads to the consequences of climate change, such as more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In fall 2006,the National Basketball Association (NBA)started using basketballs made with synthetic ,or man-made ,material instead of leather .They made the change be- cause they wanted every basketball they use to feel and bounce the same.Not all leather balls are exactly alike in weight or how they bounce,but the synthetic balls are. However,some players complained right away that the new balls bounced differently and were actually harder to control than the leather ones. Physics helped answer questions about why the new balls felt different.For example,the scientists studied friction ,which in this case affects the ability of a player to hold onto a ball.\\"The greater the friction,the better it will stick to his hand,\\"explains a scientist. Tests on both wet and dry balls showed that while the synthetic ball was easier to hold onto when dry,it had less friction and became much harder to hold onto when wet.That's because _ stays on the surface of the synthetic balls but gets taken into the leather balls. The scientists also tested bounce and found that the logo printed on the new balls made their surface uneven and caused them to bounce a little strangely com- pared with the leather balls. In January,the NBA went back to using the leather balls.They aren't perfect,but for now,that's just the way the ball bounces.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Following the events of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk', and have knowledge of many secrets. The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane, later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary super-baby named Kahuna who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives. The film starts with a group of babies in a day care centre. Archie tells the others (Finkelman, Alex, and Rosita) a story about a super baby called Kahuna. Kahuna rescues kids all around the world. According to Archie, Kahuna rescued a group of children from an orphanage run by the evil Kane. Kahuna and Kane are nemeses and hate each other, but Kahuna always wins their battles. Archie's father Stan, who seems to own the day care centre, is letting it be used as a television set by the evil Biscane (yes, in other words, Kane) who is starting up his own TV channel. Archie notices someone spying on the goings-on at the television set in the bushes, but he isn't sure who it is. However, he begins to believe Biscane is evil. He and the other babies sneak into Stan's office and decide to check out Biscane, but are spammed.

But she had a lot of curiosity, which kept her going. She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her. She was on a journey that she thought was to help her be \\"better\\". She carried a big bag with her everywhere she went. Inside it were all the hurts she had experienced. Because she was so eager to please those who offered their wisdom, she willingly agreed with what they said about forgiving. But she held that bag of hurts tightly. After 50 years of carrying that bag around and showing it to all she met as if it were proof that she was a good person, she decided to open it up and just see what happened. When she looked inside it was filled with bits of paper. At one time they had words on them, detailing the hurts. But time had faded the words and all that was left was some useless paper. She had been struggling to carry this bag that held nothing but the image of something that once was. She saw the absurdity of carrying that bag around. It made her laugh.

Article: Playing with toy blocks may lead to improved language development in young children, a new study reported. Early childhood is an important period in the development of young minds. The newborn brain grows three times in size between birth and age 2. Scientists have said that certain activities during this important period may promote healthy development while others may hold it back, and development of memory and language may especially be helped by imaginative play. After six months, language scores among half of the 175 children aged 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 who were sent plastic blocks were 15 percent higher than a matched group that did not receive the free blocks, according to the study by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle. Parents were given ideas about how to help their children play with the blocks, then were told to keep diaries of their children's activities over four days. Finally, all the parents filled out questionnaires that judged their children's vocabulary, grammar, and other language abilities. Study author Dimitri Christakis said unstructured play with blocks motivated children's thinking, memory and physical skills at a time when a child's brain is growing rapidly. \\"They are the foundation of thought and language,\\" he wrote of the skills learned from building blocks. \\"Older children begin to make up stories for these objects .\\" Such play may also take the place of less helpful activities such as watching TV, he said, adding parents ought to have doubts about some toy-makers' words. \\"An increasing number of media-based products are making ungrounded claims that they can make children smarter, more literate, and more musical,\\" Christakis said.

Rachel showed the letter to her friends. No one could read or understand the letter.","completion":"Rachel was perplexed, holding the mysterious letter in her hands as her friends gathered around her, just as baffled as she was. The envelope was plain white, with no return address or any indication of who could have sent it. The written text seemed to be a combination of swirling curves and angular lines, entirely unfamiliar to anyone present. Despite its enigmatic nature, the letter exuded a sort of mysticism that invited curiosity. Determined to uncover the message behind the odd letter, Rachel decided to consult the local professor of linguistics at the nearby university, Professor Andrew Whittaker. Rachel was well-acquainted with Professor Whittaker, as they had collaborated on various art and culture projects for the community in the past. Upon presenting the letter to Professor Whittaker, he too was intrigued by the otherworldly text. Over the course of several days, he studied the writing, searching for hidden meanings and attempting to decipher its code. Unfortunately, despite his expertise and best efforts, the language remained a secret to him as well. During the process of decoding the script, Rachel and Professor Whittaker grew increasingly obsessed with the letter and the potential message hidden within it. They decided to post the images of the letter online to seek help from the vast network of language experts across the globe. As they awaited for any leads, a local news outlet picked up the story and added to the momentum, describing the fantastical narrative of an unknown correspondence discovered by a local resident. Within a week, whispers of the enigmatic letter spread, catching the attention of a renowned anthropologist, Dr. Eloise Tremblay. Dr. Tremblay reached out to Rachel and Professor Whittaker, announcing her intentions of traveling to their town to inspect the letter personally. Intrigue surrounding the foreign script had reached new heights. Upon her arrival, Dr. Tremblay carried a palpable air of confidence and mystery. She examined the letter in great detail, meticulously scrutinizing each line and curve. Finally, after what felt like hours of tense silence, Dr. Tremblay turned to Rachel and Professor Whittaker, her eyes glimmering with excitement. \\"I believe I recognize elements of this script from an ancient civilization I studied a few years ago. The civilization, known as the Eralona people, dates back thousands of years and was believed to have possessed advanced knowledge of spirituality, science, and technology. These symbols could be their sacred language which was thought to have been lost to time,\\" Dr. Tremblay revealed. For days, the trio poured over books and scholarly articles, drawing connections between the mysterious letter and the Eralona civilization. Slowly but surely, they began to unlock the secrets of the language, unveiling a cryptic message about a hidden treasure buried deep within a forgotten temple. The revelation sparked an adventurous spirit within Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Tremblay, inspiring them to embark on an extraordinary journey to find the long-lost ancient treasure. As they set out on this intrepid quest, the trio navigated their way through ancient ruins, deciphering hidden clues and overcoming perilous traps. Bonded by their shared adventure, the trio eventually made their way to the forgotten temple mentioned in the mysterious letter. Through cunning and determination true to the spirit of adventure, they managed to locate the hidden treasure—a remarkable gemstone imbued with magical properties, which could bring balance and harmony to those who wielded its power wisely. Realizing that their discovery was not meant for them alone, Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Tremblay opted to donate the magnificent gemstone to a prominent museum. The artifact became an invaluable piece in the global effort to study and understand the enigmatic Eralona civilization, further fueling the quest for knowledge and the spirit of human curiosity. In the end, the very letter that started off as an unknown oddity became the catalyst of an unforgettable adventure. Not only did it deepen the understanding of a lost civilization, but it forged the unbreakable friendship between Rachel, Professor Whittaker, and Dr. Eloise Tremblay. Moreover, it served as a testament to the notion that sometimes, mysteries have a way of finding those who dare to seek them out, and that bravery and determination can reveal the greatest treasures hidden within the depths of history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the object raised by Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard? H. L. Hunley takes his ship, the H.L. Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E. Dixon in charge. He starts looking for a crew and after some difficulty finally finds enough volunteers to man it. They practice cranking the propeller. The crew do not all get along with each other. Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt. Alexander, is ordered to Mobile, Alabama, and a young soldier who had been volunteering to join the crew is allowed to do so. A:","completion":"The name of the object raised by Brig. Gen. P.G.T.

Her parents, Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse, met in London, married in 1955 and moved to Nigeria. Her parents separated, however, and Anne Hayes returned to England, taking four-year-old Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. In late 1985, the band released their second album, Promise, which peaked at number one in both the UK and the US and became the band's first album to reach number one on the US Billboard 200. The album topped the chart in 1986 and spent two weeks at the peak position. Eventually, the album went on to sell four million copies in the region and was certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album spawned two singles \\"Never as Good as the First Time\\" and \\"The Sweetest Taboo,\\" the latter of which was released as the album's lead single and stayed on the US Hot 100 for six months. \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, number one on the US adult Contemporary chart, and number three on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Sade was so popular that some radio stations reinstated the '70s practice of playing album tracks, adding \\"Is It a Crime\\" and \\"Tar Baby\\" to their playlists. The following year, 1986, the band won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. In 1986, Sade made her acting debut in Absolute Beginners, a film adapted from the Colin MacInnes book of the same name about life in late-1950s London. Sade played the role of Athene Duncannon and lent her vocals to the film's accompanying soundtrack.

Greg said goodbye to his last student at 8:15 PM, locked up the studio, and got into his car. He always looked forward to his evening rendezvous with Bonnie--his nickname for the Bonneville. He liked to put her top down, and drive her around town in the moonlight. Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual.

Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

I'll miss my favorite TV program, Science Fiction Theatre.\\" can be translated as: \\"Nemůžu jít. Zmeškám svůj oblíbený televizní pořad, Sci-fi Divadlo.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"I can't go.\\" - \\"Nemůžu jít.\\" - \\"I\\" translates to \\"já\\" in Czech, but the subject pronoun is often dropped when the verb conjugation gives enough information about the subject. - \\"can't\\" is a combination of \\"cannot\\" which would be translated to \\"nemůžu\\" (nemohu is also acceptable) in Czech, where 'ne' is a negation and 'můžu' (or 'mohu') is the first person singular conjugation of the verb \\"can\\" (in Czech, \\"moci\\" or \\"mít možnost\\"). - \\"go\\" translates to \\"jít\\" in Czech, which is an infinitive form of the verb meaning \\"to go.\\" 2. \\"I'll miss\\" - \\"Zmeškám\\" - \\"I'll\\" is an abbreviation of \\"I will\\" which indicates future tense. In Czech, the future tense can be formed by using the appropriate future conjugation of the verb.

(AP) RAMALLAH, West Bank – Israeli troops shot dead a mentally ill Palestinian who approached them in a West Bank refugee camp Sunday, the army said, while another Palestinian was killed in clashes in the city of Ramallah. Sunday's deaths brought to four the number of Palestinians killed since Israel launched its most extensive military operation in the West Bank in years after the abduction of three Israeli teens on June 12. Israel has arrested more than 350 Palestinians, most affiliated with the Islamic militant Hamas, and raided some 1,600 locations. Israel has blamed the kidnappings on Hamas, which has praised the act, but not claimed responsibility. The sweeps have led to growing confrontations after years of relative calm. Increasingly, Israeli troops entering towns and refugee camps are met by crowds of Palestinian stone-throwers. Eleven human rights groups urged the Israeli military on Sunday to refrain from collective punishment of the Palestinian population. \\"Overall, the measures adopted and their extent do not seem to serve a military need that can justify the damage they have caused,\\" they wrote. There were also signs of growing Palestinian anger at Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who has defended his decision to continue security coordination with Israel, including in the search for the teens. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he has \\"unequivocal proof\\" of Hamas involvement in the abductions. He said he is sharing this evidence with several countries and will make it public soon. Abbas, meanwhile, said he has \\"no credible information\\" that Hamas was involved. \\"When Netanyahu has such information, he needs to update me and we will take care of the matter according to our own laws,\\" he told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. In Ramallah, Israeli troops entered the downtown area at about 2 a.m. Sunday, searching offices in two commercial buildings. Several hundred Palestinians threw stones and flower pots at soldiers who fired live bullets and rubber-coated steel pellets, said Issam Rimawi, a photographer for a local newspaper. After the soldiers withdrew, dozens of protesters hurled stones at a nearby Palestinian police station and smashed windows of parked cars, said Rimawi and a protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid repercussions from the authorities. Palestinian troops fired live rounds, the two witnesses said. After the clashes, the body of Mohammed Ismail, 31, was found on a rooftop opposite the police station, they said. Dr. Saber Aloul, a Palestinian forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy and said Ismail was killed by an M-16 bullet in the shoulder. Palestinian forces do not use M-16s, said a spokesman, Adnan Damiri. The Israeli military, which is known to use M-16s, had no comment. Later Sunday, several dozen people marched in downtown Ramallah to protest Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. \\"Why, why security coordination? We get hit once by the Palestinian Authority and once by the Israeli army,\\" they chanted. Analyst Jihad Harb said the Israeli crackdown is weakening Abbas. \\"The Palestinian street is very angry at the Palestinian Authority and President Abbas in particular because they see him siding with Israel against them,\\" he said. In a separate incident Sunday, 27-year-old Ahmed Saoud was killed by Israeli troops as he walked to a mosque for dawn prayers in the Al-Ein refugee camp, said his father, Assad. The elder Saoud said his son suffered from mental illness. The army said a Palestinian man approached soldiers in a threatening manner early Sunday, and that they fired warning shots before shooting him. The army said an \\"initial inquiry\\" suggested the man was mentally unstable. The Israeli teens went missing as they were returning home from a Jewish religious school in the West Bank 10 days ago. They have not been heard from, and no group has asked for ransom or made other demands. In the Gaza Strip, Israel carried out airstrikes on four militant sites following rocket fire from Gaza into Israel, the army said. Also Sunday, a Palestinian armed with a hand grenade was caught near an Israeli town near the Gaza border, apparently after he broke through the border fence, the army said.

Kenneth Duxbury, an 82-year-old army veteran, was attacked by two drug addicts, Stephen McLeish and John Carroll, who made away with £250 that Mr. Duxbury was intending to use to pay a bill. Kenneth Duxbury had led a quiet and respectable life, spending his younger years serving in the military and subsequently working diligently to provide for his family. His wife, Iris Duxbury, aged 79, had long been his rock in both life and marriage. Together, they raised a loving family and enjoyed a peaceful retirement in their later years. The brutal attack significantly rattled the senior Duxbury's life. According to the family, Kenneth Duxbury was no longer the same man after the harrowing experience. Just a day after he informed his wife about the mugging, Iris Duxbury suffered a stroke. The great-grandmother was immediately admitted to the hospital, but despite the best efforts of the doctors and other medical staff, she passed away on September 12th. Overwhelmed with grief and stress, Mr. Duxbury's health began to deteriorate rapidly. It was clear that the ordeal had taken a significant toll on his well-being, despite the stoic front he initially displayed. Barely 48 hours after his wife's death, Kenneth Duxbury succumbed to his ill health, leaving behind a heartbroken family mourning the loss of two cherished elders. The two career criminals behind the chain of events, Stephen McLeish and John Carroll, were finally brought to justice yesterday. Both men faced a slew of charges related to the mugging, which included robbery and assault. After a somber and emotional trial that saw the Duxbury family recount the tragedy that unfolded, McLeish and Carroll were each sentenced to three years in jail. Justice, however, can only provide a small measure of comfort for the bereaved family members. The tragic story of Kenneth and Iris Duxbury serves as a stark reminder of the indirect consequences that can stem from a single reprehensible act by career criminals. As the community gathers to mourn the loss of the beloved elderly couple, questions are raised about how such tragedies can be prevented in the future. The need for stricter deterrents against repeat offenders and increased support systems for drug addicts are among the topics being debated in the wake of this heart-rending case. In the end, it is the collective responsibility of society to take care of its most vulnerable members and ensure that their golden years remain unblemished by such heinous acts of violence and deceit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm not exaggerating, I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves. The only thing interesting about this movie is the box. On the box it says \\"from the director of the boogeyman\\" so I figured...eh whatever, if this was made recently I'm sure the directing at least won't be TOO bad :-, but after I saw the movie and looked at what \\"boogeyman\\" they were talking about, it's some nonsense from the early 1980's that he made. Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers. ANYWAY, I think that they just liked the name \\"Zodiac Killer\\", and didn't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac's crimes or his MO, or even the years that he was active. All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the \\"stories\\" about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac's crimes did. They also compare the Zodiac to \\"Vampire of Dusseldorf\\" Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz's \\"son\\" quite often. The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike, and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct either, just a bunch of jumbled nonsense. His son even says \\"Don't forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's\\"...His actual name just has one! I think that the writer/director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. \\"Ooh those sound like cool names, let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research! great idea!\\" Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM-IV and getting cured of it. \\"I was also diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered\\", etc. For those of you who don't know, DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems! Haha. Anyway, my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list, and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point.

A:","completion":"A: The leader who played a significant role in the unification of Germany under Prussian dominance was Otto von Bismarck, a Prussian statesman who served as the first Chancellor of the German Empire from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck, also known as the \\"Iron Chancellor,\\" was a master of diplomatic and military strategies and implemented a series of carefully planned policies that ultimately achieved German unification. Born on April 1, 1815, in Schönhausen, Prussia, Otto von Bismarck belonged to an aristocratic family. He studied law and entered civil service in Prussia but left to pursue agriculture and politics. In 1847, Bismarck became a member of Prussia's first elected parliament, where he quickly gained recognition for his conservative and pro-monarchist views. Throughout the 1850s, Bismarck held various diplomatic positions, including Prussian envoy to the German Confederation and ambassador to Russia. In 1862, during a time of political crisis, King Wilhelm I of Prussia appointed Bismarck as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Bismarck's principal objective was to strengthen and expand Prussia's dominance and ultimately unify the numerous independent German states under Prussian control. To achieve this goal, Bismarck pursued a policy known as \\"Blood and Iron,\\" which emphasized the importance of war and force in achieving political objectives. He conducted a series of wars and diplomatic maneuvers between 1864 and 1871 that changed the balance of power in Central Europe and led to the establishment of the German Empire: 1. The Danish-Prussian War (1864): Bismarck formed an alliance with Austria against Denmark, resulting in Prussian-Austrian victory and the acquisition of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. 2. The Austro-Prussian War (1866), also known as the Seven Weeks' War: Bismarck initiated a war against Austria to weaken its influence in the German Confederation. Prussia emerged victorious and replaced the German Confederation with a new alliance, the North German Confederation, under Prussian dominance. 3. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871): Bismarck skillfully engineered a diplomatic crisis with France, leading to war between Prussia and France. The conflict resulted in Prussian victory and the ultimate collapse of Napoleon III's regime. This war marked a turning point in German unification as the southern German states, initially neutral or allied with France during the war, joined the North German Confederation. On January 18, 1871, in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire was proclaimed with King Wilhelm I of Prussia as its first emperor (Kaiser), establishing a powerful new nation state in Europe. Bismarck served as the first chancellor of the German Empire, where he continued to shape its foreign policy and domestic affairs until his dismissal in 1890. In conclusion, Otto von Bismarck was the key figure responsible for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership. His astute diplomacy and military strategies transformed the fragmented collection of German states into a powerful empire, which had a significant impact on European politics and history leading into the 20th century."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Question: Analyze the effects of the digital revolution on freedom of expression, information, and the press, as discussed in the passage. How has the funding for traditional media sources been impacted and what role do new forms of Internet journalism play in mitigating this impact? Answer: The passage highlights that the digital revolution had both positive and negative effects on the mass media landscape in the US and Europe since World War II. On the one hand, the revolution has boosted freedom of expression and access to information. This is mainly due to the democratizing nature of the Internet, which allows virtually anyone to share their thoughts and access information on a global scale with ease. On the other hand, the passage reflects the negative impact of the digital revolution on traditional media sources' funding. The disruption of these funding sources may have come from a decline in advertising revenues and subscription numbers. With the widespread availability of free content online and the shift of consumers toward digital consumption, it is increasingly difficult for traditional media providers like newspapers and magazines to sustain their operations as legacy business models struggle to adapt to the changing market dynamics. Furthermore, the passage indicates that new forms of Internet journalism have only managed to replace a small fraction of what has been lost, indicating that they are not yet a full-fledged solution to the problem. This could be linked to factors such as lower journalistic standards, lack of credibility and trustworthiness, and the inability to generate sufficient revenues to support large teams of experienced journalists. In conclusion, the digital revolution has brought about mixed outcomes in the realm of mass media. While it has fostered freedom of expression and greater access to information, it has disrupted the funding for traditional media sources. New forms of Internet journalism have emerged to fill the void, but they are still far from replacing the lost resources, and additional effort may be needed to ensure the sustainability and continued growth of reliable, high-quality journalism."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the ability to apply heat and pressure simultaneously, it can create lasting impressions on items with precision. However, to achieve the best results, it's crucial to understand how to properly operate the machine. In this article, we will walk you through a step-by-step guide on setting up and operating a heat press machine like a pro. 1. Prepare the workspace and materials Before operating the heat press, ensure that your workspace is clean, well-ventilated, and free of any flammable materials. Keep the machine and all the necessary tools and materials, such as the substrates and transfers, easily accessible. Additionally, always wear heat-resistant gloves while working with the machine. 2. Open the heat press Lift the handle of the heat press to open it. Make sure that there is enough space between the top and bottom plates to place the material you intend to print on, without any obstruction. The open position will also allow you to have a clear view of the control panel where the temperature, pressure, and timer settings will be adjusted. 3. Adjust the temperature The heat press machine's temperature plays a critical role in ensuring proper transfer of the design onto the material. Check the manufacturer's guidelines for the recommended temperature settings when using your chosen transfer paper or vinyl. To set the temperature, locate the temperature control knob or digital panel and adjust it accordingly. Allow the machine to heat up to the desired temperature before proceeding with the printing process. 4. Adjust the pressure An accurate pressure setting is essential for a consistent and flawless print. Too little pressure may result in an incomplete transfer, while too much pressure can cause the material to stretch or the colors to bleed. To adjust the pressure, locate the control knob, which is typically found on the top platen of the machine. Turn the knob clockwise to increase the pressure and counterclockwise to decrease it. It is best to do a test print before starting your project to determine the ideal pressure setting for your material. 5. Set the timer The duration of heat application varies depending on your chosen transfer material and the substrate you're printing on. Check the manufacturer's guidelines for the recommended time settings. The timer can usually be set using a digital display or a mechanical dial on the control panel. Once you have set the timer, ensure it starts counting down when the heat press is closed. This will give you an accurate reading of the time spent in printing. 6. Load and press the material Place the material on the bottom platen of the heat press, positioning it correctly to align with the design you want to print. Place the transfer paper or vinyl on the material, ensuring that it is smooth and wrinkle-free. Close the heat press and secure it by pulling down the handle. Allow the machine to operate for the set time, and once the timer goes off, lift the handle to release the pressure and open the heat press. Carefully remove the transfer paper or vinyl from the material, and let the printed item cool down. Conclusion Operating a heat press machine requires precision and attention to detail. By following this step-by-step guide, you can ensure that your heat press projects are completed with accuracy and produce optimal results. Remember to always consult the manufacturer's guidelines for specific temperature, pressure, and time settings for your chosen materials, and to always wear heat-resistant gloves while operating the machine. With the right knowledge and practice, you can master the art of heat press printing and bring your creative vision to life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence:","completion":"The data provided revolves around the Philippines, a Southeast Asian country consisting of approximately 7,641 islands, with the reference to a notable leader, Maria Lourdes Sereno. Located in the western Pacific Ocean, the Philippines is known for its rich biodiversity, beautiful geography, and a mix of indigenous and foreign-influenced cultural heritage. The nation has a long and complex history, with periods of Spanish colonization (beginning in the 16th century) and American rule (starting in the late 19th century), followed by Japanese occupation during World War II. Finally, the Philippines gained independence as a republic in 1946. As an archipelagic country, the Philippines consists of three main island groups (Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao) and numerous smaller islands. The nation boasts a population of about 109 million, making it the 13th most populous country in the world. The official languages are Filipino (based on Tagalog) and English, with Filipino being predominantly spoken in everyday communication and English being used in government, business, and education. The Philippine economy has been on an upward trajectory in recent years and has been considered one of the fastest-growing countries in Asia. The main economic drivers have been agriculture, industry (e.g., electronics, petroleum refining, and shipbuilding), and the service sector (particularly information and communication technology, as well as the business process outsourcing industry). Maria Lourdes Sereno, the leader mentioned in the data, is a noteworthy figure in the Philippine legal and political landscape. Born on July 2, 1960, she is an accomplished jurist, teacher, and public servant. Sereno earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from the Ateneo de Manila University, and later graduated cum laude from the University of the Philippines College of Law. She also obtained a Master of Laws degree from the University of Michigan. Maria Lourdes Sereno's contributions to her country have been remarkable. She has served in various capacities within the Philippine judicial and legal system, such as working as a legal consultant for the Office of the President, being a law professor at the University of the Philippines, and acting as an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals. However, her most significant role came on August 25, 2012, when Sereno was appointed by then-President Benigno Aquino III as the 24th Chief Justice of the Philippines' Supreme Court. In taking the oath, she made history by becoming the first woman to hold the prestigious position in the country. Sereno became known for her advocacy for judicial reform and commitment to improving the administration of justice. During her tenure as Chief Justice, Maria Lourdes Sereno faced numerous challenges and controversies. In May 2018, an unprecedented decision by her colleagues on the Supreme Court led to her ouster, citing procedural grounds. The event was considered highly controversial and stirred heated debates on the independence of the judiciary and the Philippine Constitution's preservation. In conclusion, the data provides an insight into the Philippines - a culturally diverse, populous, and geographically remarkable Southeast Asian country - and its connection to a prominent, groundbreaking leader, Maria Lourdes Sereno. Her appointment as the first female Chief Justice of the Supreme Court speaks to her resilience and dedication to serving the country and its people, despite the challenges and controversies she faced during her tenure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: You do not get more dark or tragic than \\"Othello\\" and this movie captures the play fairly well, with outstanding performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expresses to the viewer Othello's torment as he falls prey to Iago's lies very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like Iago, seem more crucial to the plot. I have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out, but I know that Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well. If I had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. The director had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and that between Emilia and Desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. On the other hand, maybe the did just meet---like Romeo and Juliet.

Question: - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process of fossil formation is the death and rapid burial of a plant or animal. When an organism dies, decomposition begins almost immediately, as various factors such as scavengers, bacteria, and fungi start breaking down the remains. In order to preserve and transform the organism's remains into a fossil over time, it is essential that the remains are rapidly buried by sediments, such as mud or sand, and protected from these decaying forces. The rapid burial could occur in a number of ways, depending on the environment. For aquatic plants and animals, their remains may settle to the bottom of a body of water, such as a lake, river, or ocean, where sediment in the water column or brought in by currents will accumulate on top of the remains. In terrestrial settings, natural events such as landslides, volcanic eruptions, or floods could quickly cover the organism's remains with soil, ash, or other sedimentary materials. As the sediments accumulate over the remains, the layers of sediment above apply pressure, compacting the lower layers. Over time, this pressure and the percolation of mineralized water through the sediments cause the sedimentary layers to become rock, such as sandstone, shale, or limestone. Concurrently, this process also protects the embedded remains from decay and degradation, eventually leading to the formation of a fossil. Throughout the entire process, the organism's remains undergo several transformations. As the remains decompose, the soft tissues break down, leaving only the harder parts, such as bones, shells, or woody plant tissues. Over thousands or millions of years, the minerals in the surrounding sediments and groundwater gradually replace the organic material in these hard parts. This process, called permineralization or mineralization, turns the original remains into a stable, rock-like fossil, preserving a record of the ancient organism within the layers of rock. In summary, the first step of the fossilization process is the rapid burial of the organism's remains by sediments. This step is critical to protect the organism's remains from decomposition and degradation and to initiate the series of transformations that ultimately lead to the formation of a fossil preserved within the sedimentary rock layers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, left, and President Obama meet in Washington on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters alongside Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Obama said he would consult with U.S. allies before determining a strategy in Afghanistan after last month's elections there. \\"I'm going to take a very deliberate process in making those decisions,\\" Obama said. \\"There is no immediate decision pending on resources, because one of the things that I'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a determination about resources.\\" The United States has about 62,000 U.S. troops in the country, and NATO allies -- including Canada -- have another 35,000.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more. Support in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low. Just 39 percent of Americans favor the war, while 58 percent oppose it, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday.

What is the name of the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945 but also use as early as 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty? The answer is:","completion":"The name of the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945, which was also in use as early as the 2nd century AD and developed rapidly during the Song Dynasty, is the Junk. Junks were ancient Chinese sailing ships that were widely used for centuries in China, and they were primarily designed for long-distance voyages in challenging ocean conditions. The origins of the junk can be traced back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), and their design and construction improved greatly during the succeeding periods, particularly during the Song Dynasty (960 – 1279 AD). The Song Dynasty saw advancements in shipbuilding technology, making junks stronger, faster, and more seaworthy. The distinctive features of the junk include its fully battened sails, which were typically made of bamboo slats or grass mats, providing better control and making the vessel more stable in various wind conditions. The hull of the junk was sturdy and could withstand rough seas, and the watertight compartments made it less prone to capsizing or taking on water. During the 1940s, during World War II, the Royal Australian Army used junks to conduct reconnaissance and patrol missions in the Pacific region. The Australian forces found junks to be a useful and versatile alternative to conventional naval vessels, as they were relatively small, easy to maneuver, and could navigate shallow waters. Although they were not as advanced as the naval ships of the time, they were functional and suited the needs of the Royal Australian Army in specific situations. In summary, the sea-going vessel used by the Royal Australian Army during 1945, which had a history dating back to the 2nd century AD and experienced significant advancement during the Song Dynasty, is the Junk - a versatile and enduring Chinese ship design that played a role in various naval endeavors throughout history."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the professor trying to do while being interrupted by the neighboring office?

She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness. She also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called \\"Hope\\". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore. She leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura. By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.

But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers.

So did 19-year-old Suraj Sharma, the Indian actor who plays him. But it was a lucky chance that opened up the opportunity for the new star.

As the director traveled to Mumbai to find his Pi, the teenager went along with his younger brother, who had acted in a couple of movies, to audition . But little did Sharma know that he would end up winning the role from 3, 000 hopefuls. Lee said he saw Pi in Sharma: \\"Not only does he have a compelling and wise look.

She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death.

MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town.

I complained, \\"Everything has gone wrong.\\" My wife and I were in one tent with our two young kids. A hundred yards east away was Summit Lake, where the glorious early morning mist was shimmering off the water. A couple miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet above sea level, and huge snow dotted the scenery even in mid August. Further west still was Bumpass Hell, with steam rising up. As the sun crept up over the edge of the Lassen peak, we fired up the camp stove and had breakfast. Half an hour later, my six-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen peak trail, getting ready to go up the mountainside. We wouldn't make it all the way, but it didn't matter. We would see nature at its extremes: the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it; the blues of the sky shading into the blues of distant lakes, which in turn shaded into the whites and grays of the snow.

Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government.

In the quarterfinals against Ghana a few days later, it was Donovan who stepped up to take a penalty kick, which he dispatched like the veteran he is, although the U.S would lose in extra time. But now you can call him Lan-done. Or Gone-ovan. Donovan, one of the anchors of the U.S. national soccer team for the last decade, was cut Thursday by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who reduced his 30-man squad to the mandatory 23. For pro soccer players looking to book a spot at the World Cup, the last cut is the cruelest. Joining Donovan on the sidelines were two other 2010 teammates, Maurice Edu and Clarence Goodson. Brad Evans, Michael Parkhurst, Joe Corona and Terrence Boyd were also told they won’t be making the trip. Klinsmann called dumping Donovan “the toughest decision in my coaching career.” “I just see some other players slightly ahead of him,” Klinsmann said. Among those are Aron Johannsson, a 23-year-old, American-born, Iceland-raised forward who plays in Holland and has impressed Klinsmann with his ability to make an impact on a game. He also selected 31-year-old Chris Wondolowski of the MLS San Jose Earthquakes. A few minutes watching Wondo play and you’d think he might be a good addition to your weekend pub team; what he lacks in style he makes up for in his penchant for scoring goals, which is not a bad thing in a World Cup. On the other hand, Klinsmann also picked Jozy Altidore, who plays for Sunderland in England’s Premier League and who has been allergic to the goal this season. Still, Altidore is also 23, and his strength at holding and shielding the ball is valuable. And Klinsmann prefers guys who play in top leagues. That leaves Clint Dempsey, late of Fulham and now with the MLS Seattle Sounders, as his most experienced forward. The least experienced forward is Julian Green, an 18-year-old son of an American father and German mother who plays for Bayern Munich, Germany’s top club, although he spent most of the season on the B team. The squad also includes a number of German-born players—like Green they are sons of American servicemen—whose selection will provide some ruggedness to the squad as well as European experience. They include John Brooks, Timmy Chandler and Fabian Johnson, who play in Germany’s Bundesliga, as well as Jermaine Jones, who now plays for Besiktas in Turkey. Donovan’s omission from the roster, although shocking, isn’t altogether unexpected. When Klinsmann took over as U.S. coach two years ago, he warned the veteran players that their status was meaningless to him. He wanted players to compete for positions at every practice, and have no expectations of starting, which has sometimes been a point of contention within the team. They want to know where they stand. Donovan, burned out from playing constantly in the MLS, in the Premiership for Everton, and for the national team, decided to take a four month sabbatical last year. That never sat well with Klinsmann. In leaving Donovan behind, Klinsmann is giving up a ton of World Cup experience. It’s something that a team such Italy would hesitate to do—the Italians respect maturity in a player, particularly when it comes to high-pressure games. But given the Americans’ ridiculous first- round schedule—Ghana, Portugal, Germany—Klinsmann feels he needs more youth, and perhaps an X factor in players such as Johannsson. Donovan isn’t the first U.S. legend to be let go this way. Before the 1998 World Cup in France, coach Steve Sampson dropped John Harkes, a stalwart, hardnosed footballer he had previously named “Captain for Life” over what was then described as Harkes’ refusal to play as a holding midfielder and other “leadership” issues. The reason was more complicated than that, but Harkes’ exit left Sampson with a hole that his other players couldn’t fill. The U.S. lost three straight in the opening round, including a game against Germany—in which Jurgen Klinsmann, by the way, scored a stunning goal. Sampson lost his job shortly after the tournament. Klinsmann understands that if Donovan’s goalscoring isn’t replicated by one of the 23 he picked, he’s going to suffer the same fate. 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP – U.S. ROSTER BY POSITION | DETAILED ROSTER GOALKEEPERS (3): Brad Guzan (Aston Villa), Tim Howard (Everton), Nick Rimando (Real Salt Lake) DEFENDERS (8): DaMarcus Beasley (Puebla), Matt Besler (Sporting Kansas City), John Brooks (Hertha Berlin), Geoff Cameron (Stoke City), Timmy Chandler (Nürnberg), Omar Gonzalez (LA Galaxy), Fabian Johnson (Borussia Mönchengladbach), DeAndre Yedlin (Seattle Sounders FC) MIDFIELDERS (8): Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake), Alejandro Bedoya (Nantes), Michael Bradley (Toronto FC), Brad Davis (Houston Dynamo), Mix Diskerud (Rosenborg), Julian Green (Bayern Munich), Jermaine Jones (Besiktas), Graham Zusi (Sporting Kansas City) FORWARDS (4): Jozy Altidore (Sunderland), Clint Dempsey (Seattle Sounders FC), Aron Johannsson (AZ Alkmaar), Chris Wondolowski (San Jose Earthquakes) Write a title for it.","completion":"Landon Donovan Cut from U.S. National Soccer Team for 2014 World Cup"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan and Barrie's own novelization of it, Peter and Wendy. The music is mostly by Mark \\"Moose\\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. Several productions of Peter Pan were staged early in the 20th century, starting in London in 1904, starring Nina Boucicault as Peter and on Broadway in 1905, starring Maude Adams. In a nod to the original play, and the pantomime tradition it derives from, the title role of Peter Pan in the musical is usually played by a woman, including Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan and Cathy Rigby, among others. Producer Edwin Lester, founder and director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, acquired the American rights to adapt Peter Pan as a play with music for Mary Martin. The show was not successful in its pre-Broadway West Coast tour, so director Jerome Robbins hired lyricists Comden and Green and composer Jule Styne to add more songs, including \\"Never Never Land,\\" \\"Distant Melody\\" and several other numbers, turning the show into a full-scale musical. The musical, instead of using Barrie's original ending, in which Peter simply let Wendy and the other children return home, includes an additional scene that Barrie had written later and titled An Afterthought (later included by Barrie in his 1911 novelization Peter and Wendy). In this ending, Peter returns after many years to take Wendy back to Never Never Land for spring cleaning. He finds that he has been away so long that Wendy is now an adult, married woman with a daughter. Despondent at first, he is delighted when Wendy's daughter Jane offers to be his new mother, and instead takes her with him. The musical premiered at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on July 19, 1954. The initial four-week run was followed by an eight-week engagement in Los Angeles. The show opened on Broadway on October 20, 1954 at the Winter Garden Theatre for a planned limited run of 152 performances. The busy 1954 Broadway season also included The Boy Friend, Fanny, Silk Stockings and Damn Yankees. While still in tryouts, a deal was made for Peter Pan to be broadcast on the NBC anthology series Producers' Showcase on March 7, 1955, which ensured that it was a financial success despite the limited run. The revised score and Tony Award-winning performances by Martin and Cyril Ritchard made the musical a critical success, and tickets sold out throughout the Broadway run. The show closed on February 26, 1955 to prepare for the television broadcast. A Broadway cast album was made of the songs, and it is still in print today. The show was revived in 1979 on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, produced by Nancy and Ronnie Horowitz, starring Sandy Duncan and George Rose, and ran for 554 performances. Duncan was nominated for the Best Actress Tony, and the show was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical. A third Broadway production was mounted in 1990, originally at the Lunt-Fontanne, running for 45 performances. A return engagement opened 10 months later, this time at the Minskoff Theatre, running for an additional 48 performances. Both engagements starred former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby as Peter; the first co-starred Stephen Hanan and the second J. K. Simmons. The production was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical at the 1991 Tonys, and Rigby was nominated for Best Actress. Rigby returned to Broadway as Peter Pan in 1998 at the Marquis Theatre, with Paul Schoeffler co-starring. This production ran for 48 performances. A return engagement with the same stars opened in 1999 at the George Gershwin Theatre and ran for 166 performances. This engagement was nominated for the 1999 Tony for Best Revival of a Musical. It was then recorded at the La Mirada Theater for broadcast in October 2000 on the A&E Network. The video release cuts the program to about 96 minutes and was shot using eight cameras, produced by Line By Line Productions for McCoy/Rigby Entertainment, directed by Gary Halvorson and produced by Marc Bauman. Designers of the production were John Iacovelli (set), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and Martin Aronstein (lights). Flying illusions are by ZFX Inc. Craig Barna is the musical director. It reconceived the potentially offensive \\"Ugg-a-Wugg\\" song about Native Americans as a percussive dance number. The flying effects were changed to include some flights that were not practical to do in the theatrical version, such as the somersault flips during \\"I'm Flying\\", and electronically erasing the wires. Jack Noseworthy is the only male actor to have played Peter Pan on Broadway; he was an understudy in the revue Jerome Robbins' Broadway. The Darling Nursery As Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for an evening out, two of their children, Wendy and John, play at being their parents.

When Mr. Darling comes in to have his tie tied, he questions having a dog as a nursemaid, but Mrs. Darling defends her. The previous week, while the children slept, Nana saw a boy in the room who flew out of the window before she could catch him, leaving behind his shadow, which Mrs. Darling has put away in a drawer. In spite of this, Mr. Darling insists on Nana spending the night downstairs. Mrs. Darling and the children sing a lullaby (\\"Tender Shepherd\\"). The children fall asleep. A fairy, Tinker Bell, and Peter Pan fly in through the window to look for his shadow. Wendy is woken up by the boy's cries when he is unable to re-attach his shadow and helps him by sewing it back on.

Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Your profile is your first impression in the online dating world, and it can make or break whether potential partners are interested in you. Consider these areas: Your username. Consider basing it in your initials, favorite number, or favorite hobby. Avoid using words like \\"hot,\\" \\"sexy,\\" \\"daddy,\\" or any sexualized descriptor in your username — most women will read it as creepy. Choose a good profile picture. Your profile picture should follow three rules: it should be recent, provide a good look at your face, and make you seem approachable. If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one! Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you. Avoid professional headshots. They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard. Your bio. Most websites will provide a short bio or \\"about me\\" section for you to fill in. Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are. You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person. Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship. \\"Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot\\" reads as \\"bitter and angry\\" instead of \\"dateable and balanced.\\" Your interests. Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies. Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile. Who you're interested in meeting. Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters. You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify. Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you. If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park. Don't say \\"I just want someone to talk to\\" — no girl wants to be \\"just someone to talk to\\" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life. Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster. For instance, you might try something like \\"I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is.\\" Your contact settings.

Here is a question about this article: The key characteristic of classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation, creating a musical part or score. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: J.S. Bach's fugues, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be impossible in the heat of live improvisation. The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The body goes through a kidney transplant happens, how will it affect \\"Kidneys cant filter the blood\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, is based on the situation where a person undergoes a kidney transplant. In this context, the question asks how this transplant would affect the kidney's ability to filter blood if it was assumed that \\"kidneys can't filter the blood.\\" We will analyze this situation by examining the steps of the blood filtration process and determine if there are any direct or indirect effects on this process due to the kidney transplant. First, let's briefly recap the process of blood filtration in the kidneys: 1. Blood is carried into the kidney by the renal artery. 2. Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood. 3. The waste that is filtered out mixes with water. 4. This waste and water mixture becomes urine. 5. Ureters carry the urine out of the kidneys. Now, let's consider the kidney transplant's impact on this process. A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure in which a patient with kidney failure receives a healthy kidney from a donor, either living or deceased. The new kidney is connected to the patient's existing renal artery, vein, and ureter so that it can perform the blood filtration process as a replacement for the failing kidney. If we assume that the transplanted kidney is healthy and functioning correctly, the impact on the process of blood filtration should be positive. The transplanted kidney will be able to filter blood and function as a normal kidney, directly negating the hypothesis that \\"kidneys can't filter the blood.\\" This is because the transplanted kidney contains functioning nephrons that can effectively filter out waste, leading to urine formation. Consequently, the person should experience an improvement in their kidney function, leading to an overall improvement in their health. However, it is possible for complications to arise during or after the transplant process, and these complications could indirectly affect the blood filtration process. For example: 1. Transplant rejection: The recipient's immune system may recognize the transplanted organ as foreign and mount an immune response against it, resulting in transplant rejection. This rejection could damage or impair the new kidney's function and its ability to filter blood. In this case, the perturbation indirectly affects the blood filtration process. 2. Infections: Infections, either in the transplanted kidney or elsewhere in the body, can result from a weakened immune system due to immunosuppressive medications that are necessary to prevent transplant rejection. An infection can impair kidney function or the overall health of the patient, indirectly affecting the blood filtration process. 3. Surgical complications: Issues that can arise during surgery, such as damage to blood vessels, nerves, or other structures, can potentially affect the blood filtration process indirectly by impairing the transplanted kidney's ability to function properly. In conclusion, a kidney transplant is designed to replace a person's failing kidney with a healthy one, allowing the blood filtration process to resume normally. If the transplant is successful, it directly negates the hypothesis that \\"kidneys can't filter the blood,\\" and blood filtration should see improvement. However, the perturbation hypothesis could still indirectly affect the blood filtration process if complications occur during or following the transplant procedure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Omkara Movie plot: Omkara Shukla or Omi (Ajay Devgan) is a bahubali, a sort of political enforcer. He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dollyâs father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omiâs head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, \\"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee.\\" After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving an MMS sex scandal, Omkara eliminates a powerful electoral rival.

When his colleague, Carolyn Polhemus (Greta Scacchi), is found raped and murdered in her apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty takes charge of the investigation. The election for District Attorney is approaching and Tommy Molto (Joe Grifasi), the acting head of the homicide division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia (Tom Mardirosian). Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had an affair with Carolyn. When he had shown little ambition, and would have therefore been of little use in advancing her career, Carolyn abruptly dumped him. He has since made up with his wife, Barbara (Bonnie Bedelia), but is still obsessed with Carolyn. Detective Greer (Tucker Smallwood) is initially in charge of the case, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer (John Spencer), whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon realizes that Tommy Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. David Martosko. PUBLISHED:. 15:15 EST, 13 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:05 EST, 13 September 2013. Former presidental adviser David Axelrod was the victim of a putsch within Obama's re-election campaign inner circle, according to a new book. The man most responsible for getting Barack Obama to the White House – the man who had 'crafted his ads since 2004' and 'had cowritten his narrative' – was forced out of the president's inner circle during the 2012 re-election campaign, a new book reveals. Obama's two main campaign generals marginalized David Axelrod, the campaign strategist behind Obama's 1990s rise to power from local organizer to president. White House communications director David Plouffe and re-election campaign manager Jim Messina were in open conflict with 'Axe' throughout much of the re-election push. Axelrod, insiders said, referred to them as 'two strongmen running the Kremlin.' He believed Plouffe, busy in the White House, wasn't plugged into the campaign enough. And he thought Messina, whom Obama had trusted to 'run a business' in getting him re-elected, was insecure and lacked strong leadership skills. MSNBC online editor Richard Wolffe interviewed political insiders about the campaigns for his book, 'The Message.' The Daily Beast published an excerpt on Thursday. He details how Axelrod tried to muscle Messina out of his job entirely, but ended up as the odd man out himself. Obama For America director Jim Messina (L) got tired of Axelrod agitating to get him fired, writes Richard Wolffe. Ultimately it was Axelrod who was ousted. Messina has stayed on, and now runs the campaign's successor organization, Organizing for Action. David Plouffe, who ran Obama's first presidential campaign, inherited Axelrod's White House job hear the Oval Office. There was no love lost between the two. Richard Wolffe, formerly of Newsweek magazine but now in charge of MSNBC.com, got access to many of the major players behind Obama's political successes. 'Axelrod repeatedly tried to convince other senior aides to bypass Messina,' Wolffe writes, 'and they believed he was trying to oust Messina altogether. Axelrod had never wanted him to get the job in the first place. Now he was complaining to others inside Obama’s inner circle about Messina’s shortcomings, but there was no support for a change of campaign manager.' 'Axelrod knew that Plouffe had confidence in Messina, and nobody could come up with a good candidate to replace him. \\"For a good six months of that campaign, they were trying to wedge him out, which created all of the divisions,\\" said one senior Obama campaign official. \\"But there was no one else, and Messina had positioned himself with Plouffe. Axe had tried a long time to prevent him from getting that job.\\" The affable Axelrod ultimately left the operation after he left his job managing messaging from a perch near the Oval Office, along with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. 'There never was another serious candidate for the position' of campaign manager, other than Messina, Wolffe relates. 'Plouffe had handed him operational control of the 2008 campaign. And the following year, in the White House, Plouffe had once again told Messina to run Chicago.' 'Implicit in that offer was the notion that the two operatives could maintain their working alliance: Plouffe would set the course and steer the strategy, while Messina would run the machine. Plouffe could stay inside the White House, close to POTUS, while still controlling a headquarters 700 miles away. Hands-off: Barack Obama stayed away from the palace intrigue and stayed focused on retail campaigning, leaving his inner circle to fight among themselves. Plouffe (L) remains an integral part of the Obama White House, determining the course of the administration's external communications -- a job Axelrod held until 2011. The campaign itself never really. stopped, as political observers noted during Obama's first term. Obama. For America, his campaign committee, continued to operate hundreds of. field offices in key swing states while the president was busy. governing. And the ad buys continued long before Obama was renominated as the Democrats' 2012 candidate. 'The Message: The Reselling of President Obama' by Richard Wolffe is due in stores on Sept. 19. All that continuous campaign muscle needed leadership. And all the jockeying for position brought tension on a grand scale. When 'Axe' left the White House late in the re-election season, he soon after left the campaign operation. That, Wolffe writes, was just the way Messina and Plouffe wanted it. Plouffe, for one thing, had already inherited Axelrod's White House job, and his office near Obama's. Axelrod brought some of the resentments upon himself by hiring an attorney to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking what he called 'a very, very small percentage' of the cost of every TV ad the campaign ran -- in addition to his monthly fees. 'Messina told friends that he was acting under the president’s direction,' Wolffe writes, 'which he characterized like this: \\"I want everybody treated fairly, but I don’t want anybody to get rich on this. They’re gonna get rich on the books they write afterwards.\\"' 'Many of those who worked with Messina doubted his accounts of conversations with Obama or Plouffe. But he acted as if he was empowered by them, and he was. Messina and Axelrod negotiated hard, as Messina hacked away at Axelrod's demands.' Meanwhile, Obama himself stayed above the fray. Axelrod, now without his trademark moustache, has retained a silent consultant's role with Obama, but no longer wields serious power inside his political organization. It's a 'business': Obama offered Messina the top campaign job, telling him he could run what amounted to a giant business venture from the headquarters in Chicago. No love lost: Axelrod and Plouffe reportedly worked together but tussled in a power struggle that left Axelrod without a formal campaign role. 'Obama kept a close team of younger male staffers to manage his immediate needs,' Wolff writes, 'and that was all he needed. \\"He needs the guys to play cards and golf, and tell him where he’s going next and why,\\" said a former aide.' '\\"But beyond that, it’s what function you have. And if you can’t fulfill that function anymore, or someone can do it better, you’re gone. That’s hard for those of us who really believe in him. He expects full loyalty. But you need to have your eyes open.\\"' A hands-off manager, the president didn't like mixing it up between disagreeing staffers, according to the book. '[A]dvisers suspected he knew about the conflicts but pretended they didn’t exist because he had no desire to resolve them, and because he hoped they might peter out. Obama wanted consensus on communications and strategy, not personal conflict.' That left the big guns to fight it out among themselves. Behind Plouffe's and Messina's 'intensely competitive exteriors, they nurtured intensely competitive interiors' as well, the book recounts. But unlike Axelrod and Gibbs, they 'were still on the inside ring of Obama’s circle of confidants' and survived. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"The article discusses the conflict and power struggle within President Obama's re-election campaign during 2012. Key points include: 1.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Consumer Prices Post Sharp Annual Drop WASHINGTON -Consumer prices were flat in July as energy costs retreated following a big surge in June. Over the past 12 months, prices dropped the most in nearly six decades as the recession and lower energy costs kept a lid on inflation. The Commerce Department says consumer prices showed no changed in July, in line with analysts' expectations and far below the 0.7 percent jump in June. Prices fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest annual decline since a similar drop in the period ending in January 1950. Most of the past year's decline reflects energy prices falling 28.1 percent since peaking in July 2008. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. WASHINGTON (AP) — Retail sales dropped in July, government data showed, reinforcing concerns among economists that consumers won't spend enough to help a recovery take hold. But Friday is expected to bring better news: July inflation is expected to have remained flat, and industrial production is likely to have grown for the first time in nine months. Thursday's retail sales report served as a reality check for an economy that lately has appeared poised to emerge from recession and grow again. Consumer spending powers about 70 percent of economic activity. The Cash for Clunkers rebate program helped give auto sales their biggest jump in six months in July, but sales sank elsewhere. Gas stations, department stores, electronics outlets and furniture stores all suffered. Overall, sales fell 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said, after two months of modest gains. Economists had expected a 0.7 percent increase. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.6 percent, also much worse than predicted. Unemployment, flat wages, tighter credit, fear of layoffs and the urge to save more have caused many consumers to spend less. Shrinking home equity and stock portfolios have compounded the problem. As a result, \\"households are in no position to drive a decent economic recovery,\\" Paul Dales, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients. Even Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had managed to post robust sales during the recession, reported an unexpected drop in quarterly earnings. The company faulted lower prices for groceries and other products. But it warned that the economy continues to force customers to scale back their purchases. Still, low prices should provide some comfort for consumers. The worst recession since World War II has kept prices in check, as workers can't demand higher pay due to the scarcity of jobs. Companies have been unable to boost prices because of weak demand. Over the 12 months ending in June, consumer prices fell 1.4 percent, the biggest decline in almost six decades. That trend is expected to continue when the Labor Department reports the consumer price index figures for July on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The latest figures came just a day after the Federal Reserve said the economy appeared to be \\"leveling out.\\" The Fed, signaling the recession appears to be ending, said it would hold interest rates at their current record lows. The success of Cash for Clunkers is also expected to push industrial production up 0.3 percent in July. If the forecast is correct, the increase would come after industrial production fell in 17 of the previous 18 months. The report is slated to be released Friday at 9:15 a.m. EDT. But some analysts say people buying cars under Cash for Clunkers might be holding that money back from other sectors of the economy where they might otherwise spend it. Some of Europe's largest economies also benefited from government programs to support the auto industry. Germany and France returned to economic growth in the second quarter, raising hopes the recession will end throughout Europe sooner than thought. In the United States, weak retail sales were widespread in July. One gauge that excludes autos, gas and building materials fell slightly, the fifth straight month of declines. Department store sales fell 1.6 percent last month. And the broader category of general merchandise stores, which includes big chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., dropped 0.8 percent. Gas station sales plunged 2.1 percent in July — more because of falling prices at the pump than shrinking demand. On Wall Street, stocks rose modestly. The Dow Jones industrials finished up about 37 points at just above 9,398 — their highest close since the market lows of early March. Employers cut the fewest number of jobs in July in nearly a year, and the unemployment rate fell for the first time in 15 months. But jobs remain scarce. More than 6.2 million Americans are receiving jobless benefits, the government said Thursday — 140,000 fewer than the previous week. Counting people taking advantage of an unemployment benefits program enacted by Congress, 9.25 million people received unemployment compensation in the week that ended July 25, down about 100,000 from the week before, as new claims rose but some recipients ran out of benefits and fell off the rolls, economists said. The nonprofit National Employment Law Project has calculated that 540,000 people will exhaust their emergency benefits without finding work by the end of September. And by the end of the year, it predicts 1.5 million will run out. That prospect has some in Congress calling for a further extension of benefits. Obama administration officials have said they would support an extension. AP Business Writers Martin Crutsinger and Alan Zibel in Washington, and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.","completion":"In July, US consumer prices remained flat due to reduced energy costs, and over the past year, prices experienced the largest drop in almost six decades.

Despite the popular Cash-for-Clunkers program boosting auto sales, retailers saw a decrease in sales in July, causing concerns for economists who believe consumer spending is essential to support an economic recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With so many photos and videos of cats and dogs doing cute things online, it's easier than ever to answer which of these furry friends you like more. There are many reasons why people prefer one type of pet over the other. So, have you ever wondered what your preference for cats or dogs says about you? In fact, a 2010 study done by Sam Gosling , a psychologist at the University of Texas, US, and his graduate student Carson Sandy found that dog people are more extroverted agreeable and serious than cat people. \\"Cats will occasionally engage in social activities, but usually after only a few minutes they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown lull, for hours at a lime,\\" said Modem Dog magazine. Just on the basis of dogs' nature being more sociable than cats', you may expect that the personalities of dog people also reflect higher sociability. And Cosling's study found that dog people are generally about 15 percent more extroverted and 13 percent more agreeable, both of which are associated with social altitude. In addition, dog people are 11 percent more conscientious than cat people. \\"Conscientiousness\\" is a tendency In show self-discipline ,to complete tasks and aim for achievement. This quality also shows a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. In comparison, cat people an; about 12 percent more anxious, but they are also 11 percent more \\"open\\" than dog people, due to a general appreciation for art, emotion, imagination, curiosity, adventure, unusual ideas and variety of experience. And people high on openness are more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. Despite vast differences, there an some things that cat people and dog people have in common. \\"Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing and generally optimists. \\" noted Mother Nature Network.

The latter was a veteran of the Russian Civil War. The plan envisaged the main attack aimed at Tallinn, with subsequent coups in Tartu, Narva, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Kunda, and Kohila. The revolt was supposed to start at 5:15 a.m. The 279 communists, mostly infiltrated from the Soviet Union, were armed with 5 Thompson light machine guns, 55 rifles, 65 hand grenades, 8 explosive devices and 150 pistols. It was mistakenly expected that the workers and soldiers would join the insurgency and would seize power in the capital together. The plan called for the establishment of an Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and of a \\"working people's government\\". Most of the schemes were spoiled by the Trial of the 149 in November 1924, which eliminated many potential communist organisers. The gunmen's first priority was to take over the Estonian National Defence College based in the Tondi suburb south of the city centre, the main narrow gauge railway station in Tallinn-Väike, and a battalion of engineering troops in Nõmme. Based on the above article, answer a question. How many less Thompson light machine guns did the communists have than explosice devices?","completion":"Okay, so the communists had 5 Thompson light machine guns and 8 explosive devices.

Please answer the following question: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world. Before embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the location names from the question if present. B denotes the first item of a phrase and an I any non-initial word. Identifier used for the location name - LOC. . There can be instances with no location name entity, then return 'None'. Problem:Branco werd meteen gearresteerd toen hij het geld had aangenomen . Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the question in the Dutch language. Usage: \\"Branco werd meteen gearresteerd toen hij het geld had aangenomen.\\" Explanation: Since the prompt states that the input will be in Dutch, be prepared to analyze sentences written in Dutch. In this example, the sentence translates to \\"Branco was immediately arrested when he had accepted the money.\\" Part #2: Identify the location names from the question if present. Usage: None Explanation: From the given sentence, there are no location names mentioned. We have a person's name, Branco, but no locations. So, the response would be 'None'. Part #3: Use the \\"B\\" and \\"I\\" notation for the first and subsequent words of the location phrases. Usage: None Explanation: There are no location names in the example sentence, so there is no need to use \\"B\\" and \\"I\\" notation for this specific example. However, if there was a location, for example, \\"Branco werd gearresteerd in Amsterdam\\", the notation would be \\"B-Amsterdam\\" indicating the beginning of the location name. Part #4: Use the identifier \\"LOC\\" for the location name. Usage: None Explanation: In this specific example, we don't have any location names, so we don't need to apply the \\"LOC\\" identifier. But, if we had a location name like \\"Amsterdam\\" in the sentence, the response would be \\"LOC: B-Amsterdam\\" to indicate it's a location entity. In summary, for this example, since there are no location names in the sentence, the solution would be: Solution: None"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Martha's Aunt Lily, an unemployed, elderly actress, lives with the two of them, and teaches elocution. After two years of engagement to Dr. Joe Cardin (James Garner), a reputable OB/GYN, Karen finally agrees to set a date for their wedding. Joe is related to rich Mrs. Amelia Tilford, whose granddaughter, Mary, is also going to the Dobie-Wright School. Mary is a problematic, conniving child, often bullying her classmates. In particular, she blackmails Rosalie Wells, whom she caught stealing a bracelet.One day, Mary lies to Lily about skipping part of her elocution class. Karen tries to comfort Mary, saying, \\"If you need to let off steam, just tell us the truth and we'll try to understand,\\" but Mary sociopathically sticks to her lie. Karen punishes her by refusing to let her attend the weekend's boat races. A furious Mary exacts her revenge by inventing a story about Martha and Karen being involved in a love affair. Her tale is based on fragments of a quarrel that Mary's roommates accidentally overheard. Mary tells her grandmother that she observed the two women kissing each other. Mrs. Tilford believes her granddaughter, and immediately informs the other parents. As a result, all girls are withdrawn from the school, without giving Karen or Martha any explanations.

Answer the following question: John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Answer:","completion":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than particles in test B. The reason for this is that raising the temperature increases the energy of the reactants. In John's tests, he warmed up the reactants in test A and cooled them down in test B. Warming up the reactants increases their temperature and hence their energy. This is evident in terms of molecular behavior, where particles move faster and collide more often and with greater force when they have higher energy, making chemical reactions occur more quickly. Cooling the reactants in test B lowers their temperature and consequently reduces their energy. Hence, the particles move slower and collide less often and with less force, slowing down the rate of reactions. This principle is also evident in John's practical tests C and D. The food item kept at a lower temperature in the refrigerator (test C, analogous to test B) spoils slower due to reduced reaction rate, while the food item kept at room temperature on the table top (test D, similar to test A) spoils faster due to increased reaction rate as result of higher temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To make strawberry jam, it's best to remove the top, grassy portion (also known as the hull or calyx) of the strawberry prior to use. This is because the hull is inedible and may have a bitter taste which can affect the flavor of the jam. Additionally, removing the hulls allows for a smoother jam consistency. Option 2, pureeing the entire strawberry without removing any portion of it, is not correct because it includes the inedible hulls in the jam-making process.

Sleepwalking can last a few seconds , a few minutes, or more. Sleepwalking can be an indication that certain parts of the brain may not be relaxing properly at bedtime. It can be caused by illness or fever, tiredness, stress or anxiety. It is thought to occur in the beginning, slow-wave stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep before dream sleep. It may be related to the lack of magnesium , and it is very possible that hormonal changes in body could cause it. Certainly a child is more likely to be a sleepwalker if one of his parents suffered, too . Sleepwalking itself is not dangerous and is generally not a sign of any more worrying problems. But if your child sleepwalks regularly, you have to take safety measures to make sure that he doesn't hurt himself while sleepwalking. Makes sure that any doors can't be opened by a child, and lock doors to the cellar, kitchen and other dangerous places. Check each night before lights go out for sharp objects or, indeed , anything on the floor which your child could trip over or hurt himself on. A child may sleepwalk once and never sleepwalk again.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would experiment B's hydroxide have smaller or larger surface area than experiment A's hydroxide? In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. Hint: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur.","completion":"The hydroxide from Experiment B would have a larger surface area than the hydroxide from Experiment A. Step 1: Understand the provided explanation and the physical process involved. The question focuses on the difference between solid pellets of NaOH and ground NaOH and relates this to the surface area of hydroxide ions available for reactions. The hint uses a hypothesis that grinding the pellet into smaller pieces would greatly increase the total surface area. Step 2: Apply it to the given experiments. In experiment A, solid pellet of NaOH was used. This implies that the hydroxide ions (from NaOH) having direct exposure to HCl gas is limited, i.e., only those on the surface of the pellet can react. This provides a relatively smaller surface area. However, in Experiment B, the NaOH was ground up. The process of grinding means more 'surfaces' of the pellet are exposed, i.e., more hydroxide ions would be on the surface rather than the interior. As these hydroxide ions are now exposed, they can react with HCl molecules. This implies a greater total surface area for the reaction. Thus, simplified logic tells us that the ground NaOH (from Experiment B) would have a larger number of hydroxide ions exposed/available when compared to solid pellets (from Experiment A). Therefore, the surface area of the hydroxide in experiment B will be larger than in experiment A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

True to form, those who evaluated Seven Faces, such as Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times, did go into considerable detail regarding plot twists, as related herein below.Papa Chibou, the elderly caretaker of Musée Pratouchy, a Parisian wax museum, feels a strong kinship with the figures, particularly with that of Napoleon. He spots at the waxworks a romantic young couple, Georges, a lawyer, and Helene, the daughter of a stern judge who disapproves of his daughter's choice and forbids her to see Georges. Papa Chibou suggests to them that they can still stay in touch, without disobeying her father's directive not to speak with each other, by placing secret personal messages in the pockets of Napoleon's uniform.

Researchers compared the life spans of elephants in European zoos with those living in Amboseli National Park in Kenya and others working on a timber enterprise in Buma. Animals in the wild or in natural working conditions had life expectancies twice than or more of their relatives in zoos. Animal care activists have urged in recent years to discourage keeping elephants in zoos, largely because of the lack of space and small numbers of animals that can be kept in a group. The researchers found that the _ life span for African elephants in European zoos was 16.9 years, compared with 56 years for elephants who died of natural causes in Kenya's Amboseli Park. Adding in those elephants killed by people in Africa lowered the median life expectancy there to 35.9 years. For the more endangered Asian elephants, the median life span in European zoos was 18.9 years, compared with 41.7 years for those working in the Burma Timber Enterprise. Median means half died younger than that age and half lived longer. There is some good news, though. The life expectancies of zoo elephants have improved in recent years, suggesting an improvement in their care and raising, but \\"Protecting elephants in Africa and Asia is far more successful than protecting them in Western zoos.\\" There are about 1,200 elephants in zoos, half in Europe, researchers concentrated on female elephants, which make up 80 percent of the zoo population.

Question: How can butterflies help plant? Context: Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology. Answer:","completion":"Butterflies can help plants through the process of pollination. As they move from flower to flower to consume energy-rich nectar, they inadvertently carry pollen on their bodies. This pollen then gets transferred to different flowers, enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction in plants. The bright coloration of flowers and their attractant pheromones help guide pollinators like butterflies. This mutualistic relationship is critical for most flowering plants and forms the basis of complex plant-animal adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sarah has been caught after having cheated multiple times on Christine's friend, so","completion":"Christine decided to confront Sarah about her deceitful behavior. With a heavy heart, Christine knew that it was her responsibility to call out Sarah's actions and support her friend during this challenging time. Sarah had never given any indication that she would be unfaithful, so the betrayal came as a shock to everyone around her. The news spread like wildfire, and as Christine prepared to confront Sarah, she felt a mix of emotions, including disappointment, anger, and sadness. Before the confrontation, Christine spent a few days collecting evidence and speaking with mutual friends to gather a full picture of Sarah's multiple affairs. She wanted to lay out the facts and confront Sarah with the truth, hoping that this would lead to a meaningful conversation and some much-needed closure for their friend group. As Christine approached Sarah, she couldn't help but notice the oblivious, carefree smile plastered on her face. With her heart pounding, Christine took a deep breath and calmly explained that she was aware of the cheating. The smile on Sarah's face faltered, and she immediately became defensive. \\"What are you talking about? I didn't cheat!\\" Sarah protested, trying to deny the truth. Christine, however, was well-prepared. She presented the text messages, social media posts, and shared accounts from their mutual friends, leaving no room for denial. Sarah's face turned beet red as she sat in silence, realizing that there was no way to worm her way out of this situation. The gravity of her mistakes had finally hit her. It was one thing to cheat and deceive one person, but it was another thing entirely when it affected an entire close-knit friend group. As Sarah stumbled over her words and began her feeble attempts to justify her actions, Christine remained calm and collected. Her voice firm, Christine expressed her deep disappointment and asked her to take responsibility for her actions. Christine tried to make Sarah understand the pain and betrayal she had inflicted on her friend and the group. To Sarah's credit, she ultimately admitted her guilt, explaining that she had felt unfulfilled in her relationship and had sought solace elsewhere. While Sarah's actions were inexcusable, Christine was at least glad to see some level of accountability and contrition. With a heavy heart, Christine told Sarah that their friendship could never be the same. Trust, once shattered, could not be easily repaired. Christine encouraged Sarah to learn from this experience, seek professional help and truly reflect upon her actions. As days turned into weeks, Christine focused on supporting her friend through the heartbreak. An emotional roller coaster, her friend's coping journey was filled with both difficult days and small triumphs. Being there for her friend was Christine's priority, and she made sure to put her friend's well-being first. Eventually, their friend group began to find a sense of stability and healing in their newly adjusted dynamics. Sarah's cheating ultimately forced everyone involved to confront painful realities and altered the friendships once held dear. Trust had been broken, hearts left shattered, and a long journey of self-reflection and growth lay ahead. Through it all, however, the experience provided a valuable lesson for everyone involved in the importance of trust, communication, and integrity in relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour. Imagine.. Actual comedies were made! Movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring. During the 90's and 00's several really great movies were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. Movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. It became the norm! Then came United... *MINOR SPOILERS* It's just simply not funny. Not once. Not ever. But the thing is... We THINK its funny. Because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians. But.. They neither say nor do anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me the humor! Is it the awkward clerk played by Harald Eia? Is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie? The movie is just not funny! But thats not my main rant about United. That namely is the predictability. (And it is here I fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since I have seen this in many other movies as well.) All the time you just know its going to end well. All characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie, and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There's absolutely no room for surprises at all! All in all I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie.

Both sentences mean the same thing, as they convey that the \\"Definitive Edition\\" was published as a single hardcover. However, they are structured differently, which brings slight variation in emphasis and tone. In the first sentence, \\"The single hardcover 'Definitive Edition' was also published,\\" the word \\"also\\" suggests that this publication might be part of a series of events or an additional item published alongside other works. The use of \\"also\\" indicates that the single hardcover publication is supplementary information with respect to a broader context. Nonetheless, this emphasis is a matter of nuance and doesn't significantly alter the core meaning of the sentence. The second sentence, \\"Also the single hardcover 'Definitive Edition' was published,\\" employs a slightly different structure by placing the word \\"also\\" at the beginning. This choice can imply that the sentence is part of a larger conversation or list, and the reader is being presented with further information on the topic. Still, the fundamental meaning remains the same: the \\"Definitive Edition\\" was published as a single hardcover.

Therefore, the categorization of Panthiades ochus, as mentioned in this text, would accurately fit under the subject of 'animal'. Remember, butterflies are a highly diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of species spread across the globe.

Read this and answer the question A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 – making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States – with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and a Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island, later called New Amsterdam (Nieuw Amsterdam). The colony of New Amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower Manhattan. The Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small band of the Lenape, in 1626 for a value of 60 guilders (about 1000 in 2006); a disproved legend says that Manhattan was purchased for 24 worth of glass beads.

Process: - The kidneys receive blood through the renal artery - The blood is passed through the nephrons in the kidneys - The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no lava in the chambers happens, how will it affect there is excess water and waste. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the supposed perturbation of having no lava in the chambers does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of kidney filtration and waste removal. This perturbation appears to be unrelated to the functioning of the kidneys because lava chambers are geological formations typically found in volcanic regions, whereas the process of kidney filtration and waste removal occurs within the human body. To understand why this perturbation does not have an effect on the kidney filtration process, it is essential to explore the process in detail. 1. Blood enters the kidneys through the renal artery: The kidneys receive oxygenated blood, which contains waste products generated by cellular processes, from the aorta through the renal arteries. 2. Blood is passed through the nephrons in the kidneys: Nephrons are microscopic filtration units within the kidneys. Each kidney houses approximately one million nephrons, which consist of a glomerulus and a renal tubule. The glomerulus is a complex network of capillaries, while the renal tubule is a series of tubular structures. 3. The kidneys filter waste from the blood: As blood flows through the glomerulus, water, salts, glucose, amino acids, and waste products are filtered out of the blood and into the renal tubule. The filtering process is enabled by differences in pressure and specialized filtration membranes within the glomerulus. 4. Clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys: Essential components like glucose, amino acids, and salts are reabsorbed back into the blood by specific transporters in the renal tubule. The remaining components, i.e., excess water and waste products, are left behind in the renal tubule. Consequently, filtered blood exits the kidneys via renal veins and returns to the circulatory system. 5. Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in urine form: The remaining waste products and excess water in the renal tubule form urine. Urine is transported from the kidneys to the bladder through ureters. Once the bladder fills, urine is expelled from the body via the urethra during the process of urination. In conclusion, the process of kidney filtration and waste removal is an intricate and interconnected system within the human body. It is not affected by the presence or absence of lava in volcanic chambers. The perturbation of having no lava in the chambers does not have any direct or indirect influence on the kidney's ability to filter waste from the blood and remove excess water. Instead, the healthy functioning of the kidneys depends on various physiological factors, including blood pressure, water balance, and electrolyte levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 4: Analyze the relationship between the two statements: The premise suggests that analysts who lack proficiency in statistics should seek a statistician's help before selecting a method for analysis and using any results. It implies that statisticians can provide valuable support for non-expert analysts in these situations. The hypothesis states that statisticians are needed for the analysis of results and data sets, without specifying any conditions or qualifiers (e.g., whether the analyst is proficient in statistics). Step 5: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis: Considering the relationship between the two statements, we can infer that the premise partly entails the hypothesis. While the premise implies that statisticians are valuable for assisting non-expert analysts in the analysis of results and data sets, the hypothesis generalizes that statisticians are always needed when analyzing results and data sets, regardless of an analyst's proficiency in statistics. Thus, the premise entails the hypothesis to some extent but does not entirely support the broad claim in the hypothesis.

Remind yourself that straightening products and heat can cause damage. Wait patiently for your curls to grow out after a chemical relaxer. Article:","completion":"Caring for your hair can sometimes feel like caring for a precious plant. It needs the right attention and love to bloom beautifully! Let's explore some tips to nurture and grow our hair just right, specifically for folks with curly hair. First up, it's important to pick a hair superhero, you know, the person who helps tame your wild curls. This hero should know how to work with your type of hair. Just like we all have different favourite ice-cream flavours, everyone's hair behaves differently. Some people have soft curls, some have tough and some have looser waves! You need to find a hair superhero - a stylist, who understands your hair and knows how to take care of it best. Next is the 'hair wash' puzzle. You might feel like washing your hair every day makes it super clean. But that's like playing in the sandbox all day - it can tire your hair out! Instead, try not to wash your hair every day. This might seem a bit weird at first, like not brushing your teeth every day, but trust me, too much washing can actually make your hair sadder. While we're talking about washes, let's move on to conditioners. Have you ever seen what happens when you let a sponge soak in water? It takes all the water in! In the same way, using a hydrating conditioner and letting it soak in your hair is a thumbs-up move! It helps lock in moisture, leaving your hair happy and shiny. And when it comes to brushing your hair, remember to gently untangle it when it's wet using a comb. But don't yank or pull- that’s like pulling a kitten’s tail, mean and not good! Now, you might want to twist your curls or define their shape. This is where styling products come in. The trick is to apply them when your hair is still wet, like when you color a still wet painting to blend the colors beautifully! Try out different products, maybe it's a gel, mousse or cream. Don't worry if you have to test a few before finding your favorite. It's all a part of the hair adventure! Straight hair can be pretty at times, but be careful! Straightening products and heat often play the villain’s part. They can cause damage to your precious hair, just like how falling off a bike can give you cuts and scrapes. So, always remember that the straight look might not be worth the trouble it can cause. Lastly, if you've had your hair chemically relaxed and now you want your curls back, don't worry! Although it might seem like waiting for your birthday, your curls will grow back after a while. Be patient! Hair care isn't a race but a gentle journey, so enjoy each step. In the end, your hair will thank you with a gorgeous, glossy flourish!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, raspberries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums?

Text: Petitioner attempts to argue an absurd proposition, essentially that the State of Illinois is not part of the United States. His hope is that he will find some semantic technicality which will render him exempt from Federal income tax, which applies generally to all U.S. citizens and residents. Suffice it to say, we find no support in any of the authorities petitioner cites for his position that he is not subject to Federal income tax on income he earned in Illinois. Question: do you have to pay taxes in the united states?","completion":"Yes, you are generally required to pay taxes in the United States if you are a U.S. citizen, resident, or entity earning income within the country. The U.S. tax system is based on several key principles, including the obligation of citizens and residents to contribute financially to government functions through taxes. The petitioner's argument in the provided text, claiming that due to residing in the State of Illinois, he might be exempt from Federal income tax, is not valid or supported by any legal authorities. There are different types of taxes that individuals, businesses, and other entities must pay in the United States. These taxes are collected by various federal, state, and local government agencies and serve as the main source of income for these agencies to fund essential services and public goods. The primary types of taxes in the United States include: 1. Income Tax: This is levied on individuals, corporations, estates, and trusts in the United States. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal agency responsible for administering tax laws and collecting federal income taxes. U.S. citizens and residents are subject to federal income tax on their worldwide income regardless of where they live. Additionally, most states, including Illinois, impose a state income tax on their residents. 2. Payroll Tax: Employers and employees contribute to Social Security and Medicare through payroll taxes. These taxes are used to fund the Social Security program, which provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits, as well as the Medicare program, which provides health insurance for older adults and certain individuals with disabilities. Both the employer and the employee contribute an equal portion of these taxes based on the employee's earnings. 3. Sales Tax: This is a consumption-based tax imposed on the sale of goods and services and is collected at the point of sale, typically at the state and local government levels. Sales tax rates and the range of taxable items vary from state to state and even within local jurisdictions. 4. Property Tax: Property owners pay taxes on the value of their real estate and, in some cases, personal property (such as vehicles, boats, and airplanes). Property taxes are usually assessed and collected by local governments, like counties and municipalities, and fund local services, such as public education, infrastructure maintenance, and law enforcement. 5. Excise Tax: This is a tax levied on specific goods, services, and activities, such as gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol, and air travel. Excise taxes are imposed by federal, state, and local governments and are meant to discourage or penalize certain types of consumption or behavior, or raise revenue for specific purposes, such as highway construction. In conclusion, living in the United States and earning income within the country subjects individuals, businesses, and entities to various forms of taxation. The argument that a U.S. citizen living in Illinois—or any other state—might be exempt from federal income tax is not supported by legal or factual grounds. The U.S. tax system serves to fund important government services and functions, and all eligible taxpayers are required to pay their fair share."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It has long been said it's possible to die from a broken heart - and now scientists say the phenomenon can also be triggered by the shock of natural disasters. They have discovered the stress of hurricanes and earthquakes can trigger a condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Also known as broken heart syndrome, this is where the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened. Scientists have discovered that natural disasters such as tornadoes (the aftermath of the one that hit Joplin, Missouri, is pictured) can trigger a condition called broken heart syndrome. Researchers found that disaster areas such as Joplin - where this tornado struck in 2011 - had higher rates of the potentially fatal condition that year. It is often triggered. by extreme physical or emotional stress – for example, being in a car. accident or losing a child or spouse, say the U.S. researchers. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy got its name because the abnormal shape of. the heart resembles a Japanese octopus fishing pot (tako=octopus,. tsubo=pot). Previous research has linked broken heart syndrome to natural disasters, including. the 2004 earthquake in Japan. Now, scientists at the University of Arkansas have studied catastrophies in the U.S. They found dramatic spikes in cases of broken heart syndrome in two states after major natural disasters, suggesting the stress of disasters as a likely trigger. They identified 21,748 patients diagnosed with cases of broken heart syndrome in 2011 using a nationwide hospital discharge database. After mapping the cases by state, Vermont and Missouri emerged as having the highest rate of cases, with 380 cases per million residents in Vermont and 169 per million in Missouri. A distraught woman in Banda Aceh after the Asian tsunami in 2004. Researches say broken heart syndrome is triggered by stress and causes the heart muscle becomes temporarily enlarged and weakened. Most states had fewer than 150 cases per million residents. New Hampshire and Hawaii had the lowest rate of the disease that year. The rate of broken heart cases in Vermont in 2011 was more than double most other states. This was the same year that Tropical Storm Irene pummeled the state with heavy rain and wind, causing the most devastation Vermont has experienced since the Great Flood of 1927. Similarly, researchers found broken heart syndrome at a rate of 169 cases per million in Missouri in 2011, the same year a massive tornado ripped through the state's town of Joplin, demolishing neighborhoods and killing at least 158 people. 'Despite the seemingly increasing number of natural disasters we have, there is limited data about how it might affect the heart,' said Dr Sadip Pant, lead investigator of the study. Vermont, which fell victim to Hurricane Irene in the same year, also had one of the highest rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Image shows flood damage in Quechee, near White River Junction. 'Our findings suggest two disasters, one in Vermont and one in Missouri, might have been possible triggers for the clustering of takotsubo cardiomyopathy cases in these regions.' Patients with broken heart syndrome often complain of chest pain and shortness of breath, symptoms that mimic those of a heart attack, which can delay diagnosis. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke. Previous studies by the same group found that as many as one in four patients with broken heart syndrome have some form of arrhythmia and one to seven per cent suffer cardiac arrest. Many patients are diagnosed once doctors see there are no blockages in the artery, or imaging reveals changes in the shape of the heart that are characteristic of broken heart syndrome. Because natural disasters occur. more frequently in some parts of the country, residents in these regions. may have adapted to and experienced less stress during such. occurrences. A woman caught up in the 2003 Xinjiang earthquake, which destroyed the Chinese town. While broken heart syndrome typically resolves within a month or two, in the acute scenario it can result in serious complications such as heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias and stroke. However in places such as Vermont, where natural disasters are. relatively rare, people may be more susceptible to extreme stress when a. disaster hits particularly hard. 'By and large, it is a very reversible form of cardiomyopathy, but in the acute phase, these patients need to be monitored closely to be sure they are stable and to prevent and manage problems,' added Dr Pant. 'It's also something that emergency doctors and medical personnel need to be aware of as they are often on the frontlines seeing patients after disaster strikes. The authors add that different people's threshold for stress may also affect rates of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Gravestones tumbled over at cemetry at Jiganji temple in Ojiya, northern Japan after strong earthquakes in 2004. Rates of broken heart syndrome rose there shortly afterwards. Episodes are thought to be driven by the sympathetic response and surges of adrenaline in the body, similar to the well-known fight-or-flight reaction. This leads to depressed function of the apex and middle segment of the heart and increased contractility of the base producing a balloon-like appearance. 'It's a perfect example of our brain-heart connection,' said Dr Pant. 'The emotional stress we have in our brain can lead to responses in the heart, and not much is known about this condition.' The research was presented at the American. College of Cardiology's 63rd Annual Scientific Session.","completion":"Scientists have found that the stress of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes can trigger a condition called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Rivers flowing over gentle slopes move more slowly. They move much more slowly than a mountain stream. These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake.

Choose from: --no; --yes;","completion":"--no; In the text, it says that rivers flowing over gentle slopes move more slowly than mountain streams.

A. air port B. repair shop C. road D. race track E. freeway The best answer is","completion":"The best answer to where a car belongs depends on the context and the purpose for which the car is being used. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various situations, we can examine each choice in-depth: A. Airport - Cars are relevant at airports as they serve transport purposes for passengers, airport personnel, and rented vehicles. However, an airport is not the primary place where cars belong since it is an area designed for airplanes and air travel. B. Repair Shop - A car would be in a repair shop if it requires maintenance or repair after an accident or due to malfunction. In this context, it may 'belong' in the repair shop temporarily, but this setting doesn't generally represent where cars are primarily used or found. C. Road - The most appropriate answer is the road. Cars are specifically designed to travel on roads, which comprise the backbone of transportation infrastructure in most countries. Roads are an extensive network where people use cars and other vehicles for various purposes like commuting to work, running errands, going on vacations, and more. Consequently, the road is the primary place where cars belong. D. Race Track - If the car in question is a racing or sports car constructed for the purpose of competing in races or driving at high speeds, it might 'belong' on a race track. However, race tracks are specialized environments for specific types of cars, and many cars are not designed or meant for this purpose. Thus, while a race track may be suitable for some cars, it doesn't represent the best fit for most cars. E. Freeway - Similar to roads, freeways facilitate the movement of cars and other vehicles for long-distance travels or bypassing congested city streets. While a freeway is a suitable place for cars to be driven, it is not inherently better or more appropriate than other types of roads, such as city streets or rural roads. In conclusion, the best answer to where a car belongs is C. Road. Roads are the primary environment for which cars have been designed, and they accommodate numerous car-centered activities like commuting, running errands, and connecting cities, towns, and rural areas. While other options like airports, repair shops, race tracks, and freeways are valid in specific contexts, the most comprehensive and universally applicable answer is the road."},{"prompt":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when does the electoral college votes Suggested answer: There are 538 electors, based on there being 435 representatives and 100 senators, plus the three electors from the District of Columbia.

He studied under Azerbaijan's Founder of Composed Music, Uzeyir Hajibeyov and under Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Uzeyir Hajibeyov composed music all across Europe.","completion":"It is difficult to determine whether the statement \\"Uzeyir Hajibeyov composed music all across Europe\\" follows directly from the given text, as there is no mention of Hajibeyov's activities in Europe. However, the text does provide us with some relevant information about Hajibeyov and his connection to Ahmad Jovdat Ismayil oglu Hajiyev. Uzeyir Hajibeyov is mentioned as Azerbaijan's Founder of Composed Music and a teacher of Ahmad Jovdat Hajiyev. He is therefore an important figure in Azerbaijani music history and likely an influential mentor to Hajiyev. Furthermore, since Hajiyev went on to become a major composer in the Soviet period, this suggests that Hajibeyov's teachings and influence reached beyond Azerbaijan and were impactful on a broader scale. Considering the prominence of Uzeyir Hajibeyov as a founder of composed music in Azerbaijan, it is plausible that he may have traveled and worked across Europe and contributed to the music culture there. However, the given text does not provide concrete evidence of Hajibeyov's activities in Europe. Therefore, while the statement about Hajibeyov composing music across Europe may be possible, it neither directly follows nor contradicts the information provided in the text. To confirm the accuracy of the statement, more research would be necessary to establish connections between Hajibeyov's work and his presence or influence in Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dame Helen Lydia Mirren, (nee Mironoff; born 26 July 1945) is an English actor. Mirren began her acting career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, and is one of the few performers who have achieved the Triple Crown of Acting. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 2007 for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen and received the Olivier Award for Best Actress and Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the same role in The Audience. Mirren's other Academy Award nominations include The Madness of King George (1994), Gosford Park (2001) and The Last Station (2009). Mirren's first film of the 2000s was Joel Hershman's Greenfingers (2000), a comedy based on the true story about the award-winning prisoners of HMP Leyhill, a minimum-security prison. Mirren portrayed a devoted plantswoman in the film, who coaches a team of prison gardeners, led by Clive Owen, to victory at a prestigious flower show. The project garnered largely lukewarm reviews from critics, who felt that it added \\"nothing new to this already saturated genre\\" of British feel-good films. The same year, she began work on the mystery film The Pledge, actor Sean Penn's second directorial effort, in which she played a child psychologist. A critical success, the ensemble film tanked at the box office. Also the year, she filmed the American-Icelandic satirical drama No Such Thing opposite Sarah Polley. Directed by Hal Hartley, Mirren portrayed a soulless television producer in the film, who strives for sensationalistic stories. It was largely panned by critics. Her biggest critical and commercial success, released in 2001, became Robert Altman's all-star ensemble mystery film Gosford Park. An homage to writer Agatha Christie's whodunit style, the story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American, and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at an English country house, resulting in an unexpected murder. Widely acclaimed by critics, it received multiple awards and nominations, including a second Academy Award nomination and first Screen Actors Guild Award win for Mirren's portrayal of the sternly devoted head servant Mrs. Wilson. Mirren's last film that year was Fred Schepisi's dramedy film Last Orders opposite Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins. In 2003, Mirren starred in Nigel Cole's comedy Calendar Girls, inspired by the true story of a group of Yorkshire women who produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research under the auspices of the Women's Institutes. Mirren was initially resistant to join the project, at first dismissing it as another middling British picture, but rethought her decision upon learning of the casting of co-star Julie Walters. The film garnered generally positive reactions by film critics, and grossed 96,000,000 worldwide. In addition, the picture earned Satellite, Golden Globe, and European Film Award nominations for Mirren. Her other film that year was the Showtime television film The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone opposite Olivier Martinez, and Anne Bancroft, based on the 1950 novel of the same title by Tennessee Williams.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such","completion":"The sentiment of this movie review sentence is overwhelmingly negative. Here is an in-depth analysis of the sentiment: The reviewer starts off their statement with \\"it's so poorly made,\\" which is immediately setting the tone as critical and negative. When the reviewer suggests that the movie is \\"poorly made,\\" they are implying that the film's quality on a technical level - including elements such as directing, cinematography, sound design, and possibly acting - is below standard or expectation. This indicates a dissatisfaction and disapproval of the film's production value. The next part of the sentence, \\"on all levels,\\" amplifies the negativity of the sentiment by emphasizing that there's not a single area where the movie excels or even meets the standard level. This could potentially encompass elements like the plot, dialogue, character development, creativity, execution, special effects, costume and set design, etc. 'On all levels' acts as a sweeping condemnation of the movie, indicating that there are no redeeming qualities to be found. The criticism culminates in the last part of this review with \\"that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such.\\" The sentiment here escalates from negative to dismissive. A spoof is generally regarded as a comedic imitative work, often exaggerated for humorous effect. The reviewer indicates that the movie is so poorly done that it cannot even be considered a successful exaggerated imitation or mockery of its genre. This dismissal suggests a profound disappointment and a hint of derision. In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is unambiguously negative. The reviewer not only criticizes the film's technical aspects and general quality, but further devalues it as not even worth spoof status. This comprehensive negative sentiment indicates a strong dissatisfaction with the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question: What is the purpose of drinking water? Here are possible answers to this question: - swallow - headaches - hydration - hunger - vomiting I believe the correct choice is \\"hydration\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Hydration, and here's why: Water is essential for life, and drinking water serves multiple purposes that are crucial for the proper functioning and well-being of the human body. Among the list of possible answers, \\"hydration\\" stands out as the most accurate and significant answer. Let's explore why hydration is the correct choice and examine the other options provided. 1. Hydration: Water is the primary component of our body, accounting for approximately 60% of an adult's overall body weight. Staying hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water daily is fundamental for maintaining good health. Proper hydration ensures that our body can perform various vital functions, such as: - Regulating body temperature - Lubricating joints - Aiding digestion and nutrient absorption - Improving blood circulation and oxygen delivery to cells - Supporting the kidneys in flushing out waste products and toxins - Maintaining appropriate electrolyte balance - Ensuring optimal cognitive function, mood stability, and physical performance 2. Swallow: While it is true that drinking water can help in swallowing by moistening food in the mouth and facilitating its passage down the esophagus, this is a comparatively minor aspect of water consumption. Although this function aids in the digestion process, it doesn't encompass the full spectrum of benefits that result from maintaining proper hydration. 3. Headaches: Dehydration can be a common cause of headaches and migraines. Drinking enough water helps prevent and alleviate headaches associated with dehydration. Nonetheless, this is just one of the many consequences of not maintaining adequate hydration and, as such, cannot be considered the primary purpose of drinking water. 4. Hunger: It is known that thirst can sometimes be mistaken for hunger, and drinking water can help curb the sensation of hunger. In some cases, staying hydrated can help control appetite and prevent overeating. However, quenching hunger is not the primary goal of consuming water, but rather a side effect of ensuring that our bodies are correctly hydrated. 5. Vomiting: Drinking water can help replenish fluids lost during vomiting and prevent dehydration. However, the purpose of drinking water goes beyond addressing symptoms like vomiting. It's essential for maintaining overall body health and balance, not just recovering from specific issues. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"hydration\\" is undoubtedly the correct answer when addressing the primary purpose of drinking water. Hydration is essential for the healthy functioning of our bodies and plays a key role in supporting various critical processes. While the other options provided may relate to specific instances where water intake is important, they do not fully encompass the overarching importance of hydration in maintaining good health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the two facts above, where do plants that grow in hot, dry deserts store water?","completion":"Given the two facts mentioned, plants that grow in hot, dry deserts, such as cactus species, have developed specialized structures and adaptations to store water in order to survive the harsh environmental conditions they encounter. The primary location for water storage in these plants is within their stems. Fact 1 states that a cactus stem is used for storing water. Indeed, many cactus species, such as the saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), have a special type of stem known as a succulent stem. This stem is fleshy, thickened, and can store significant amounts of water for extended periods. This allows cactus plants to survive long droughts and efficiently use the scarce water resources available in hot, arid environments. The succulent stem in cacti can expand and contract depending on the water content inside it. When the cactus absorbs water, the stem swells, and when water is scarce, the stem contracts to preserve its stored water. This storage capacity assists the cactus in sustaining its metabolic processes during periods when water is less accessible. Additionally, many desert plants have developed other adaptations that help them not only store water but also reduce water loss. For example, some cacti have evolved to carry out photosynthesis at night (a process called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or CAM photosynthesis), which limits the amount of water lost during this process. Another adaptation is that most cacti have small or absent leaves, which helps minimize water loss via transpiration. In conclusion, plants that grow in hot, dry deserts, such as various cactus species, primarily store water within their specialized stem structures called succulent stems. These stems allow the plants to retain water efficiently and survive in the challenging desert environment."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Turkana are a Nilotic people native to the Turkana District in northwest Kenya, a semi-arid climate region bordering Lake Turkana in the east, Pokot, Rendille and Samburu people to the south, Uganda to the west, and South Sudan and Ethiopia to the north. They refer to their land as Turkan. According to the 2009 Kenyan census, Turkana number 855,399, or 2.5% of the Kenyan population, making the Turkana the third largest Nilotic ethnic group in Kenya, after the Kalenjin and the Luo, slightly more numerous than the Maasai, and the tenth largest ethnicity in all of Kenya. Although this figure was initially controversial and rejected as too large by Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya, a court ruling (Feb 7, 2012) by Justice Mohammed Warsame (judge) stated that the Kenyan government accepts the 2009 census figures for Turkana. Traditionally, both men and women wear wraps made of rectangular woven materials and animal skins. Today, these cloths are normally purchased, having been manufactured in Nairobi or elsewhere in Kenya. Often, men wear their wraps similar to tunics, with one end connected with the other end over the right shoulder, and carry wrist knives made of steel and goat hide. Men also carry stools (known as ekicholong) and will use these for simple chairs rather than sitting on the hot midday sand. These stools also double as headrests, keeping one's head elevated from the sand, and protecting any ceremonial head decorations from being damaged. It is also not uncommon for men to carry several staves; one is used for walking and balance when carrying loads; the other, usually slimmer and longer, is used to prod livestock during herding activities. Women will customarily wear necklaces, and will shave their hair completely which often has beads attached to the loose ends of hair. Men wear their hair shaved. Women wear two pieces of cloth, one being wrapped around the waist while the other covers the top. Traditionally leather wraps covered with ostrich egg shell beads were the norm for women's undergarments, though these are now uncommon in many areas. The Turkana people have elaborate clothing and adornment styles. Clothing is used to distinguish between age groups, development stages, occasions and status of individuals or groups in the Turkana community. Today, many Turkana have adopted western-style clothing. This is especially prominent among both men and women who live in town centers throughout Turkana. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Sure, kiddo! Imagine you and your friends are playing a fun game of pretend pirates.

The dog had a little tummy trouble and, oops, it had an accident right in the aisle of the plane where people walk! Everyone was shocked, and the airplane workers quickly cleaned up the mess. But uh-oh, they ran out of toilet paper while cleaning it up! The big dog still wasn't feeling well and had another accident in the aisle later on. The airplane workers decided that the plane needed to land in Kansas City, Missouri, so they could clean up properly and make sure everything was all shiny and clean again before they could continue the trip. And so, the plane took a little detour to Kansas City, where it landed, and the nice cleaning crews came on board to clean and make the airplane smell fresh and nice again. After that, the plane took off and continued its journey, finally reaching Philadelphia, where all the passengers could go to their homes or visit their friends and family. The dog's owner felt very sorry and apologetic to everyone on the plane. She wanted to make sure they knew she was sorry and told the passengers she wanted to give them all gifts.

In the first sentence, \\"Illnesses associated with this genus include,\\" the term \\"illnesses\\" is used, whereas in the second sentence, \\"Diseases associated with this genus include,\\" the term \\"diseases\\" is used. Although \\"illnesses\\" and \\"diseases\\" are often used interchangeably, they can imply slightly different things. In medical terms, a disease refers to a pathological condition affecting a body part or whole organism, while an illness refers to a person's subjective experience of their symptoms and impaired functioning. 2. For DCV, the first sentence describes \\"increased reproductive potential, extremely high when associated with pathogenic injected mortality.\\" This statement suggests that the disease leads to a higher reproductive rate and that this phenomenon becomes even more prevalent when paired with a high level of injected mortality resulting from the pathogen. This phrasing presents a conditional relationship between the increased reproductive potential and the pathogenic injected mortality. On the other hand, the second sentence characterizes DCV as having an \\"increased reproduction potential, extremely pathogenic when injected with high associated mortality.\\" Here, DCV is described as highly pathogenic when it's injected and associated with high mortality. This description emphasizes the pathogenic nature of DCV when injected instead of discussing a conditional relationship between the reproductive potential and mortality. 3. For CrPV, both sentences describe the same effects: paralysis and death. There is no difference in their description of CrPV.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Yet again, politics and race got mixed up together today, and this time with an added bonus -- adoption. In a segment on her MSNBC show, host Melissa Harris-Perry highlighted Mitt Romney's family photo, in which the former GOP presidential candidate held his newly adopted African-American grandson on his knee. She encouraged her panel to \\"caption that\\" picture. What followed was unfortunate, thoughtless commentary from the panel. (One of the panelists, Dean Obeidallah, appears on CNN shows and writes op-eds for CNN.com.) The exchange was a cold reminder of us of just how easy it is to flippantly do harm, and also of the dearth of understanding and sensitivity surrounding race and adoption. I am a transracial adoptee and advocate for children and families, so the complexities of race and adoption resonate on a personal level. I see myself in that Romney family photo. I was adopted from foster care when I was about 8 months old. My white parents recall that during the adoption process, there was little conversation about race or what it meant to have a baby of another race enter the family. The \\"non-identifying\\" adoption records I received as an adult articulated the agency's noncommittal stance on my race and noted that there was a birthmark present that \\"could indicate\\" I was of mixed race. With the reality that race was not something that was going to be discussed, how could anyone expect me or my family to know how to deal with issues of race and adoption? There was little to no education, so we were left to our own devices. When people did and said insensitive and cruel things, my sturdy New England parents simply loved me and cared for me the very best they could. According to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, about 40% of adoptions in America are transracial (most are international adoptions) and that number is growing. Most transracial adoptions are with white adoptive parents. While there is a strong sense of community support surrounding many intercountry adoptions -- such as from South Korea and China -- black and white adoptions tends to be more polarizing. Thankfully, more resources are available today than during my 1971 adoption. Families can proactively seek out books, online help and support groups to be more in tune with the needs of their adopted children. But they have to be self-starters because transracial adoption is poorly studied and not tracked appropriately. What's lacking are longitudinal studies that focus on the transracial adoption experience. Without these, it's difficult to create and target additional programs and support systems, indeed to even make the case that they are needed. While to many, research that would yield such information would be useful and important, it seems to fall low on the funding priority list. Because of this, available data is old, limited and often inconsistent. This might also have something to do with issues of class, race and history that for many attend the idea of white parents adopting black and brown babies. Today there is no set national standard for training pre-adoptive parents that want to adopt a child of another race. Some agencies make it their mission to do as much as they can to prepare families, while others simply do not include differences in race and what that means to a family as part of their training. Against this backdrop, the misbegotten MSNBC jokes hurt. They don't help. They are another reminder that adoptive families need to be always at the ready to support their children on matters of race and adoption. White parents will never fully understand what it means to be black or brown, but they can and should do their best to support their children. And they should have help: Even the best adoptions managed by well-trained practitioners should offer robust post-adoption services and education that includes the language and tools to help adopted children as they grow and develop. When someone says or does something careless, the people that should know how to comfort the adopted person should not be at a loss. I remember in my white neighborhood that people during the summer would ask me if I was a \\"fresh air\\" child. While I did not understand it, I got the distinct impression that I did not belong where I was for some strange reason. And kids in my school would throw out barbs such as \\"at least I know who my real parents are.\\" So often, the thoughtlessness and carelessness of others results in deep pain for adoptees, who are already faced with navigating a life-ong search for identity that begins with losing their original family. I can't help but feel for innocent little Kieran Romney as he is singled out at the very beginning of his adoption journey. When transracial adoption is mocked, it only works to undermine the foundation adoptees and adoptive families are trying to build. One hopes Kieran's parents received guidance before adopting him on the challenges they could face. Insensitivity, ignorance and intolerance will fuel negative comments. The answer is to better to prepare and educate adoptive parents, practitioners, educators and the media to the sensitivities of adoption and race. Transracially adoption children should be protected and empowered, not singled out and mocked. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of April Dinwoodie.

In situations where people say mean and hurtful things when they are angry, it is important to understand that anger can cloud a person's judgment and lead them to communicate in ways they otherwise wouldn't. While it is possible that some individuals may mean what they say, it is also likely that the person's anger motivates their hurtful words. The person may be expressing their frustration or annoyance, and their words may not accurately represent their true feelings or beliefs about you. It's crucial to remember that understanding the context of the situation and recognizing that anger-driven words may not always be genuine helps to better navigate conflicts and maintain healthy relationships. Question 2: How can I think before speaking and not say things to hurt people? In order to think before speaking and avoid saying hurtful things, you can try the following strategies: 1. Take a deep breath: When emotions are running high, taking a deep breath can help you to slow down and calm yourself before responding. This is particularly useful if you're feeling angry or upset, as it helps to create a moment of pause before speaking. 2. Practice active listening: Focus on truly understanding what the other person is saying. By concentrating on the other person, your own thoughts and emotions, and how you want to respond, you're more likely to consider the impact of your words before speaking. 3. Consider the impact: Always think about how your words might affect the person you're speaking to. Try empathizing with their situation and considering how you would feel if someone said the same thing to you. This may help you choose a more compassionate and thoughtful response. 4. Choose your words carefully: Before speaking, try to reflect on the best way to phrase your thoughts to minimize the potential for misunderstanding or hurt feelings. This might mean using \\"I\\" statements (e.g., \\"I feel frustrated when…\\") instead of placing blame (e.g., \\"You're being inconsiderate\\"), or perhaps asking more probing questions to clarify their feelings and perceptions. 5. Take a step back: If you're struggling to remain composed or find the right words, consider taking a break from the conversation. This allows you to collect your thoughts, regain your emotional balance, and return with a clear mind and a fresh perspective. To answer your final question, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 addresses the intention behind hurtful or mean words when someone is angry, while Question 2 focuses on strategies for speaking thoughtfully and avoiding causing harm through communication. Although both questions involve communication and interpersonal relationships, their main concerns are distinct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: It is obvious that television brings us not only advantages but also disadvantages . At first, television is both a convenient channel of amusement, and a ly cheap one. If we have a TV set in the family, we are not necessary to go to the cinema or theatre to enjoy programme with expensive tickets. All that they have to do is press a button with a finger, and they can watch all the programmes they like, such as TV talk shows , movies, opera and so on. But some people think of it as a danger. When we watch TV, we don't need to do anything . We do not even have to leave our sofa because we have a remote control in our hand. We don't need to make any judgment or statement about it. We are totally passive and don't use our head to think hard about some matters. As we all know, television keeps us informed about world events--including all the events in society, science and politics .We can get a good idea of the most remote countries and the strangest customs in their country. Of course the radio performs this service too, but the effect of the programme is not better than on the television. Everything we enjoy on the television is much more vivid and realistic. However, in turn there is a great danger. Usually we cannot resist the television screen, because it has a great harm for us. We have been so accustomed to enjoying the screen, so dependent on its pictures. But when our TV sets are out of order, we are surprised to find that we have much more time to do things. And at this time we actually begin to have a talk to each other again. It is really worth thinking. Of course the arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of television are on the go.We can not simply say television itself is good or bad. The truth is that how we use it determines its true value to our society. Question: Why are some people against TV? Options: A: Because TV programs are not interesting. B: Because TV viewers are completely passive. C: Because TV prices are very high. D: Because TV has both advantages and disadvantages. Answer:","completion":"B: Because TV viewers are completely passive. In the article, it is mentioned that some people consider television as a danger because when watching TV, viewers do not need to actively engage or think.

As she goes to pass, her car is clipped by a truck going in the opposite direction, then slammed full-force by the Mack, killing her. Meanwhile, John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise witness their young son Michael collapse at his baseball game and take Michael to the hospital. After a series of tests at the hospital, John is informed by Dr. Raymond Turner and Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, that his son has an enlarged heart and will need a heart transplant to live. The procedure is very expensive: 250,000 (at a minimum), with a down payment of 75,000 (30%) required to get Michael's name on the organ donor list. John tells them he is insured, but after looking through his policy, they tell him that because the company he works for dropped John from full-time to part-time, his health insurance has been changed, and the new policy does not cover the surgery, which leaves John and Denise to raise 75,000 on their own. The family tries to raise the money but are only able to come up with a third of the necessary payment. The hospital tires of waiting and releases Michael; Denise urges John to do something. Unwilling to let his child die, John walks into the hospital ER with a handgun, gathers eleven hostages, and sets demands: his son's name on the recipient list as soon as possible.

Avoid wearing casual clothing, like jeans, t-shirts, or sneakers. 3. Address the judge correctly: When speaking to the judge, address them as \\"Your Honor\\" or \\"Judge [Last Name].\\" This demonstrates respect and acknowledges their role in the courtroom. Never call the judge by their first name or use informal language. 4. Follow courtroom decorum: Make sure to observe the specific rules and protocols of the courtroom. This includes turning off or silencing your cell phone, refraining from eating or drinking (unless permitted), not talking out of turn, and avoiding disruptive behaviors. Be attentive and listen carefully to the proceedings. 5. Wait for your turn to speak: Never interrupt the judge, opposing counsel, or witnesses. Allow each person to finish their statement or testimony before interjecting. If you're representing yourself, wait for the judge to grant you permission to speak, pose questions, or present evidence. 6. Be polite and respectful: Maintaining a respectful, calm, and courteous demeanor throughout the court proceedings is essential. When speaking, be concise, clear, and professional. Never argue with or disrespect the judge. If you have a disagreement or objection, follow the appropriate legal channels and protocols to express it. 7. Follow instructions from court staff: Ensure you follow any instructions given by the judge, bailiff, or court clerk promptly and without complaint. This includes providing relevant documents, moving to specific areas of the courtroom when asked, and adhering to any time limits for presentations or testimony. 8. Sit when instructed: Once the judge has entered the room and everyone has risen, wait for the instruction to sit down. Make sure you sit calmly and quietly, without causing a disturbance or slouching in your seat. This also applies when it's time to leave the courtroom; rise when the judge leaves the room, and wait for instruction to exit. By following these guidelines and maintaining a respectful attitude, you will be able to effectively honor a judge in court and exhibit professionalism during legal proceedings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the final album to feature original keyboardist Eric Stefani, who left the band in 1994. The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and recorded in 11 studios in the Greater Los Angeles Area between March 1993 and October 1995. Between 1995 and 1998, seven singles were released from it, including \\"Just a Girl\\", which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart; and \\"Don't Speak\\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and reached the top five of many international charts. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. It has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. Tragic Kingdom helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them to attract more mainstream attention. The album was ranked number 441 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. No Doubt embarked on a tour to promote the album.

Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - In October 1829, the bodies of Ezra and Robert Wright, owners of the two-masted Lake Serpent, washed ashore in Lorain County, according to newspaper reports at the time. Their corpses confirmed what had been suspected for a week - that the schooner had gone down in a storm after leaving Put-in-Bay, bound for Cleveland with a load of stone. But as the pirate legend says, dead men tell no tales, so no one really knew where the ship had gone down . . . or what happened to the other two crew members. At least part of that mystery apparently has been solved. Tom Kowalczk, a veteran Lake Erie wreck diver and searcher who is director of remote sensing for the nonprofit Cleveland Underwater Explorers (CLUE), was searching east of Kelley's Island in July 2015 and found what the \\"Discovery Report'' describes as \\"a small, barely noticeable anomaly.'' The exact location of the wreck is a closely guarded secret in order to preserve the site and keep curiosity seekers or untrained would-be archaeologists from disturbing it. If it is, in fact, the Lake Serpent, it will be the oldest shipwreck yet found in Erie, said marine archaeologist Carrie Sowden, director of archaeology for the Toledo-based National Museum of the Great Lakes, who will oversee the underwater excavation of the site this summer. Confirmation that the wreck actually is the Lake Serpent could come fairly quickly once divers, who likely will work off Kowalczk's boat, begin their excavation in July. \\"If it is the Lake Serpent, there should be a figurehead under the bowsprit,'' said Sowden in a telephone interview. The actual coordinates of the site remain known only to Sowden and her teammates with the museum and with CLUE. \\"There are two other possibilities,'' said Sowden, asked how confident researchers are that the ship is the 47-foot Lake Serpent. The Discovery Report lists the Fair Play and the Victor, two similarly sized ships that were lost in Lake Erie, the location of their remains still a mystery. \\"If it is the Lake Serpent, great,'' said Sowden. \\"If it isn't, can we confirm the identity of one of the two we think it could be.'' As soon as its identity is sure, Sowden will lead the charge in getting the state of Ohio to nominate it to the National Register of Historic Places. It may seem ghoulish, but the question has to be asked: We know what happened to the Wright brothers. What of the other two sailors? Could their bodies be aboard what's left of the Lake Serpent? \\"We're not planning on finding any [remains],'' Sowden said. \\"Lake Erie is cold, but after 189 years, I don't expect there to be any organic material left, if there were bodies.'' Even if the other crew members did not get off the boat, and went to their deaths trapped in the boat, Sowden's team doesn't expect to excavate enough to find anything. The focus is going to be uncovering that figurehead on the bowsprit and confirming that the wreck is, indeed, the Lake Serpent, then dig along the port side of the ship \\"to get a clean deck level.'' But what if the excavators find evidence of human remains? \\"If we find anything related to that, we stop instantly,'' she said. \\"There is no more work. You stop and call the coroner from that county.'' The excavation will be a painstaking, careful process in about 40 or 50 feet of water, overseen by Sowden and involving only four or five trained volunteer divers. \\"You're not vacuuming,'' Sowden said. \\"There's a 2-inch trash pump that sits on the surface, and you run a fireman's hose to the dredge head. \\"As water comes in, it creates suction on the other end, and you put a catch bag on, just in case there's anything in there,'' she said. \\"It's kind of like sifting the sediment through the intake. You're not blindly pulling up stuff, so if there's a big nail, you can feel it in your fingers as you're feeding it into the tube.'' Sowden is convinced that researchers will be able to tell within the first two days whether the wreck is the Lake Serpent or the Fair Play or Victor, the other two possible wrecks out of 800 to 1,000 vessels currently resting in the depths of Lake Erie. The excavation is set for mid- to late July, said Sowden. The project is expected to take 10 days, at a cost of about 13,000. The museum already has raised almost half that goal, and has set up an indiegogo.com online fundraiser to acquire the rest.

It's not like there's a big rush, anyway. The ship has been on the bottom almost 189 years. It's not going to pull up anchor and sail away now, anyway. ||||| TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Shipwreck hunters are planning to excavate around a Lake Erie wreck this summer that they think could be the remains of a schooner that went down nearly two centuries ago. Its size, design and location point toward it being a sailing ship called the Lake Serpent, which sunk in 1829, the National Museum of the Great Lakes said Monday. That would make it one of the oldest wrecks ever discovered on Lake Erie. The shallowest of the Great Lakes where violent storms whip up in a hurry is home to hundreds of wreckage sites. Many have been found in recent years by a small, dedicated band of hunters. To determine whether the latest discovery to be announced is indeed the Lake Serpent, divers will first need to get a closer look at wreckage and move away the sediment covering part of the ship. \\"Because it's so small, that makes it very, very old,\\" said Tom Kowalczk, who spotted the wreckage on his sonar screen in the summer of 2015. \\"That puts it way back to an early time frame and really limits the possibilities.\\" Members of the Cleveland Underwater Explorers and the museum have been digging through historical records and newspaper clippings to come up with the names of vessels it might be. They've narrowed the list to three, with the Lake Serpent being the most likely answer, said Carrie Snowden, the museum's archaeology director. \\"That's our working theory,\\" she said. The schooner was built in 1821 in Cleveland at a time when the city had less than 1,000 residents. Its job was to carry cargo — produce, flour, whiskey, limestone — to ports along the lakes. It went down eight years later with a load of stone and a small crew near Kelleys Island off the Ohio shoreline. The body of one crew member was spotted in the lake days later while the bodies of the captain and his brother washed up on the shore of Lorain County in the fall of 1829, according to a newspaper report. The ship had an unusual carving of a serpent's head in the bow. The museum is raising money so that divers this summer can remove the sediment that surrounds the bow to see if they can find the serpent's head. They also plan to take measurements, examine how the ship was constructed and look for any artifacts that could identify the ship as the Lake Serpent. \\"If it isn't that,\\" said Snowden. \\"We just have to keep digging some more.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A wreck found in Lake Erie off the coast of Ohio may be the remains of the Lake Serpent, a schooner that is believed to have sunk in a storm in 1829.

What are some of the most weird rules of X country?","completion":"No, these questions have different meanings and focus on different aspects of a country's rules for visitors. The first question, \\"Which country has strict rules for its visitors?\\", asks the reader to provide information on a country that is known for having stringent regulations for people who visit. This question directs attention to the strictness of the rules a particular country imposes on visitors in terms of entry requirements, documentation, or even behavior while in the country. An answer to this question would likely focus on a specific country, or a list of countries, known for having particularly strict rules for travelers. For example, some countries with strict rules for its visitors would include North Korea, Saudi Arabia, or Bhutan. These countries may have limitations on visas, registration processes, or require visitors to have a guided tour. On the other hand, the second question, \\"What are some of the most weird rules of X country?\\", seeks to identify unusual or strange rules that exist in a specific country. This question is more focused on peculiar regulations that may be seen as bizarre or unexpected to foreigners visiting the country, rather than on the strictness of the rules themselves. An answer to this question would typically outline a number of unusual rules and provide a short explanation or reasoning behind them. For instance, some weird rules in various countries could include: 1. Singapore: Chewing gum is banned due to the government's efforts to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in public spaces. 2. Iceland: In many parts of the country, it is illegal to own pet snakes, lizards, and turtles because of their potential impact on the delicate ecosystem. 3. Venice, Italy: Feeding pigeons is prohibited to preserve the city's historic buildings and monuments from pigeon droppings damage. In summary, the first question seeks to identify countries that have strict regulations for visitors in terms of entry and travel requirements, while the second question aims to uncover specific unusual or bizarre rules within a given country. The primary difference between the two questions lies in the focus on the strictness of rules for the first question, and the peculiarity of the rules for the second question."},{"prompt":"As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School.

In a courtroom packed with journalists and spectators in Bozeman, Montana, Gianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault, saying, “Although it was not my intention to hurt him, I understand Ben was injured.” After judge Rick West repeatedly asked Gianforte whether he believed he caused injury to Jacobs, the congressman-elect said he did. West initially said he would sentence him to four days in jail, saying he could do a work program as an alternative to spending those nights in jail. But when the judge learned that the assault charge was not eligible for the program, he decided to instead sentence him to 40 hours of community service, emphasizing that he did not want the congressman-elect to go to jail. “You accepted responsibility. You apologized,” said West, who noted the Republican tech millionaire’s business accomplishments in his sentencing. The judge also said he did not believe the maximum fine of 500 was necessary. 'This needs to stop': Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs' statement to court Read more In his statement to the court, Jacobs recounted the violent encounter and aftermath: “I asked Mr Gianforte a question in the same manner I have asked questions of hundreds of politicians: congressmen, senators and even the man who is now our president. Mr Gianforte’s response was to slam me to the floor and start punching me. He injured my elbow, broke my glasses and thrust me into a national spotlight I did not seek or desire.” Gianforte arrived to court with his wife Susan earlier Monday morning and rushed past photographers and reporters, ignoring their questions. The sentencing comes a week after Gianforte reached a settlement with Jacobs in which the Republican apologised to the reporter and agreed to pay 50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In a letter to Jacobs, Gianforte wrote his “physical response” to the Guardian reporter’s “legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable, and unlawful”. “I made a mistake and humbly ask for your forgiveness,” he added. Gianforte was charged with assault just hours before voting began in the 25 May special election to fill Montana’s sole House of Representatives seat, which was vacated by Ryan Zinke after he was appointed president Donald Trump’s secretary of the interior. When Jacobs approached the then-candidate at his campaign headquarters in Bozeman to ask a question about the Republican health care bill, Gianforte reacted by throwing the reporter to the ground and punching him. Jacobs captured audio of the altercation, and his account was corroborated by a team of Fox News reporters who were in the room. Jacobs’ glasses were broken during the assault. Play Video 0:41 Republican Greg Gianforte 'body slams' Guardian reporter in Montana – audio “Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him,” Fox News reporter Alicia Alcuna wrote in a first-hand account. “Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter.” Gianforte was charged later that night, and Montana’s three largest newspapers quickly withdrew their endorsements of the Republicans. However, the Republican was elected the following day, drawing just over 50% of the vote against Democrat and folk-singer Rob Quist. More than two-thirds of the votes had been cast by mail before the attack on Jacobs occurred. The Gianforte campaign initially blamed Jacobs for the incident, issuing a statement that falsely claimed the reporter “grabbed Greg’s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground”. “It’s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,” campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon said in the statement. Though Gianforte apologized for his actions at his election night victory party, the congressman-elect did not address his campaign’s false statement about the incident until reaching last week’s civil settlement. “Notwithstanding anyone’s statements to the contrary, you did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you,” he wrote in the letter. “I am sorry for what I did and the unwanted notoriety this created for you.” In his court statement on Monday, Gianforte initially declined to admit that he directly caused Jacobs injuries, saying: “In the scuffle, we fell to the floor, and I understand his elbow was injured.” When the judge asked if he caused injury, Gianforte replied: “I understand bodily injury resulted.” Pressed on the question, Gianforte eventually admitted that he was the cause of Jacobs’ injuries. For his part, Jacobs noted in court that Gianforte “lied in a defamatory public statement”, but said he now expects Gianforte to be a “strong advocate for a free press and for the first amendment” in Congress. He said he hopes he gets an opportunity to interview him. The reporter also noted that the incident has “had national ramifications on our politics and our culture,” adding, “While I have no doubt that actions like these were an aberration for Congressman-elect Gianforte personally, I worry that, in the context of our political debate, they have become increasingly common. In recent years, our discourse has grown increasingly rancorous and increasingly vile. This needs to stop.” Jacobs continued: “There will always be fundamental political disagreements in our society. However, these need not become personal and certainly should never become violent. I hope this court’s decision can send a strong message about the necessity of civil discourse and the important role of the free press and to help heal our political system.” At the end of the hearing, Gianforte addressed Jacobs directly, saying: “I just want to say I’m sorry, and if and when you’re ready, I look forward to sitting down with you.” However, outside the courtroom following the hearing Gianforte ignored most reporters’ questions, including journalists who asked about Jacobs’ original health care question and another reporter who asked why his campaign initially lied about the assault. Gianforte, his wife and Scanlon rushed into a car waiting outside for them as a protester with a “Lock him up” sign shouted: “You assaulted the first amendment!” Guardian US editor Lee Glendinning said in a statement: “This decision should remind all those in positions of authority that a free press, like freedom of speech, is one of the building blocks of American democracy, established under the first amendment. The Guardian thanks our colleagues across the whole media spectrum, whether liberal or conservative, for their solidarity and support for Ben Jacobs over the last few weeks. We will continue to pose tough questions on behalf of our readers.” The Montana Democrats called on Gianforte to resign after the sentencing, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called him a “violent criminal” in a statement, saying his “guilty plea to this heinous assault shows he’s absolutely unfit for, and unworthy of, the honor of representing Montana”. Spokespeople for the National Republican Congressional Committee and House speaker Paul Ryan declined to comment on the guilty plea. While Monday’s proceedings bring a close to the criminal case, Gianforte could still face discipline in Congress. On 2 June, a coalition of press freedom organizations filed a complaint with congressional ethics officials asking that Gianforte be disciplined for the assault. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In this news article, it talks about a man named Greg Gianforte who is a congressman-elect, which means he is someone chosen to be a part of the group that makes laws for the United States.

Uther's lust for Cornwall's wife Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) soon ruins the truce, and Merlin agrees to help Uther to seduce Igrayne on the condition that he gives Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the Charm of Making. Cornwall's daughter Morgana senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp; and, while Igrayne is fooled by the disguise and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son Arthur. Uther pursues but is mortally wounded by Gorlois' knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \\"None shall wield Excalibur, but me!\\", and Merlin proclaims, \\"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\\" Years later Sir Ector and his sons, Kay and Arthur (Nigel Terry) attend a jousting tournament. Sir Leondegrance (Patrick Stewart) wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but he fails. Kay's sword is later stolen, and Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone while trying to replace the stolen sword. Word spreads, and Merlin announces to the crowd that Arthur is Uther's son and, hence, the rightful ruler. Leondegrance immediately proclaims his support for the new king, but not all are willing to accept. While the others argue, Merlin and Arthur enter the forest, where Merlin tells Arthur that he is the rightful king and that the king and the land are one. Overwhelmed, Arthur falls into a long sleep.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed A:","completion":"Step 1: Fluid containing waste enters the kidneys. Justification: The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood, so the fluid containing waste must first reach the kidneys. Step 2: A processing moment in the kidneys lets waste and fluid pass. Justification: The nephrons, which are the functional units within the kidneys, filter the waste and fluid from the blood. Step 3: Prevents larger molecules from passing. Justification: The filtration membrane of the nephrons has pores that limit the size of molecules that can pass, allowing only smaller waste and fluid molecules to pass through. Step 4: Fluid goes back to the bloodstream. Justification: The filtrate, which contains waste and water, is processed in the nephron tubules, where useful substances and water are absorbed back into the bloodstream. Step 5: Bad waste is removed. Justification: The filtrate containing the waste products continues through the nephron tubules, ultimately reaching the collecting ducts, where it becomes concentrated as urine. Final step (Step 6): Urine is eliminated from the body. Justification: The urine containing waste products and excess fluid is transported from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, and eventually, it is expelled from the body through the urethra. This is considered the final step because it is the completion of the waste removal process and the maintenance of the body's fluid balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Ashcroft was the only son of office worker Frank and hairdresser Louise (nee Baxter); he also has two younger sisters. His middle name, Paul, is also the name of a paternal uncle. When Ashcroft was 11, his father died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage. Ashcroft soon \\"fell under the influence of his stepfather\\", who belonged to the Rosicrucians. Context: Ashcroft's first solo single, \\"A Song for the Lovers\\", peaked at No. 3 in the UK charts in April 2000. It was followed by the single \\"Money to Burn\\" which reached the UK Top 20 at No. 17. The album, Alone with Everybody, was released in June, reaching number 1 and receiving platinum status in the UK. Album reviews were generally positive. In September, a third single was released - \\"C'mon People (We're Making It Now)\\" - entering the charts at No. 21. Richard does not publish the lyrics to his songs in the inlay cards of his albums or singles as he feels they are personal to him. Ashcroft began work on his second album Human Conditions in 2002. The lead single, \\"Check the Meaning\\", was released in early October, and peaked at No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was released later that month and reached No. 3 in the UK Album Chart. Reception to the album was generally positive. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 61% based on 15 reviews. In response to negative reaction to the album, Coldplay's Chris Martin - a fan of both Ashcroft and The Verve - defended the album's merits which \\"made an impression\\" on Ashcroft.

Given the following context: Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire.

The premise states that \\"Two men are working on a roof in yellow coats.\\" From this information, we gather that there are two individuals involved in some kind of work on a roof and they are wearing yellow coats. Step 2: Analyze the content of the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"Two men are fixing a leak in the roof.\\" This information suggests that the work being done by the two men involves repairing a leak in the roof. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. In this step, I will compare the information provided in the premise to the information provided in the hypothesis. The common elements between the two are that there are two men working on a roof.

The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, I will research Fernando Arrabal and James Young to determine if they are both film directors. Step 1: Research Fernando Arrabal Fernando Arrabal is a Spanish playwright, screenwriter, film director, novelist, and poet. He was born on August 11, 1932, in Melilla, Spain. He is best known for his work in the field of film and has directed numerous movies including \\"Viva la muerte\\" (1971) and \\"The Tree of Guernica\\" (1975). Step 2: Research James Young There are multiple individuals named James Young, so I will attempt to find a James Young related to the film industry. After researching, I found that James Young is an American film director, primarily known for his work in the documentary film genre. He has directed films such as “Curse of the Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story” (1993) and “Unscripted” (2005). Based on my research, I can conclude that both Fernando Arrabal and James Young are indeed film directors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her.

I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. who is the author? - not enough information - an engineer - a manager - a scientist","completion":"The author is the individual sharing their experiences and thoughts throughout the text. While their full identity or name isn't explicitly given in the text, based on their described roles and responsibilities such as setting up projects, managing project budgets, and negotiating with contractors like the designer named Fergus, it can be inferred that the author is an \\"Engineer\\" who likely has managerial duties as well. To break it down: 1. \\"One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project.\\" - this sentence indicates that the author's primary role is that of an engineer. 2. The author's interaction with Fergus, including the negotiation about the project's budget and timeline, indicates managerial duties as well. However, there is no evidence for the author being a scientist specifically. Therefore, while an engineer inherently applies scientific principles, it would be incorrect to label them solely as a 'scientist' without any explicit mention or supporting information about them conducting fundamental research or scientific studies. As for the first and last options - 'Not enough information' and 'A manager', the author has provided enough information about their role and responsibilities for us to deduce that they are an engineer with some managerial duties.

Stitt went to prison in 2004 after pleading guilty to a reckless homicide charge stemming from the death of Caitlin Weese, a 17-year-old student at Larkin High School in Elgin. A Palatine man who served a 7½-year prison sentence for killing a 17-year-old girl in a 2003 drunken driving crash was arrested again over the weekend, after police say he got behind the wheel after drinking and drove into two parked cars. James T. Stitt, 34, of the 0-100 block of South Hale Street, is charged with aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol in connection with the crash late Saturday night on the north side of the village. Stitt went to prison in 2004 after pleading guilty to a reckless homicide charge stemming from the death of Caitlin Weese, a 17-year-old student at Larkin High School in Elgin. Authorities at the time said Stitt, then a Lake Zurich resident, had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal threshold and marijuana in his system on May 22, 2003, when his vehicle veered into oncoming traffic on Route 72 near Gilberts. His car collided head-on with one driven by Caitlin, who died two days later. Caitlin, authorities said, had been driving home to Wonder Lake after buying an outfit to wear at her high school graduation, which would have been eight days later. A roadside marker reading \\"Please don't drink and drive\\" and memorializing Caitlin stands near the crash site. Stitt was sentenced to 7½ years in prison and paroled in 2009 after serving the minimum 85 percent of his sentence the law requires. \\"I wish I knew what the answer was,\\" Joel Mains, Caitlin's stepfather, said Monday after learning of Stitt's arrest from Palatine police. \\"For some people stiffer penalties might work, and for others, I'm afraid nothing might work.\\" Mains said he and Caitlin's sister, stepsister and stepbrother were talking about Stitt's newest DUI charge all day. They plan to follow his case through the court system and attend his next court hearing. \\"I obviously am disappointed and the family is disappointed,\\" Mains said. \\"This stirs up a whole new set of feelings that had been kind of under the surface for quite some time.

A witness reported that a black 2003 Lincoln LS struck two parked cars and then parked nearby, with the driver remaining inside, police said. Officers found the driver, later identified as Stitt, unconscious and slumped over the steering wheel of his vehicle, according to police. Upon speaking with the driver, officers detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his mouth, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, police reported. Stitt appeared in Cook County court on the new charge Monday, when Judge Joseph Cataldo set his bail at 75,000, meaning he must post 7,500 to go free while the case is pending. He remained in county custody as of late Monday, records indicate. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison, county prosecutors said. Stitt's background includes a 1997 DUI conviction for which he received supervision, prosecutors said. He also has a 2001 reckless driving conviction from Lake County. He next appears in court on Dec. 15. • Daily Herald staff writer Barbara Vitello contributed to this report. ||||| A decade after a motorist was sentenced to prison for a fatal drunken driving crash, the man was again charged with DUI in Palatine, authorities said. James T. Stitt, 34, of the first block of South Hale Street in Palatine, was found unconscious and slumped over his car's steering wheel shortly before midnight Saturday, said police, who added that officers smelled alcohol on Stitt's breath and reported that his speech was slurred and his eyes bloodshot. Police said they were called after a 2003 Lincoln LS was seen crashing into two parked cars in the 700 block of Independence Drive, which is about 4 miles from Stitt's home. Stitt was arrested after failing a field sobriety test and charged with felony aggravated DUI, officials said. Palatine police said he was ordered held on 75,000 bond and is expected to appear in court Dec. 15. The arrest came 10 years after Stitt was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for drunken driving in a wreck that killed 17-year-old Caitlin Weese weeks before she was to graduate from Larkin High School in Elgin. Stitt was released from prison in September 2009 and was on probation for two years after that, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections. Stitt got his driver's license back on Jan. 25, 2013, according to the Illinois secretary of state's office. Palatine police said he was driving with a valid license the night of the most recent arrest. In May 2003, Weese was headed home to Wonder Lake from a mall when Stitt, then 23, swerved into the westbound lane of Illinois Highway 72 near Gilberts in Kane County. He hit Weese's car head-on in the night while driving on a suspended license. Records show Stitt has been charged with DUI in 1997, when he was 17, and again in 2001. In the earlier charge, the case was closed after Stitt satisfactorily completed DUI school and a year of supervision, records show. In 2001, he pleaded guilty to reckless driving and was sentenced to two years of probation and DUI school. In between the two DUI charges, Stitt received two moving violations within a 12-month period, resulting in his license being suspended from June 2000 to June 2003, according to the secretary of state's office. Weese became the first victim of a DUI crash in Illinois to be memorialized with a roadside \\"Please Don't Drink and Drive\\" marker installed by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Her marker was erected in 2008 at the site of her fatal crash. Weese's mother, Diane Mains, became a prominent victims advocate with Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists following Weese's death. Mains died in 2006. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A man named James T.

In one study, striking increases in IQ occurred in 25 children who were moved from an orphanage to more stimulating(,) environments.The children, who were all considered mentally retarded and unadoptable, were moved to an institution where they received personal attention from adults.Later, these supposedly retarded children were adopted by parents who gave them love, a family ,and a stimulating home environment.The children gained an average of 29 IQ points.For one child, the increase was an amazing 58 points.A second group of initially less \\"retarded\\" children, who stayed in the orphanage, lost an average of 26 IQ points. Other encouraging results can be found in early childhood education programs, which provide stimulating intellectual experiences for disadvantaged children.In one study, children from low-income families were given enriched environments from early infancy through preschool.By age 2 their IQ scores were already higher than those in a control group.More important, they were still 5 points higher seven years later.High-quality enrichment programs such as Head Start can prevent children from falling behind in school. A particularly striking environmental effect is the fact that 14 nations have shown average IQ gains of from 5 to 25 points during the last 30 years.These IQ boosts, averaging 15 points, occurred in far too short a time for genetics to explain them.It is more likely that the gains reflect environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society.

Railways are included in the Emissions Trading System, but buses are not, which again puts buses at an advantage and trains at a disadvantage. Translate to Romanian","completion":"Căile ferate sunt incluse în Sistemul de Comerț cu Eșalonări de Emisii, dar autobuzele nu sunt, ceea ce pune din nou autobuzele într-un avantaj și trenurile într-un dezavantaj. Sistemul de Comerț cu Eșalonări de Emisii este un mecanism prin care guvernele și companiile pot limita și controla emisiile de gaze cu efect de seră. Acest sistem stabilește un număr maxim de emisii permise și apoi distribuie credite de carbon către companiile care participă la sistem. Acestea își pot vinde sau cumpăra creditele pe piața de carbon și, astfel, trebuie să reducă emisiile lor. Motivul pentru care căile ferate sunt incluse în sistem, dar autobuzele nu sunt, se datorează faptului că sectorul feroviar emite o cantitate semnificativă mai mare de emisii de gaze cu efect de seră în comparație cu transportul public în autobuz. În general, energia utilizată pentru a alimenta trenurile provine din combustibili fosili, precum petrolul și cărbunele, care produc gaze cu efect de seră. Cu toate acestea, autobuzele beneficiază de mai multe avantaje dacă le comparăm cu trenurile. Unul dintre aceste avantaje este faptul că autobuzele pot utiliza combustibili mai ecologici și tehnologii de propulsie mai eficiente, cum ar fi motoarele electrice și cele pe bază de hidrogen. În plus, rețeaua de transport cu autobuz este mai flexibilă și poate oferi servicii personalizate pentru a se adapta la nevoile utilizatorilor. În ciuda acestor avantaje, trenurile rămân o opțiune mai rapidă și mai eficientă pe distanțe lungi și în zonele dezvoltate. Având în vedere toți factorii implicați, este important să se promoveze tehnologii și politici care să echilibreze impactul asupra mediului al ambelor tipuri de transport și să se încurajeze o semnificativă reducere a emisiilor în toate sectoarele de transport.

First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. But I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: What is an answer for this question: Which case would see clockwise movement, case A or case B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Case B would see clockwise movement. In the given background information, it is mentioned that all planets in the Solar System, including Mars (case A), orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole. Therefore, case A (Mars) would have counter-clockwise movement. On the other hand, WASP-17b (case B) is an extrasolar planet that has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. This indicates that, unlike the planets in the Solar System, WASP-17b exhibits clockwise movement. So, case B (WASP-17b) would see the clockwise movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","completion":"The term for an underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer. Aquifers are essential components of the hydrogeological cycle and play a crucial role in storing and supplying water resources to ecosystems, agriculture, and human populations. Aquifers are typically composed of permeable materials such as sand, gravel, or porous rock formations, which allow water to flow through them easily. These permeable materials are surrounded by confining layers, which are made up of low-permeability materials such as clay or dense rock that impede the flow of water. The process of water infiltrating through the soil, accumulating in the aquifer, and eventually discharging into springs, rivers, or wells is known as groundwater recharge. There are two main types of aquifers: 1. Unconfined aquifers: These aquifers are not bound by a confining layer. The water table, which is the upper surface where soil or rock is fully saturated with water, defines their upper boundary. Unconfined aquifers are generally closer to the surface and are more susceptible to contamination from human activities and natural processes. The recharge of unconfined aquifers is typically driven by rainfall or snowmelt infiltrating directly into the aquifer. 2. Confined aquifers: These aquifers are bound by two confining layers, making them more protected from external influences. Confined aquifers can store water under pressure, which is known as artesian pressure. When tapped by a well, water may rise in the well above the top of the confined aquifer due to this pressure, sometimes reaching the surface as a flowing artesian well. The recharge of confined aquifers occurs where water can percolate through the confining layer and infiltrate the aquifer, often at higher elevations or greater distances from the discharge point. Aquifers are vital sources of fresh water, providing drinking water to millions of people worldwide, as well as supporting agriculture and industry. Unfortunately, due to factors such as over-extraction, land-use changes, and contamination, many aquifers are facing increased stress and depletion. Therefore, it is important to responsibly manage and protect these valuable groundwater resources through sustainable extraction practices, monitoring, and remediation efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bei manchen Büchern fragt man sich wahrlich, wie sie es in TopTen-Listen schaffen. Zugegeben, der Covertext liest sich spannend und weckt Erinnerungen an schöne Stunden mit Dan Browns Illuminati - sonst hätte ich das Buch sicher auch nicht gekauft. Die Zutaten scheinen perfekt: Ein lebendig eingemauertes Opfer dem weitere seltsame Todesfälle folgen, eine mysteriöse Glaubensgemeinschaft, experimentelle Hightech-Industrie, korrupte Geschäftsleute mit den besten Verbindungen in höchste Kreise und mitten drin ein kleiner Künstler und Hobbydetektiv, der schon bald um sein Leben rennen muss - verfolgt von seinen ursprünglichen Auftraggebern. Zwischen den Buchdeckeln dann jedoch die Ernüchterung. Die Story schleppt sich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes dahin. Nach dem Einstiegsopfer passiert lange Zeit nur Nebensächliches. Für ein Buch mit nur 420 Seiten werden dabei zu viele Details rund um den Hauptcharakter eingebunden, die der Story kaum etwas bringen. Da wo diese dann mal in Schwung kommt, ist sie dermaßen trocken und platt geschrieben, dass an Spannung kaum zu denken ist. Vieles ist vorhersehbar, selbst der Schluss.

Wir können mehr tun, wenn wir dem Priorität einräumen, und wir können unsere Kinder vor dieser gewalttätigen und verabscheuungswürdigen Form des Missbrauchs schützen. Which language is this?","completion":"This text is in German. Here is a detailed explanation of the language and its characteristics: German is a West Germanic language primarily spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Belgium, among other countries and regions where German-speaking communities are present. It is one of the world's most widely spoken languages, with an estimated 100 million native speakers and millions more who speak it as a second language. The German language uses a 26-letter Latin-based alphabet, just like English, but has some additional characters such as umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and a unique character called the Eszett or sharp S (ß), which is used in place of 'ss' in some words. German is an inflected language, which means that nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs may change their forms according to their function in a sentence. There are four cases in German: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. Furthermore, German is well-known for its long, compound words that are formed by combining multiple smaller words. This allows for a great deal of specificity in the language, but may appear daunting to new learners. For example, the word \\"Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän\\" (Danube steamship company captain) is a single German word combining several smaller words. Finally, another notable aspect of the German language is its use of gendered articles. German has three grammatical genders: masculine (der), feminine (die), and neuter (das), which must be used accordingly with the corresponding nouns. Gender in German is not always logical or directly related to the gender of the thing being described, so the gender of nouns often must be memorized as part of learning the language. In summary, German is a widely spoken West Germanic language that is characterized by its use of inflections, compound words, and grammatical genders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who’s the only major deity to have the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology? Answer:","completion":"The only major deity to have the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology is Apollo. Apollo is a significant ancient deity who is acknowledged in both Roman and Greek traditions. He is a multifaceted god and his domains encompass various aspects of life. In both cultures, he is noted as the god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more. In Greek mythology, Apollo is the son of Zeus, the king of all gods, and Leto, a daughter of the ancient Titans Coeus and Phoebe. He is also famously known as the twin brother of Artemis, the virgin goddess of the hunt. Apollo, who is associated with the Delphic oracle, is said to have been born on the island of Delos, which was considered a major cult center of worshiping him during the classical times. Interestingly, in the Hellenistic period, Apollo was connected with the sun, just like Helios, who is conventionally viewed as the Sun god. In art and literature, they were gradually identified with each other. In Roman mythology, Apollo was adapted from the Greek tradition around the 5th century BCE. While the Romans had a god of the sun, Sol, they began to adopt the Greek stories and attributes of Apollo and associate them with him. Eventually, like the Greeks, Romans also considered Apollo as the god of healing, prophecy, and truth. One compelling aspect about Apollo in comparison to other gods is that while most Roman gods have different names than their Greek counterparts — for example, Zeus is known as Jupiter in Roman mythology, and Aphrodite is known as Venus — Apollo remains Apollo. Although Romans did latinize his name to Apollō, the Latin spelling starkly resembles the Greek version. Despite the similarities, the representation and interpretation of Apollo can differ slightly depending upon the culture. For instance, Roman Apollo is often depicted with a beard, while Greek Apollo is usually represented as an idealized beardless youth. Regardless, the essence of Apollo – as a radiant, multifaceted deity highly esteemed for his various capacities related to music, prophecy, health, the sun, and more – remains constant in both cultures. This suggests a significant level of cultural exchange and assimilation between the ancient Greek and Roman societies in relation to their religious and mythological practices. In conclusion, while the Roman mythology typically borrows from the Greek, adapting their stories and characters, the character of Apollo stands out as unique. Unlike other deities, his name stays the same between the two cultures, and essentially, he retains his manifold associations and functions, reinforcing his prominence in both Greek and Roman mythology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the context: What will Skylar want to do next? Answer:","completion":"Without additional specific details about Skylar's preferences and reactions, it's challenging to assume what their precise next move will be. However, we can make informative assumptions grounded on typical human behavior and basic psychology. A common reaction would be for Skylar to appreciate Kendall's willingness to understand their struggle by living like them for a day. By making such a gesture, Kendall communicates empathy and an open mind towards Skylar's difficulties, which can be comforting and supportive. Skylar might feel the need to reciprocate, therefore there are diverse courses of actions they might take. Here are a couple of likely options: 1. Skylar may want to open up more to Kendall: Since Kendall has made the first step toward understanding Skylar's world, Skylar might feel the need to help Kendall comprehend better. This could involve expressing their feelings, explaining their everyday struggles, and clarifying the specific challenges they face. The open communication could act as a platform for Skylar to let out their worries, fears, and problems, which might have posed a challenge if Kendall hadn't stepped in. 2. Reach out to Kendall using their language: The gesture Kendall made could inspire Skylar to understand Kendall's world as well. Skylar might decide to spend a day in Kendall's life, observing and learning how Kendall deals with problems, how they think, and what they feel. By doing so, Skylar might discover ways to adapt or incorporate Kendall's problem-solving techniques into their life. 3. Seek professional help: Kendall's action might also help Skylar realize that their struggles are recognized by others, pushing them to seek additional assistance. They may decide to seek professional help like talking to a counselor or a psychologist. Besides, they could consider joining support groups where they can meet people experiencing similar challenges. 4. Working on Personal Growth: Reflecting upon the efforts Kendall is making, Skylar might decide to work on their personal growth and development to combat the problems they're facing. This might involve making lifestyle changes, learning new skills, or focusing on mental health exercises like meditation and mindfulness. In conclusion, Kendall's empathetic step might be a turning point in Skylar's struggle, making them feel seen, valued, and motivated enough to reciprocate the effort or seek the help they need. The next moves Skylar chooses would ultimately depend on their personality, comfort level, and the particular struggles they're dealing with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The soap of Jennifer works a lot worse than the one that Monica uses, so","completion":"The soap of Jennifer works a lot worse than the one that Monica uses, so Jennifer often finds herself battling with stubborn dirt, grease, and grime on her clothes, skin, and household surfaces. In contrast, Monica's soap provides exceptional cleaning results and a refreshing scent, leaving her feeling confident and satisfied with her overall hygiene and domestic tidiness. This noticeable discrepancy between the effectiveness of Jennifer's and Monica's soaps may be attributed to a variety of factors, such as differences in the soap's ingredients, manufacturing process, or overall quality. For instance, Jennifer's soap may contain fewer or less potent cleaning agents, which could contribute to its diminished ability to tackle dirt and stains effectively. Additionally, her soap may lack the essential oils, moisturizers, or other beneficial additives that are present in Monica's soap, thereby reducing its capacity to nourish and protect the skin from dryness and irritation. On the other hand, Monica's soap may be formulated with a superior blend of ingredients that not only promote thorough cleaning but also help maintain skin's natural balance, suppleness, and radiance. It is likely that her soap contains premium quality surfactants and cleaning agents, which swiftly break down and remove dirt and oils, leaving surfaces spotless and free from residue. Furthermore, the inclusion of natural extracts, such as aloe vera, chamomile, or lavender, may offer soothing and rejuvenating properties that elevate her soap's overall performance and user experience. As Jennifer continues to use her subpar soap, she becomes increasingly frustrated with its inability to meet her needs and expectations. Consequently, she may decide to seek alternatives, conducting research on various soap brands and formulations to gain a deeper understanding of what distinguishes an excellent soap from a mediocre one. By examining customer reviews, comparing price points, and considering the environmental impacts and ethical considerations of different soap manufacturers, Jennifer will be better equipped to make an informed decision when selecting a new soap – one that hopefully mirrors the remarkable efficacy of Monica's soap. Ultimately, Jennifer's quest for a superior soap will not only improve her personal hygiene and the cleanliness of her home but also impart valuable knowledge about the importance of using quality products. Armed with this newfound awareness, Jennifer – along with anyone else who faces a similar predicament – can make smarter choices that maximize their satisfaction and contribute to a healthier, happier, and cleaner lifestyle for themselves and their loved ones. In conclusion, the suboptimal performance of Jennifer's soap compared to Monica's highlights the significance of using quality cleansing products in our everyday lives. Whether for personal hygiene or household chores, investing in a superior soap can make all the difference in one's overall cleanliness, comfort, and well-being. By carefully considering factors such as ingredients, manufacturing practices, and environmental and ethical implications, one can ultimately find a soap that not only works effectively but also aligns with personal values and beliefs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Anthony Baxter won awards at film festivals around the world for his critically-acclaimed 2011 movie You've Been Trumped despite it being branded a \\"failure\\" by the powerful property magnate who reportedly tried to prevent BBC2 from screening the documentary. As Trump squares up to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the US presidential race, Montrose-based Baxter is putting the finishing touches to a hard-hitting follow-up to his original project. You've Been Trumped Too revisits the family of Michael Forbes, four years after the Trump International Golf Links opened in Aberdeenshire. Mr Forbes was the \\"David\\" to Mr Trump's \\"Goliath\\" in the first film, as he refused to sell his land to the US tycoon. But Mr Trump's representatives in Scotland have already criticised the project, accusing Baxter of \\"peddling lies and nonsense\\" about the company for years. They said they have not seen the film and have \\"no interest\\" in it. Baxter claims the Forbes family have been without a proper water supply for five years - since construction workers accidentally cut it off while they were building the luxury golf resort. Despite promises from the Trump organisation to fix the problem, the filmmaker said he found Mr Forbes's 92-year-old mother, Molly, using a wheelbarrow to collect water from a nearby stream. Their experience, according to Baxter, shows that \\"what [Trump] says and what he does are two very different things\\". The film is expected to open in independent cinemas across the UK at the end of October but Baxter is especially keen for it to be seen by an American audience before the US presidential election. He told the BBC Scotland website: \\"The Trump organisation said back in 2010 that the Forbes would have the best water they'd ever had. \\"But while Trump was running for president, Molly Forbes was collecting water with a wheelbarrow from a nearby burn. What he says and what he does is two very different things.\\" And he questioned Trump's pledge to create thousands of jobs with the golf resort on the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire. \\"He's under pressure at the moment over not releasing his taxes and says constantly that he's created tens of thousands of jobs,\\" said Baxter. \\"He promised 6,000 jobs in Scotland but he created a few dozen jobs, one golf course, a clubhouse and an upscale B&B. \\"What he promises and what he delivers are very different. \\"It's important to get it out to American voters before the election. It's a side to Donald Trump they have never seen before.\\" He hopes to raise 75,000 (Â£59,000) through crowd-funding to boost awareness of the project in the US and have it shown in movie theatres across the country. In five days, the project has raised more than 35,000 (Â£27,500). The film also follows Michael Forbes and his wife, Sheila, as they travel to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Baxter said the couple wanted to try to understand the appeal of Trump and to speak to delegates about their own experiences in Aberdeenshire. He added: \\"I was amazed to observe the ongoing consequences of Donald Trump's actions in Scotland, at the very same time he was running for president and felt it was a story American voters needed to hear before 8 November.\\" In a statement, a spokeswoman for Trump International Golf Links said: \\"We have not seen the so-called film and have no interest in it. \\"Anthony Baxter is not a credible journalist or filmmaker. He has no interest in the facts or the people of north east Scotland. \\"He has propagated lies and nonsense about the company for years in an attempt to make a name for himself off the back of Trump. \\"We operate a highly acclaimed, five-star golf resort and enjoy a great relationship with the local community and all of our neighbours with the exception of a few who have fought the project since its inception.\\"","completion":"A man named Anthony Baxter made a movie in 2011 called \\"You've Been Trumped\\" about a powerful person named Donald Trump.

Their strength is determined by their ability to donate these protons in an aqueous solution, and it is categorized into two groups: strong acids and weak acids. 1. Strong acids: These acids completely ionize in water, which means they donate all their protons (H+) to the solution. When a strong acid dissolves in water, it breaks apart into its constituent ions. Examples of strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and nitric acid (HNO3). In the case of hydrochloric acid, for instance, the complete ionization reaction would be: HCl (aq) -> H+ (aq) + Cl- (aq) The \\"aq\\" denotes that these species are in an aqueous solution. As we can observe from the equation, hydrochloric acid dissociates completely, releasing all its hydrogen ions into the solution. 2. Weak acids: In contrast, weak acids only partially ionize in water. They do not donate all their protons to the solution, leading to an equilibrium between the ionized and non-ionized forms of the acid. Examples of weak acids include acetic acid (CH3COOH), carbonic acid (H2CO3), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). To exemplify the partial ionization process, let's take a look at the reaction of acetic acid with water: CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) <=> H3O+ (aq) + CH3COO- (aq) Notice that the double arrow implies equilibrium between reactants and products, indicating that the reaction is reversible and does not go to completion. Weak acids, like acetic acid, dissociate only to a small extent, not releasing all their hydrogen ions into the solution. Returning to David's case, since Sample A is a strong acid, it would completely ionize in water, whereas Sample B, being a weak acid, would only partially ionize. Therefore, the answer to the question is Sample B."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

Question: This article: A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. contains an answer for the question: What were the full names of the two people whose libraries they left formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium?, what is it ?

Rather than excommunicate Bruce, Wishart absolved him and urged people to rise in his support. They both then travelled to Scone, where they were met by Lamberton and other prominent churchmen and nobles. Less than seven weeks after the killing in Dumfries, at Scone Abbey on 25 March 1306, Robert Bruce was crowned as King Robert I of Scotland. He then began a new campaign to free his kingdom. After being defeated in battle, he was driven from the Scottish mainland as an outlaw. Bruce later came out of hiding in 1307. The Scots thronged to him, and he defeated the English in a number of battles. His forces continued to grow in strength, encouraged in part by the death of Edward I in July 1307. The Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was an especially important Scottish victory. In 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath was sent by a group of Scottish nobles to the Pope affirming Scottish independence from England. Two similar declarations were also sent by the clergy and Robert I. In 1327, Edward II of England was deposed and killed. The invasion of the North of England by Robert the Bruce forced Edward III of England to sign the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton on 1 May 1328, which recognised the independence of Scotland with Bruce as King.

Based on the premise \\"But, in his anxiety, the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\\" I was silent. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert. \\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it is difficult to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert\\" is true. The premise does not provide enough evidence relating to the composure, alertness, or steadiness of the criminal. However, we can extract some information from the first sentence and analyze its meaning to further examine the hypothesis. The premise revolves around a criminal, Inglethorp, and the intricately woven net symbolizing the crime. The word \\"anxiety\\" suggests that the criminal is under considerable stress, which could indicate a lack of steady composure. When a person is anxious, they tend to exhibit signs of uneasiness, worry, or fear, which are not typically exhibited by someone who is fully composed, steady, and alert. Furthermore, since the anxiety resulted in the criminal drawing the net too closely, this could insinuate haste or a lack of precision, challenging the idea of the criminal being fully composed and alert to the situation. The second sentence - \\"I was silent.\\" - could be perceived as a reaction to the scenario described in the first sentence. This silence does not provide any additional evidence to support or directly refute the hypothesis. However, the speaker's silence could imply that they are taking time to carefully consider the matter or re-evaluate the hypothesis themselves based on the newly presented information. In summary, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"The criminal had full composure and was steady and alert\\" is true from the given premise. The anxiety experienced by the criminal may suggest that they lacked steady composure. This unfavorable state could have contributed to them making mistakes in the crime, leading to the idea that one can free Inglethorp from the tightly drawn net. However, the premise-by-itself does not provide enough evidence to support or wholly discard the hypothesis. It would be beneficial to gather more information and context to better evaluate the hypothesis's validity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(2) Have an assistant., does the word have mean the same thing?","completion":"No, the word \\"have\\" in these two sentences does not exactly mean the same thing. In Sentence 1 (\\"I have a house and a car\\"), \\"have\\" is a verb that shows possession or ownership. In this context, it means that the speaker owns or possess a house and a car. It is an example of a transitive verb, which means the verb \\"have\\" transfers action from the subject (\\"I\\") to the object (\\"a house\\" and \\"a car\\"). This action is the act of possessing or owning. On the other hand, in Sentence 2 (\\"Have an assistant\\"), \\"have\\" is used as an imperative verb to indicate a command, request, or advice. Here, the speaker is instructing or advising someone else to employ or get an assistant. This is a less common use of \\"have\\" and the sentence is less straightforward in meaning than the first. The word \\"have\\" still indicates some form of possession, but in this case instead of stating an existing possession, it suggests an action that should be taken by someone else for getting or possessing something. In both instances, “have” involves possession but one is in the context of stating a possession and the other is in advising or commanding to possess. It's also worth mentioning that accuracy of the interpretation can also somewhat depend on the broader context not given here. For example, \\"Have an assistant\\" could potentially mean that the speaker is stating they have an assistant themselves, if it is in response to a question, such as \\"Do you have any help?\\" but without more context, it's impossible to be sure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run. Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal. On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal. The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out. After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards. In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game. With the win, Buffalo snapped a two-game losing streak and improved to 6-6.

Napoleon Bonaparte, having kept his guardians from killing the pair, exchanges his physicianâs services with Edmond for the delivery of a letter to a Monsieur Clarion. In Marseille, the company owner Morrell commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over First Mate Danglars, who gave Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba.

Worker X has a defective rate of 0.5% and Worker Y has a defective rate of 0.8%. The combined defective rate of both workers is 0.55%. We need to find out what fraction of the products was checked by Worker Y. Step 2: Set up an equation Let the fraction of products checked by Worker Y be represented by Y. Then, the fraction of products checked by Worker X would be 1 - Y (since the total fraction must equal 1). Step 3: Use the given information to create the equation The combined defective rate is calculated by taking a weighted average of the defective rates of both workers. So, we can represent this as: (0.005 * (1 - Y)) + (0.008 * Y) = 0.0055 Step 4: Solve the equation for Y 0.005 - 0.005Y + 0.008Y = 0.0055 0.003Y = 0.0005 Y = 0.0005 / 0.003 Y = 1 / 6 Step 5: Choose the correct answer choice The fraction of products checked by Worker Y is 1/6.

Unlike Monica, Katrina had a hard time getting a loan due to her credit score.","completion":"Katrina sat across from the loan officer, nervously fidgeting with her fingers. The bland, sterile walls of the bank did nothing to help ease her anxiety. She thought the process of getting a loan would be straightforward, but her mounting financial issues were catching up to her now. She couldn't help but compare herself to her best friend, Monica, who had recently secured a loan with seemingly no trouble at all. \\"Mrs. Thompson, I'm sorry to inform you that your loan application has been denied,\\" said the loan officer in a dry, emotionless tone. She proceeded to explain that the reason for the rejection was Katrina's poor credit score. Feeling defeated, Katrina took a deep breath and thanked the officer for her time, doing her best to hide the embarrassment and disappointment she felt. Upon leaving the bank, Katrina decided to take a long walk to clear her head. She knew she needed to take matters into her own hands to rectify her credit score, as her rejection at the bank weighed heavily on her mind. If people like Monica could secure a loan with such ease, why couldn't she do the same? Was her situation that much worse, or had she somehow not been as careful as she should have been with her finances? Determined to get answers, Katrina headed home and began searching online for ways to improve her credit score. She spent hours researching, understanding the factors that led to a lower credit score, and learning how she could tackle each of these issues step by step. First and foremost, Katrina realized she had too much debt relative to her income. This factor was making her a risky borrower in the eyes of the bank. She decided to take up a part-time job to increase her earnings and allocated a portion of her new income toward paying down her credit card balances, prioritizing those with the highest interest rates. In her research, Katrina also discovered the importance of paying bills on time. She was surprised to find out that her cell phone bill, which she occasionally paid a week or two late, was negatively impacting her credit score. To avoid any further late payments, she set up automatic bill payments for all of her monthly expenses. Additionally, Katrina understood that it was essential to have a mix of credit, which the creditors view as an indication of responsible borrowing. Though she had a few credit cards, she barely used any of them, which wasn't helping her credit score either. Consequently, Katrina strategized to make small purchases on each of her credit cards and pay off the balance in full every month without incurring interest. Katrina's determination didn't waver, and she soldiered on through months of consistent hard work to improve her credit score piece by piece. The part-time job pushed her to her limits, but she held onto the hope that it would all be worth it in the end. A year later, Katrina found herself back in the cold, sterile bank. This time, equipped with her newfound knowledge about credit scores, she felt much more confident about her chances of getting the loan. And sure enough, she was greeted with the loan officer's approval. As Katrina excitedly signed the loan documents, she couldn't help but think back to the days when she compared herself to Monica and the journey that led her to this very moment. Through persistence and understanding, she had successfully turned her financial life around. With her regained self-esteem, she realized that every hardship she had overcome had only made her a stronger person. She left the bank that day with a loan in her name, ready to create a brighter future and undeterred by the challenges that may come her way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: bored about planning a wedding B: excited C: elated to be engaged to Austin Answer:","completion":"The context provided doesn't directly specify the girlfriend's reaction or feelings to Austin's proposal. However, considering the normal joy and anticipation affiliated with such a scenario, we can make an educated guess regarding her presumed response. In light of that, option B: \\"excited\\" and option C: \\"elated to be engaged to Austin\\" potentially stands as valid responses. We can rule out option A: \\"bored about planning a wedding\\" as it is somewhat negative and doesn't align with the romantic context of a marriage proposal, hence it can be seen as incongruous. However, between options B and C, the latter seems to be more appropriate as it is more explicit and relevant to the context provided.

Tips: \\"Stalk\\" before meeting, don't meet at your home, bring a friend.","completion":"Title: Safeguarding the Spark: A Guide to Navigating Online Relationships Turn Real-Life Encounters Online dating has become the new frontier of forming connections and relationships, especially in a world that's increasingly moving online. While this form of connection has expanded the possibilities for finding love, it also comes with risks. The creators of the popular MTV show “Catfish,” based on the documentary of the same name, emphasize the importance of playing it safe when meeting an online acquaintance in real life. “Catfish” brings online crushes together, highlighting the reality that people often aren't what they seem from behind a computer screen. With this in mind, here are some vital tips to ensure your safety and well-being when transitioning an online relationship to reality. Tip 1: Perform a Background Check Before you decide to meet your online crush, consider doing a bit of “stalking” to ensure they are a genuine person and not someone with ill intentions. Use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn to verify their identity. You can discover mutual connections, gather additional information about their interests, and check their consistency with what they have shared online. Additionally, try to perform a simple Google search on their name or photos to see if any red flags appear. In today's world, it's better to be safe than sorry. Tip 2: Choose a Public Venue for the First Meeting When preparing to meet your online acquaintance, insist on having the first encounter at a public place. Busy venues like coffee shops, restaurants, or parks are ideal locations, as they have a constant flow of people. By choosing such locations, you help ensure a safe environment where both parties feel comfortable. Avoid meeting at your home or their home, as it can put you in a vulnerable situation. Remember, safety first! Tip 3: Bring a Friend Along Another vital tip to consider is bringing a friend to your first meeting with your online crush. This additional measure adds a layer of security and reassurance, as your friend can offer support and intervene if things become uncomfortable.

We need to determine how this will affect the number of mold spores floating in the air. Step 2: Consider the mold growth process The mold grows through the following steps: a spore floats through the air, lands on the bread, grows hyphae into the bread, forms a colony, grows sporangiophores, and releases spores into the air. Step 3: Consider the airtight container Since the mold is growing inside an airtight container, the release of new mold spores from the growing colony will be confined to the container. Step 4: Evaluate the effect on mold spores in the air Given that the mold spores released by the colony within the airtight container remain trapped inside it, fewer mold spores from this particular source will be floating in the ambient air.

At a formal ball in Washington D.C., U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) meets a young woman, Susan Atwell (Sean Young). The two immediately begin an affair when they have quick sex in the backseat of Farrell's limosine and later at Susan's apartment. Although Farrell is clearly in love, it is implied that Susan is involved with someone else.During his next Naval deployment to the Phillippines, Farrell rescues a sailor from his ship during a storm and becomes a hero. He is brought back to Washington to work at the Pentagon in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman) is aware that his General Counsel Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) is an old friend of Farrell's. Brice is attempting to cancel a white elephant \\"Phantom Sub\\" project that has powerful political backing. Brice decides that Farrell should act as his direct liaison to the CIA. The real purpose is to gather information about whether the Soviets really are working on such a project.Soon after, Farrell finds out that the other man in Susan's life is Secretary Brice. However, Brice in turn learns of Susan's infidelity. While demanding the name of her new lover, he slaps Susan in a jealous rage and fatally knocks her off an indoor balcony.Ready to turn himself in, Brice is persuaded by Pritchard to cover up everything and blame it on someone else. They concoct a story that claims Susan's other lover was in fact a KGB sleeper agent code-named \\"Yuri.\\" In the aftermath, they focus all attention on an attempt to capture him. Confident that \\"Yuri\\" doesn't exist, Director of Central Intelligence Marshall (Fred Dalton Thompson) dismisses the possibility of it being Pritchard having an affair with Susan, saying that Pritchard is homosexual.Brice appoints the unknowing Farrell to lead the investigation to find Susan's other lover; the KGB spy. Farrell is thus placed in the position of attempting to find evidence that could falsely implicate himself. The only forensic evidence in the case is a badly damaged Polaroid negative recovered from Susan's house, which requires lengthy computerized processing to become visible. Aware that it is his face on the blurred photo, Farrell pleads with systems analyst Sam Hesselman, an old friend, to slow down the processing and confides in him about his secret affair with Susan Atwell. While the processing takes place, Farrell sets about re-directing attention back onto Brice. He does this by searching government printouts for evidence that Brice gave Susan a present which was a government-registered gift from Morocco.Pritchard harasses Nina Beka, a close friend of Susan's, by threatening deportation back to South Africa. Then he sends covert assassins to \\"take care of\\" her. Farrell comes to Nina's rescue just in time.A suspicious Sam goes to Pritchard with concerns about what Farrell told him. Realizing that Sam can implicate Brice, Pritchard shoots him in cold blood.A race develops between two pieces of evidence: the processing of the picture implicating Farrell and a printout of the gift's registration implicating Secretary Brice. Farrell obtains the printout first and confronts Brice with the evidence. Brice shifts the blame to Pritchard, arguing that Pritchard was jealous of his relationship with Susan. A devastated Pritchard commits suicide with a pistol right there in his office. When the military police enter, the guilt-ridden Brice then turns himself in as being the one who killed Susan Atwell and that her KGB lover never existed.The film ends with a surprising plot twist. Several days later, Farrell is mourning at Susan's grave when two plainclothes men arrive and take him away for questioning to a local hotel where another man emerges from behind a two-way mirror. The interrogator is Farrell's landlord Mr. Schiller (Michael Shillo). After a few moments, he addresses Farrell in Russian and Farrell responds in kind. Farrell is, in fact, the real \\"Yuri,\\" and his landlord is his KGB supervisor and handler. Yuri/Farrell was planted in the U.S.A. as a teenager and became the \\"mole\\" in the Department of Defense this whole time. As the KGB was aware of Brice's affair, Farrell was assigned to seduce Atwell and gather intelligence from the Secretary of Defense's mistress. Although his handlers demand that he return to the Soviet Union immediately since his cover was nearly blown, Farrell refuses and leaves. The KGB agents are about to chase after him when Schiller stops them and tells them to let Farrell go for the time being. Schiller quips: \\"He'll be back.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, Mervyn LeRoy and Nicholas Ray are both American film directors who have made significant contributions to the world of cinema during their respective careers, shaping the industry and inspiring many future filmmakers. Each director has a unique filmmaking style, and their work has left an indelible mark on the history of American cinema. Mervyn LeRoy (1900-1987) was an acclaimed American film director, producer, and occasional actor, who is best remembered for his work during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Born in San Francisco, California, LeRoy established himself as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry with an extensive career that spanned nearly five decades. He directed over 75 films, earning numerous accolades and earning a reputation as a versatile filmmaker who could adeptly handle various genres, from crime dramas and musicals to war films and biographies. LeRoy's most notable work includes the classic gangster film \\"Little Caesar\\" (1931), which starred Edward G. Robinson and helped solidify the genre's conventions. He also directed the highly successful musical \\"Gold Diggers of 1933\\" (1933) and the iconic drama \\"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\\" (1932), which challenged the injustices of the American prison system. Perhaps his most famous accomplishment, however, is the beloved film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (1939), which he produced. LeRoy's influence on the American film industry is undeniable, as his work helped shape the course of cinema and left a lasting impression on audiences worldwide. Nicholas Ray (1911-1979) was another influential American film director, renowned for his innovative visual style and distinctive storytelling techniques. Born in Galesville, Wisconsin, Ray studied architecture under the legendary Frank Lloyd Wright before entering the world of film. His background in architecture shaped his unique approach to filmmaking, in which he often manipulated spatial relationships to create tension and emotional impact. Ray's directorial career took off in the 1940s as he gained recognition for his film-noir classic \\"They Live by Night\\" (1948), which featured groundbreaking use of helicopter shots and atmospheric lighting. Known for his exploration of themes like alienation and rebelliousness, Ray went on to direct many influential films, including the noir thriller \\"In a Lonely Place\\" (1950) with Humphrey Bogart and the western \\"Johnny Guitar\\" (1954), starring Joan Crawford. Ray's most famous work is undoubtedly \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" (1955), which starred James Dean and Natalie Wood and became a cultural touchstone for its poignant portrayal of teenage angst and rebellion in postwar America. In conclusion, Mervyn LeRoy and Nicholas Ray were both American film directors who made significant contributions to the world of cinema. While their styles and thematic focuses varied, the impact of their work on the American film industry and the broader landscape of cinema cannot be overstated. Their careers, spanning nearly five decades each, showcase the breadth of their talents and solidify their places as influential figures in the history of American filmmaking."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As the situation in Iraq escalates, the U.S. finds itself awkwardly aligned with a country once vilified as part of the \\"Axis of Evil.\\" While Iraq loses control of its western border to ISIS rebels, the U.S. decides to pragmatically turn to its geopolitical interests to calm this disaster. The unlikely result is Iran sending military weaponry and planes -- including Russian combat jets -- across the Iranian border to aid the Iraqi national army. This shift in alliance seemed implausible a few years ago, but since President Hassan Rouhani took office last year tensions between the U.S. and Iran have slowly and cautiously thawed. While Iraq plummets into further chaos and fragmentation -- the Kurds are expected to vote for full autonomy in an impending referendum -- improvement in U.S-Iran relations may be the only silver-lining in this otherwise catastrophic affair.

Here is a news article: Now that he's been formally sentenced to death, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will soon become a resident of federal death row, joining 61 other killers who've been condemned to die by lethal injection at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. There he will wait — likely for a very long time. Just how long depends on a range of factors, mainly the strength of his legal appeals and the future of lethal injection drugs. But it's safe to assume that it will be several years before he is put to death. Despite the name, there isn't much death on death row. ||||| At 21, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is about to become the youngest, most notorious inmate on federal death row. After convicting the Russian immigrant last month in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a jury on Friday voted to sentence him to death for his role in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11. When Tsarnaev is formally sentenced this summer, it may be the last time he is seen in public, but the legal battle over his case is certain to drag on for years before any execution is carried out. For now he remains in the custody of U.S. marshals here in Boston. After sentencing, he will be turned over to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and eventually deposited at the death house in Terre Haute, Ind., on the banks of the Wabash River. From there, over the next 10 years or more, his defense team will wage the final fight for his life. His current defense lawyers, led by widely known anti-death-penalty advocate Judy Clarke, failed to persuade jurors to spare Tsarnaev from death row. The next legal battle will be with a new team of appellate lawyers who will try to win, at a minimum, a new hearing on whether life with no parole is the more appropriate punishment. \\"It will be a very slow, torturous process,\\" said Charles Ewing, a University at Buffalo law professor. Interviews with several attorneys and experts on capital litigation suggest there is little chance Tsarnaev will see his conviction set aside. In March, on the first day of his trial, Clarke conceded to the jury that Tsarnaev placed one of the two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line in April 2013 that helped kill three people and injure more than 260 others. He and his older brother, Tamerlan, later shot to death an MIT police officer. But experts say Tsarnaev does have a reasonably good chance of getting the death sentence set aside, based largely on his lawyers' repeated requests to move the trial out of Boston. The defense contended for months last year that the Boston community was too deeply scarred and that no local jury could give him a fair and impartial trial. The judge refused to hold a hearing on the matter, and a local appellate court declined to intervene. It will easily be a decade before the death sentence is even carried out. People looking for closure are not going to get it. — Charles Ewing, University at Buffalo law professor The Tsarnaev appellate team also may have a shot at vacating the death sentence if they can show the judge did not properly instruct the jurors, specifically in not telling them that if they deadlocked it would not result in a new trial. A deadlock would have meant a life sentence, but some jurors may not have understood that. \\"The best would be to get him a new punishment phase,\\" said John Blume, a Cornell University law professor and director of the school's Death Penalty Project. \\"There have been other cases that sometimes produce a death sentence because some jurors were leaning toward life and the other jurors beat them up [verbally] and said, 'If we don't do this, if we don't do our duty and give him death, another jury will have to listen to this brutal, gory testimony.'\\" Tsarnaev's appellate lawyers also could challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and question whether his trial attorneys performed effectively. But most lawyers watching the case praised Clarke's decision to admit his guilt, saying such honesty was probably appreciated by the jury. Because this is a federal death penalty case, an appeal is automatic. It begins with an initial request to the judge for a new trial. It ends years later, when the execution date is near, with a plea to the president for commutation. The formal sentencing hearing is expected within about two months, and because the judge cannot reduce the sentence, much of that proceeding will be courtroom theater. Prosecutors said they are reviewing lists of survivors and relatives of the dead to choose which ones will offer victim impact testimony. From the bench, Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. could have harsh words for Tsarnaev when he formally imposes the death sentence. And Tsarnaev, who did not testify at his trial and has shown no public remorse, would have one last opportunity to speak. But whatever he would say would not change the outcome and could, experts said, harm his future appeals. \\"It's up to him, but I don't recommend it,\\" said Andrew Flier, a Los Angeles-area criminal defense lawyer who earlier served as a prosecutor. \\"There's no benefit to it. If he's sorry, he should have said it sooner.\\" According to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based policy group that tracks capital punishment, there were 61 inmates on federal death row as of March 24. Since the reinstatement of the federal death penalty in 1988, 74 defendants have been sentenced to death, and three have been executed. Through legal appeals, 10 others have been transferred off death row. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was convicted in 1997 and executed in 2001. He had a short time on death row because he dropped all appeals and asked to be put to death. The last federal execution was in 2003, when decorated 1991 Gulf War veteran Louis Jones Jr. was executed for killing a young female recruit. Three inmates — members of a violent Richmond, Va., street gang — have been on death row since 1993, another sign of the slow, winding process from the courtroom to the death chamber. The process is filled with legal appeals, psychological examinations, DNA testing, the search for new evidence and other twists as defense lawyers try anything to keep their clients from that trip to the chamber. The process can be particularly difficult for victims who want to get past the constant reminders, and was one reason many in Boston preferred a life sentence over death. With a life sentence, they argued, Tsarnaev would be locked away and forgotten. \\"It will easily be a decade before the death sentence is even carried out,\\" Ewing said. \\"People looking for closure are not going to get it. When it eventually happens, this will be way out of people's consciousness.\\" richard.serrano@latimes.com Twitter: @Rick.SerranoLAT ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A man named Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did something very bad when he placed a bomb at the Boston Marathon in 2013.

This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Answer this question please: Which city is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first? A:","completion":"Based on the background and situation given, Dapperton, the city that relies on nuclear power for its electricity needs, is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first. This is because radioactive elements used in nuclear power generation, such as uranium and plutonium, are relatively rare and limited compared to fossil fuels like coal. While both fossil fuels and radioactive elements are finite resources, the abundance and availability of coal is generally higher than that of radioactive elements. In the U.S., coal reserves are vast and can potentially last for many decades, if not centuries, with advanced mining technologies and efficient utilization. On the other hand, the global supply of radioactive elements necessary for nuclear fission is comparatively scarce, and their extraction and processing can be more complex and costly. However, it's essential to consider the environmental impact of both energy sources. While Dapperton may run out of nuclear fuel sooner, it does not release air pollution or contribute to other environmental issues like acid rain and global warming typically associated with burning fossil fuels, such as coal used in Jamestown. This aspect aligns with Jennifer's values as a strong environmentalist, and she may prioritize the city's energy source's environmental impact over its longevity. In conclusion, Dapperton is more likely to run out of the material used to generate electricity first due to the rarity and limited availability of radioactive elements. However, its environmental advantages over burning fossil fuels might make it a more appealing option for Jennifer, despite the potential issues with resource scarcity."},{"prompt":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Article:Half a century on, consumers are used to a range of convenient ways to pay, but back in 1966 there was a feeling of change when people tried to brandish their exciting new plastic cards. \\"When it arrived I didn't really know what it was,\\" admits Liz Hodgkinson, who was a fresh-faced 22-year-old just out of university. The company sent out some 1.25 million plastic cards to Barclays customers from 29 June 1966 and while some sent them back or never used them, many, like Liz, a writer, embraced the new way of paying. \\"There was an explanatory letter from Barclays which said it was issuing the cards to its best customers. It was a terrific revolution as far as women were concerned as previously you had to have a male guarantor to get credit.\\" At the time, the bank said: \\"[Barclaycard's] purpose is to reduce the use of cash in shopping and other transactions and the scheme is designed to appeal not only to those who must travel and spend a good deal of money in restaurants, but also to the everyday shopper throughout the country.\\" It also stressed the benefits to retailers and businesses by pointing out that the card would help in \\"reducing or eliminating the book-keeping now needed to maintain customers' credit accounts.\\" Once she'd worked out its advantages, Liz used her card as soon as possible. \\"I realised that I could buy something without having to pay for it there and then and could have three weeks' grace. It meant I didn't have to wait until payday. \\"It made me feel very special. My husband banked at Lloyds at the time so didn't get one.\\" In fact it took Barclays' High Street rivals six years to respond. By the time a group comprising Lloyds, NatWest and Midland (now HSBC) launched the now-scrapped Access card in 1972, there were 1.7 million Barclaycard holders. Today the company says it has 10.5 million consumer customers as well as many more business customers. In the intervening period, the world of plastic cards has changed completely. In 1966 Barclaycard charged an annual interest rate of 1.5% but expected payment by the end of the month. The idea of revolving credit, where a card can be used to maintain a longer borrowing, only started in 1967 when Barclaycard offered up to three months' credit. Now, of course, it's possible to be in debt to a credit card for a lifetime and the average interest charged on outstanding balances is 18.9%. The borrowing limits in 1966 were much more modest, too. Cardholders were offered up to £100 worth of credit. Now the average is around £4,000, the company says. Looking ahead, plastic cards will take over from cash to become the UK's most frequently used payment method by 2021, reckons Payment UK. The growth will be driven by \\"the next generation of account holders\\", says the UK Cards Association as \\"younger people are more likely to embrace new technologies such as contactless cards and mobile payments.\\" But the older generation is getting in on the act, too. Liz Hodgkinson, now 72, reveals: \\"I have an app on my phone to make contactless payments,\\" although she admits: \\"It was set up by my grandson!\\" While the introduction of plastic in 1966 may have given cardholders like Liz a feeling of confidence, the evolution of the credit card also meant the danger of getting into debt very much became a reality. \\"I was elated to get an Access card when I was aged 18,\\" says Karen Wake, 55, a pension expert. But her happiness didn't last. \\"By the age of 25 I had built up £30,000 worth of debt. \\"I worked hard to pay it off in five to six years and have had no debt since then,\\" she says. \\"Despite the fact I now work in the financial services industry, that didn't equip me to manage my finances at a young age.\\" Today, many people happily use credit cards for convenience - often earning rewards or cashback - while paying the balance off every month to ensure there are no charges. But overspending and building up long-term debt remain big problems. Mike O'Connor, chief executive of the debt charity Step Change, says: \\"The average credit card debt we see is £8,403 and last year we dealt with more than 200,000 people with £1.7bn of credit card debts.\\" He says the Financial Conduct Authority should reform the market to ensure that credit cards work better for consumers, especially those in financial difficulty. \\"Small changes to existing rules, such as increasing minimum payments from 1% to 2% of the balance or fixing minimum repayments so that they don't fall as the balance declines, could save people thousands of pound and cut years off repayment periods,\\" says Mr O'Connor. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"A long time ago, in 1966, people only used cash to buy things.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Living Will is intended to convey your instructions for life-sustaining medical treatment in the event of a terminal illness or serious accident. It names someone to serve as your agent. This person, often a spouse or family member, consults the information provided in the documents and makes decisions about your care. Without a Living Will, you risk having decisions about your medical treatment made without consultation. This includes starting, maintaining, and ending life support systems, even if the person in control knows that the decision is against your wishes. Without a Living Will, your family members and loved ones may disagree about the right course of action in an emergency. Often, it is easier for people to make life and death decisions when they are guided by your wishes in a Living Will. It also reduces the stress on loved ones at an already stressful time. Additionally, your wishes are more likely to be followed and respected by your loved ones if they have guidance in writing. A Living Will is not the same as a Last Will and Testament. The Living Will does not provide instructions for any disposition of your property after your death, with the exception of organ donation. Living Wills also do not cover every situation. For example, you may need treatment that is not contemplated by your Living Will. In this situation, you will need an agent appointed by a Medical Power of Attorney to make medical decisions for you when you are incapacitated. In addition to a Living Will, you should also create a Medical Power of Attorney (also called a “Healthcare Power of Attorney”). With this legal document, you will appoint someone to make medical decisions for you should you become incapacitated. Whereas a Living Will only applies if you are in a terminal condition, a Medical Power of Attorney will apply so long as you are incapacitated. In the Medical Power of Attorney, you appoint an agent who can consent, refuse, or withdraw consent for any type of medical care or procedure. For more information on medical power of attorney, consult wikiHow’s How to Write a Medical Power of Attorney. POLST programs are designed to assure that the medical treatment wishes you express are honored by health care professionals as you move from one health care setting to another. They are available in about a dozen states. POLST programs are helpful if the health care workers do not have access to your Living Will, or if your Living Will is not specific enough to envision the different treatments that you may or may not want. POLST can substitute for a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. With a DNR, you can state that you do not want CPR. However, a POLST is much broader and also states your wishes with respect to intubation, antibiotic use, and feeding tubes. Doctors sometimes will also ignore a Living Will. For this reason you should create a POLST, if one is available in your state. To make sure that your wishes are carried out, you will need a Living Will, a Medical Power of Attorney, and a POLST. All are necessary, especially if you are facing an imminent end-of-life situation. Summary:","completion":"A Living Will is a special paper that tells people what to do if you get really sick and can't talk to them. It helps you pick someone, like a family member, who can make choices about how to take care of you when you can't do it yourself. This way, people know what you want, even if you can't tell them. There are other papers too, like a Medical Power of Attorney, that help with different choices if you get sick. Sometimes, there's another paper called POLST, which can tell doctors more about what you want if things get really bad. It's important to have these papers so that people know what to do and how to take care of you, just in case something happens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Image copyright AFP Volkswagen has overtaken Toyota to become the world's best-selling carmaker, the first time the German company has held the position. Japan's Toyota, which had topped sales for the past four years, sold 10.175 million vehicles globally in 2016. That fell short of the 10.31 million sales which VW reported last week. The milestone comes despite VW's scandal over emissions tests cheating, which sparked a global backlash and multiple lawsuits. A spokesman for VW said: \\"2016 was a very challenging year for us.\\" The company \\"made strides in resolving and overcoming the diesel crisis\\" and initiated fundamental change in the company's long-term strategy, he said. \\"Nonetheless, we managed to stabilise operating business in difficult conditions: the fact that we handed over more than 10 million vehicles to customers last year bolsters the group and its brands as we head for the future,\\" he added. Image copyright Reuters Volkswagen, which makes the Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, saw a 3.8% increase in sales buoyed by demand in China. And it has been making inroads in other markets too. In Sweden for example, the Volkswagen Golf was the most popular new car in 2016 - the first time in more than half a century that a Volvo hadn't topped the country's sales. Toyota's sales grew by 0.2% - though it appears to have suffered from a slowdown in the US car industry. General Motors reports its figures next week, but it is expected to lag both the Japanese and the German firms. GM was the world's third-largest carmaker in 2015. It held the number one title in 2011 after Toyota's production was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan. ||||| Volkswagen AG dethroned Toyota Motor Corp. last year to become the world’s best-selling automaker for the first time, propelled by surging demand in China which has been largely unaffected by the diesel-cheating scandal. Volkswagen sold a record 10.3 million vehicles in 2016, outpacing its rival with a 3.8 percent gain from a year earlier. Toyota’s global sales, including its Hino Motors Ltd. and Daihatsu Motor Co. units, rose 0.2 percent to 10.2 million vehicles in 2016, the Japanese automaker said on Monday. Taking the global sales crown marks the bittersweet culmination of an aggressive expansion that former Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn kick-started 10 years ago. While surging demand in China and the popularity of the upscale Audi and Porsche brands’ lineups boosted worldwide deliveries, the VW marque lost market share in Europe, its second-biggest region, following revelations in 2015 that the company manipulated diesel engines to pass emissions tests. VW group deliveries last year rose 12.2 percent in China, where the scandal is a non-issue because the automaker sells almost no diesel vehicles there. Sales in Europe gained 4 percent, less than the overall sector, while the crisis fallout hurt demand in the U.S. and recessions cut sales in Russia and South America. The increase in sales tax on small-engine vehicles is set to weigh on deliveries this year in China, Volkswagen’s biggest national market, while in Germany, its home country, the namesake VW brand has started scaling back its large leasing fleet for employees, slowing growth. The marque accounted for almost 6 million of global group deliveries last year, and it’s targeting more than 3 million car sales in China this year. Threat Looms Toyota’s sales last year lagged behind Volkswagen mainly due to its performance in the U.S. and China, with demand for its flagship Camry sedan waning in the U.S. and sales in China expanding at a slower pace than the overall market. Looking ahead, Toyota must contend with possible trade tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump pressures foreign automakers to make more cars and trucks in the U.S. “The development of the U.S. market is set to decide if VW can stay ahead of Toyota this year,” Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG, said by phone. “If the Chinese and European markets continue to be solid and the U.S. market weakens as I expect, VW might stay first in 2017 as Toyota has a larger exposure to North America.” Read more: Why Trump’s ‘Big Border Tax’ Gets Taken Seriously: QuickTake Q&A Since his inauguration, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, reaffirmed a campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement involving Mexico and met with automakers to persuade them to keep production within the U.S. Toyota will invest 10 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, maintaining its pace of spending during the last half decade, joining other manufacturers with highlighting projects in response to pressure from Trump to create jobs in America. After criticizing Toyota’s plans to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, Trump rebuked Japan last week for sending the U.S. hundreds of thousands of cars from what he said were “the biggest ships I’ve ever seen.” VW Restructuring “Trump is a bigger risk for Toyota than for Volkswagen because the German carmaker has a small exposure to the U.S. market,” said Ken Miyao, an analyst at Tokyo-based market researcher Carnorama. “Toyota has made investment to build a new plant in Mexico and will have limited options to appeal to Trump.” As part of a far-reaching overhaul under new division chief Herbert Diess, the VW brand has embarked on a restructuring push outside China and will boost its lineup of sport utility vehicles, the industry’s fastest-growing segment, where it lags behind Toyota and General Motors. Growth in China in recent years had masked weak returns in Europe and an ill-fated product strategy in Brazil, a former VW stronghold. In a U.S. comeback push, it’s rolling out the Atlas mid-size SUV and smaller Tiguan crossover with a longer wheelbase. The VW brand in Europe still largely depends on the Golf hatchback and Passat sedan and station wagon, models in market segments that are being squeezed as customers shift to SUVs. It has revamped the Golf to stabilize sales, and that vehicle’s decline has been partly offset by surging demand for the updated Tiguan SUV. VW executives have become tight-lipped about sales-volume targets as the company’s focus shifts toward safeguarding profits and preparing for a future where vehicle ownership becomes less relevant as ride-hailing and car-sharing gain in popularity. “Our new strategy through 2025 doesn’t include any sales targets any more,” Dietmar Voggenreiter, sales chief at VW’s premium-car unit Audi said in an interview this month. “These times are over.” — With assistance by Masatsugu Horie ||||| TOKYO—Toyota Motor Corp. is no longer the world’s largest car maker by vehicle sales, relinquishing a title held since 2012.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Electrical signals in the brain travel through nerves to muscles - Two types of proteins exist in filaments in the muscles - The filaments move when the brain instructs them to - The motion of the filaments cause the muscle to shorten and contract - Opposing pairs of muscles exist in order to provide the necessary range of motion. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more exercise occurs happens, how will it affect muscles contracting MORE INTENSELY. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose suggests that if more exercise occurs, it will affect the intensity of muscle contractions. To address this hypothesis, let's break down the process of muscle contractions and the potential impacts of increased exercise on this process. Muscle contractions occur through a series of steps: 1. Electrical signals in the brain are generated and then travel through nerves to muscles. 2. There are two types of proteins, actin and myosin, present in the form of filaments within muscle fibers. 3. When the brain sends a signal to the muscle, the myosin filaments \\"grab\\" onto the actin filaments using molecular \\"hooks\\" and then pull, causing the filaments to slide past one another. 4. This sliding action shortens the overall length of the muscle fiber, resulting in muscle contraction. 5. To achieve a full range of motion, muscles work in opposing pairs; when one muscle contracts, the opposing muscle relaxes, allowing for movement in the opposite direction. Now, let's discuss how increased exercise could impact the intensity of muscle contractions. Exercise can lead to several adaptations within muscle fibers, which can ultimately affect the process of contraction: 1. Hypertrophy: More exercise can cause muscle fibers to increase in size, known as hypertrophy. This means that there are more actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers, enhancing the force-generating capacity of the muscle during contraction. 2. Improved neuromuscular efficiency: With regular exercise, the nervous system becomes more efficient at activating motor units (group of muscle fibers activated by a single nerve). This improved efficiency results in better recruitment of muscle fibers, increasing the force of muscle contractions. 3. Increased capillary density: Exercise stimulates the growth of new blood vessels (capillaries) in the muscles. This increased capillary density helps deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscle more effectively, improving muscle contraction efficiency and reducing muscle fatigue during exercise. 4. Enhanced metabolic capacity: Regular exercise increases the number of mitochondria in muscle cells, which are responsible for producing energy. This improves the overall metabolic capacity of the muscle, enabling the muscles to contract more intensely during exercise. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased exercise can directly and indirectly affect the process of muscle contraction. More exercise can lead to physiological adaptations within the muscle, which in turn improve muscle force generation and contraction intensity. This means that as a result of increased exercise, muscles will be able to contract more forcefully and efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: The Music Man Context: The movie opens with a number of traveling salesmen in a railroad car in 1912, lamenting the things that are making their livelihood difficult--changes in society and the economy, and dishonest salesmen who give them a bad name. They are particularly scornful of a certain \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically. Harold also mentions that he'll be in town longer than his usual stretch, a week, because not only will he con the town into buying the instruments, but also uniforms, which will take several weeks to arrive. Marcellus still sees the scheme as a very risky one.The mayor's wife, Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn (Hermione... Answer:","completion":"Before Hill can disappear, he needs to successfully execute his con in the small town of River City, Iowa. This involves several steps: 1. Establish credibility: Hill must establish himself as a reputable and trustworthy figure, this is usually done by introducing himself as \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill and presenting himself as an expert in music. 2. Identify a problem and present a solution: Hill creates a sense of urgency regarding the lack of cultural and musical opportunities for the town's youth. He then proposes the formation of a boys' band as an avenue for personal development, promising that he will not only provide musical instruments and instruction books but also teach the children how to play and form a band. 3. Build interest and excitement: Hill generates enthusiasm among the townspeople for the idea of having a boys' band by elaborating on the benefits it will bring, both to the young members and the community as a whole. He uses persuasive tactics and catchy songs to rally support. 4. Collect money: Hill capitalizes on the excitement, collecting money from the townspeople to purchase the musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms. 5. Avoid suspicion: During his time in River City, Hill needs to navigate potential roadblocks and suspicions, particularly from the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo. He engages her both professionally and romantically to divert her attention and potentially discredit her should she raise doubts about his intentions. 6. Delay the delivery of uniforms: Hill makes it known that the uniforms will take several weeks to arrive, buying extra time for his con to play out and allowing him to stay in town longer without arousing suspicion. 7. Escape before being exposed: Once the money has been collected and Hill has achieved as much as possible from the con without being caught, he will ultimately plan to slip away from River City before the townspeople realize they have been swindled. By following these steps and successfully executing the con, Hill aims to deceive the people of River City before disappearing and moving on to his next target town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","completion":"Uncle Sam is the one who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's first delve into the mechanism of statin drugs and their connection with HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are a class of drugs that effectively reduce blood cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By blocking HMG-CoA reductase, statins lower the production of cholesterol, which in turn reduces the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and stroke. Therefore, lowering LDL cholesterol levels is a key goal in managing high cholesterol. When statin drugs decrease the production of cholesterol, it results in an increased expression of LDL receptors in the liver. These receptors help in the uptake and clearance of LDL from the bloodstream, thereby reducing the amount of circulating cholesterol. This process ultimately reduces the risk of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the build-up of plaque in the arterial walls, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Now, it's important to understand that individuals respond differently to statin therapy due to their unique genetic makeup. Pharmacogenomics, the study of the interaction between drugs and genetics, can help explain such variation in response. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are variations in the DNA sequence at a specific location, can affect the way a person responds to statin drugs. In some individuals, their genetic background may cause a significant reduction in cholesterol levels when using statins, while in others, the reduction may be moderate or negligible. This variation highlights the necessity to personalize treatment options by taking into consideration an individual's unique genetic profile. Through pharmacogenomics, healthcare providers can better understand how different people might metabolize and respond to statins, and consequently, make informed decisions about the appropriate medication and dosage to optimize treatment outcomes. In summary, based on the information provided, Uncle Sam is the uncle who doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, as he is not on statin drugs. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom, who is on statin drugs, benefits from the cholesterol-lowering effects of these medications. The differences in their responses to statins can be attributed to their genetic makeup and can be better understood through the study of pharmacogenomics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every day, in any high school, peer pressure has a major influence over the behavior of teenagers. It can be as subtle as being persuaded to be late for class or as extreme as a dangerous drug. Whether subtle or extreme, peer pressure can have damaging, sometimes life changing, and even serious results. \\"Teens don't often consider the long-term results that some behavior can cause,\\" said Terri Price, a researcher. \\"Peer pressure can be very difficult to handle for many teens because of their fears of not fitting in\\". Peer pressure has always been part of teen life, but teens experience _ differently than their former generations did in the past. Sources of peer pressure have increased because of the Internet and other electronic communications. Recognizing peer pressure can be as simple as noticing that you have been asked to do something that you are not comfortable with. \\"Listen to your instinct , which is a sign for whether something is right or wrong. If it feels wrong, then most likely it is. \\"says Price. Teens are in a time of life when they are still discovering who they are. Many teens are influenced by peer pressure because of their insecurities . This can make them helpless especially when their self-control is weak or they lack healthy support, causing them to take risky behavior or turn to unhealthy support.

Plot title: Men of Honor Movie plot: Carl Brashear (Gooding, Jr.) leaves his native Kentucky and the life of a sharecropper in 1948 by joining the United States Navy. As a crew member of the salvage ship USS Hoist, where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, Master Chief Petty Officer Leslie William \\"Billy\\" Sunday (De Niro). He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails. Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass. The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him.\\" if \\"A man is playing at a concert with his band.\\"?","completion":"It is not definitive to conclude that \\"A man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him\\" just by knowing that \\"A man is playing at a concert with his band.\\" There are various factors and possibilities to consider before making such a conclusion. Firstly, it's important to explore the possible roles within a band: 1. Vocals: The man could be the lead singer, and he might not necessarily play the guitar. He could be singing while standing, sitting, or engaging in different stage activities. 2. Guitar: The man in question could be playing the guitar, which could involve playing an electric guitar or an acoustic guitar. However, the original statement does not specify if he is playing while standing up or sitting down. 3. Bass: He could be a bass guitar player, again playing either in a standing or sitting position. 4. Drums: The man might be the drummer of the band. In such a scenario, he'd likely be sitting down. 5. Keyboard: The man could be a keyboard or piano player, either standing or sitting while playing. 6. Other instruments: There are various other possibilities in which the man could be playing other instruments, such as saxophone, trumpet, or even percussion. In addition, the presence of a microphone is not guaranteed for every performer. Microphones could be used exclusively for vocalists or for specific musical instruments to enhance the sound. In some cases (e.g., for a drummer), a microphone might not be directly in front of them. Moreover, the man's position (either standing or sitting) while performing is also not conclusive in the given statement. Musicians have personal preferences and varying stage setups, which can lead to distinct ways of performing on stage. In conclusion, while it is possible that \\"a man is standing while playing a guitar with a microphone in front of him\\" given the information that \\"a man is playing at a concert with his band,\\" detailed information about his role within the band, instrument being played, and stage setup are essential to make a conclusive determination.

The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the 2008 Olympiad will start to recruit volunteers on August 28. The Olympics will need around 70,000 volunteers and the Paralympic Games will need another 30,000. University students like Xue will make up the majority of the volunteers. But the Olympics also need other volunteers - ordinary citizens and foreigners, for example. Students in Beijing should apply through their universities. Other volunteers may apply online or submit a written application. The online application system and a hotline will be open next Monday. For applicants outside Beijing, the application process begins in December. There is plenty of work for volunteers to do. For example, there will be chances to help publicize the games over the next two years. During the games themselves, volunteers will clean, serve food, marshal or offer language help. The Sydney Olympics in 2000 was the first that placed special emphasis on the role of volunteers. It used more than 45,000 volunteers in different roles.

Since they are like terms, we can combine them. 0 = (-1 - 3)*u - 4 By combining the coefficients -1 and -3, we get: 0 = -4*u - 4 Step 2: Isolate the variable u by adding 4 to both sides of the equation. We need to get rid of the constant term -4 on the right side. 0 + 4 = -4*u - 4 + 4 Simplifying the equation gives us: 4 = -4*u Step 3: Solve for u by dividing both sides of the equation by -4.

Risks Lie Ahead as EU Moves to Tackle Debt Crisis There is calm in the euro zone, but also a widespread, though not universal, expectation in the financial markets that more storms lie ahead. On the table at Friday's European Union summit is a package of measures that will expand available bailout funds and make them more useful to stem the onset of a crisis. The price is for the weaker economies to take further measures that over the medium term will reduce the risks of such debt crises emerging in the future. For now, governments are being given the benefit of the doubt: that these measures will deal with the main risks that confront the currency union. But what are these risks? Ireland's election, due on Feb. 25, has put it right back on the risk map. There are now widespread expectations that the terms for Ireland's tough €67.5 billion (93.2 billion) bailout package will be relaxed to give it a chance to repay its heavy debts. But the election has introduced once again the question of how a new government will deal with its battered banking system. Ireland's major opposition parties now say they want the holders of the banks' senior bonds to make a contribution to rescuing the country's banks, a position that contradicts that of the current government, which has pledged that these bondholders will be paid in full. Even though the opposition parties have pledged a negotiation over the bank bonds, such a position could, investors say, have an impact on Ireland's own banks and consequences for banks in the rest of the euro zone. The main danger here is a question of debt sustainability in the medium term, bringing down a sovereign-debt level that is rising past 150% of annual economic output. But official discussions now evidently under way could go a long way toward addressing these concerns—stretching out official debt over 30 years, reducing interest rates and providing the means for Greece to reduce its debts to private bondholders. Will it be enough? Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates insists his country doesn't need a bailout. Whether it takes the official money or not, Portugal may not change the trajectory of the crisis much one way or another. Here the issue is not so much central government debt—still below the euro-zone average despite its big budget deficits—but what the central government might have to do to resolve the problems of the banks. The Spanish authorities have been working hard to increase confidence that they have the problem of their savings banks, or cajas, in hand. A bill in the tens of billions of euros to replenish the capital of these banks looks manageable to some investors now. However, the government must avoid taking over the assets of the banks, in the way that Ireland did. For some euro-zone bears, the region's banks are the most worrying piece of the puzzle. Many are still addicted to European Central Bank funding, while for the region as a whole the banks are as dependent as ever on the wholesale money markets, meaning they are vulnerable to a loss in confidence. In some banks, particular among mutual institutions, capital is low. As in Ireland, the financial health of governments is tied inextricably to that of its banks. The problem is it's possible to believe almost anything because transparency is lacking. Hence, say officials at the European Commission and elsewhere, there is a need for tough and transparent stress tests this year, and credible financing programs to provide new bank capital if it's needed. Some investors say the market is set up for a battle between bears and bulls in the euro zone over the next few months. The outcome will hang on whether governments succeed in developing, without falling out, a package of credible measures to stave of the crisis even as they and the region's banks raise billions of euros in financing from the bond markets. According to Brian Yelvington, director of macro strategy of Knight Capital Americas, LP, a broker-dealer, euro-zone governments will have €315 billion of debt coming due and the region's banks more than €228 billion. The idea that euro-zone authorities could undertake official buybacks of government bonds—as now seems very likely in Greece—has generated anxiety among those buying insurance against possible losses in the market for credit-default swaps. Their concern is that governments could effectively restructure or reschedule their debts through buying bonds back at a discount or exchanging them voluntarily for other bonds with a lower net present value. Such voluntary arrangements wouldn't generate a \\"credit event,\\" says Mr. Yelvington, and so the payouts envisaged under the CDSs wouldn't be triggered. Triggering a CDS \\"event\\" would probably be regarded as \\"unpalatable\\" by euro-zone governments, he says. But one question raised by this minor scare is this: Should governments care?

Take over-the-counter painkillers. Over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers can help to minimize your discomfort by disrupting the production of a specific chemical called prostaglandins, which are responsible for managing pain sensations. Common OTC painkillers include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, but it's essential to follow the recommended dosage and consult with a healthcare professional to ensure you're taking the right medication for your situation. In addition to OTC painkillers, your doctor may recommend other therapies based on the underlying cause of your chronic pelvic pain. They might recommend physical therapy exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and alleviate tension in your pelvic region. Heat therapy, such as using a heating pad or taking a warm bath, can also provide relief. If the pain is severe or persistent, your doctor might consider prescribing stronger pain medications, nerve blocks, or trigger point injections to target specific nerves and muscles in your pelvic region. These measures should only be used on a short-term basis and under the supervision of a healthcare provider to avoid dependency or potential side effects. Alternative and complementary medicine approaches, such as acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and biofeedback, might be explored alongside conventional medical treatments to address chronic pelvic pain. These methods may help you manage the pain more effectively and enhance your overall well-being. Addressing the emotional aspect of chronic pain is equally crucial. Chronic pelvic pain can negatively impact your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and a reduced quality of life. Your healthcare team may suggest counseling, support groups, or other mental health interventions to help you cope with the ongoing pain and its impact on your daily life. This holistic approach ensures that your physical and emotional needs are addressed. In summary, the primary goal when treating chronic pelvic pain is to identify and address the underlying cause. If this isn't possible, healthcare professionals will work to minimize your discomfort, employing various pharmaceutical, physical, and mental therapies.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the people whose 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape? is inside the article: Deep house's origins can be traced to Chicago producer Mr Fingers's relatively jazzy, soulful recordings \\"Mystery of Love\\" (1985) and \\"Can You Feel It?\\" (1986). According to author Richie Unterberger, it moved house music away from its \\"posthuman tendencies back towards the lush\\" soulful sound of early disco music.Acid house arose from Chicago artists' experiments with the squelchy Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, and the style's origins on vinyl is generally cited as Phuture's \\"Acid Tracks\\" (1987). Phuture, a group founded by Nathan \\"DJ Pierre\\" Jones, Earl \\"Spanky\\" Smith Jr., and Herbert \\"Herb J\\" Jackson, is credited with having been the first to use the TB-303 in the house music context. The group's 12-minute \\"Acid Tracks\\" was recorded to tape and was played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Music Box, where Hardy was resident DJ. Hardy once played it four times over the course of an evening until the crowd responded favorably. The track also utilized a Roland TR-707 drum machine. Club play of house tracks by pioneering Chicago DJs such as Hardy and Lil Louis, local dance music record shops such as Importes Etc., State Street Records, Loop Records, Gramaphone Records and the popular Hot Mix 5 shows on radio station WBMX-FM helped popularize house music in Chicago. Later, visiting DJs and producers from Detroit fell into the genre. Trax Records and DJ International Records, Chicago labels with wider distribution, helped popularize house music inside and outside of Chicago. One 1986 house tune called \\"Move Your Body\\" by Marshall Jefferson, taken from the appropriately titled \\"The House Music Anthem\\" EP, became a big hit in Chicago and eventually worldwide. By 1986, UK labels were releasing house music by Chicago acts, and by 1987 house tracks by Chicago DJs and producers were appearing on and topping the UK music chart.

Washington (CNN) -- A competitor of the Coca-Cola Company can bring a private lawsuit against the beverage giant over allegations of false advertising in a juice product, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday. The 8-0 decision is a win for Pom Wonderful, a California-based firm. It claimed Coke's Minute Maid brand was cheating consumers through deceptive labeling in its Pomegranate Blueberry beverage, which the court said \\"in truth ... contains but 0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice.\\" At issue was whether one federal law regulating and enforcing food labeling preempted or overrode efforts by private parties to bring lawsuits under a separate federal law.

He believes that by allowing people to confront their sins directly, they will seek repentance and rediscover their faith, ultimately winning back the love of God. Plot: The story begins when a disillusioned priest, Father Daniel, prays for a miracle to restore hope in a world plagued with corruption, war, and hatred. The Archangel Gabriel hears his plea and devises a plan to transform the human race and make them worthy of God's love once again. With the help of Father Daniel, Gabriel summons the gates of Hell to open, causing demons and lost souls to pour into the Earth. Gabriel believes that if people can witness their darkest fears become reality and confront them directly, they will acknowledge their sins and seek redemption through repentance and faith. As Hell slowly takes over the world, chaos, terror, and destruction ensue. Father Daniel and a group of individuals with wavering faith band together to survive the horrors unleashed upon humanity. Along their journey, they encounter various demonic entities that represent the worst characteristics of mankind, including greed, pride, jealousy, and lust. As the group faces each entity, they become increasingly aware of their own shortcomings and sins, as well as the injustices they had long ignored in society. This includes Rebecca, a materialistic woman who learns the true meaning of selflessness and empathy; Sarah, a skeptic and scientist who grapples with the existence of demons and her faith; and Michael, an ambitious lawyer who must confront the harm he caused in his pursuit of power. As Gabriel's plan takes effect, a revolution of faith and repentance spreads across the globe. People begin to truly repent for their sins, seek forgiveness, and find strength in their newfound faith. As humanity begins to transform, the demons are gradually banished back to Hell. The climax of the story unfolds during an epic battle between Gabriel, Father Daniel, and the group against the final demonic entity, known as The Adversary. The group's success, fueled by their unwavering faith and strength of character, seals the gates of Hell, restoring the balance on Earth. In the end, Gabriel's plan succeeds, as people around the world are transformed, their souls cleansed through repentance and faith – making them once again worthy of God's eternal love. The film concludes with a final scene of Father Daniel giving an impassioned sermon at his church, emphasizing the importance of faith, hope, and love.

The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing any sexual activity. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal. Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, and religious purposes. Whom they marry may be influenced by socially determined rules of incest, prescriptive marriage rules, parental choice and individual desire. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, child marriage, polygamy, and sometimes forced marriage, may be practiced as a cultural tradition. Conversely, such practices may be outlawed and penalized in parts of the world out of concerns for women's rights and because of international law. In developed parts of the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights within marriage for women and legally recognizing the marriages of interfaith or interracial, and same-sex couples. These trends coincide with the broader human rights movement. - Kerala, historically known as Keralam, is an Indian state in South India on the Malabar coast.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

As a former employee, she was able to provide an insider's perspective on the appalling treatment of the animals, including the unnecessary destruction of thousands of creatures. Step 2: Discussing the Impact of Her Revelations on the Charity Organization Her brave act of speaking up against the organization she had once worked for led to widespread outrage and repercussions for the charity. Public opinion quickly turned against them as people began questioning their motives and integrity. Consequently, the charity's reputation was tarnished, and they faced severe backlash. Step 3: Delving into the Circumstances Surrounding Her Death While the specific circumstances of Miss Aubrey-Ward's death are still unclear, her family is convinced that the animal charity's actions contributed to it. They believe that the organization's unethical practices and subsequent fallout had an adverse effect on her emotional and mental wellbeing. It is important to consider the crucial role that whistleblowers can play in unveiling the truth, but the devastating impact it can have on their lives cannot be ignored. Step 4: Addressing the Importance of Accountability in Charitable Organizations This tragic story serves as a stark reminder of the significance of accountability and transparency in charitable organizations. The very purpose of these institutions is to work for the greater good, providing care and protection to those in need, including animals. It is imperative, therefore, that they maintain the highest standards of ethics and integrity in their operations to ensure the public's trust and support. Conclusion: As the case of the late Miss Aubrey-Ward unfolds, it is pertinent to recognize the courage displayed by whistleblowers like her who risk their lives to reveal the hidden truths. In light of this tragedy, it is crucial for all charitable organizations to take responsibility for upholding the highest ethical standards and ensuring that the rights and welfare of their beneficiaries are not compromised. In doing so, we can work together towards a brighter and more compassionate future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Toby refuses to sign his contract unless Max does what? Marry his mother. Answer:","completion":"Title: A Signature Deal Genre: Romantic Comedy Plot: Toby Holland, a talented but eccentric screenwriter, has just finished writing the perfect script for the upcoming blockbuster. The whole industry is buzzing with excitement, and everyone wants to get their hands on the rights to his masterpiece. At the center of the race is Max Johnson, an ambitious but unscrupulous movie producer with a reputation for always getting what he wants. Max reaches out to Toby to buy the rights to his script, knowing that this could be the movie that pushes him to the top of the Hollywood food chain. In a bid to secure the deal, Max invites Toby to a lavish dinner at his mansion. During the dinner, Max is smitten by Toby's widowed mother, Diane, who is also present at the event. Diane is a charming woman in her 50s, but she has had her fair share of heartbreaks and has grown cynical about love and relationships. The next day, Toby agrees to sign the contract with Max on one daring condition - Max has to marry his mother, Diane. Max, who is desperate to secure the rights to Toby's script, agrees to the condition, fully intending to win Diane's heart and then end the marriage after the deal is signed. Max begins courting Diane, pulling out all the stops in an attempt to charm her. Diane, skeptical of Max's intentions, retaliates with her wit and sarcasm every time he tries to win her over. Yet, as Max continues to pursue her, the pair gradually form a deep and genuine connection. As the nuptials loom closer, Toby continues to push harder for the couple to get married. Diane, slowly letting her guard down, starts to feel something for Max that she hasn't felt in a long time. At the same time, Max starts to question his motive behind the marriage. As his love for Diane grows, he starts to feel guilty about originally agreeing to the deal for the sake of Toby's script. On their wedding day, as Diane and Max are about to exchange their vows, Max comes clean about the real reason behind their marriage. Diane, heartbroken and betrayed, runs from the altar, and Toby, feeling like he's lost everything, refuses to sign the contract. But as the dust settles, Max realizes that he is genuinely in love with Diane and tries everything he can to win her back – this time not for the sake of the deal, but for a lifetime of love and happiness. Diane, having forgiven Max, gives their love a second chance, and the two find happiness in being together. In a twist of fate, Toby, realizing the reason Max willingly enters the contract, is touched by his genuine love for his mother. This prompts him to finally sign the contract, allowing Max to produce the movie he'd been dreaming about. The movie ends with a montage of Max and Diane's life together, filled with love, laughter, and companionship, while Max's film, written by Toby, goes on to become a critical and commercial success. Through love and honest intentions, Max, Diane, and Toby have discovered that life's unexpected challenges can lead to the most beautiful of stories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, Misterioso is a hard bop record. The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \\"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition.\\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \\"Nutty\\", Griffin incorporated lines from \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \\"Blues Five Spot\\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" at the end of \\"Blues Five Spot\\". The quartet began \\"In Walked Bud\\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version. It was played as a single chorus repeated at length.The title track—first recorded for Blue Note Records in 1948 with vibraphonist Milt Jackson—is one of Monk's most influential recordings and is...

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of magma formation in the ground. Direct effects: 1. If the massive change in the crust leads to an increase in temperature, it could cause more rock to melt, resulting in an increased amount of magma production. 2. The change in the crust may also alter the composition or location of magma chambers, affecting where magma accumulates and how it rises through the crust. 3. If the perturbation causes a shift in tectonic plates, it could lead to increased volcanic activity as the plates interact and create new pathways for magma to rise to the surface. Indirect effects: 1. The perturbation may cause changes in the Earth's mantle, altering the rate at which the mantle material rises to the crust and forms magma. 2. Changes in the crust could also alter the strength or permeability of the rock, affecting how magma moves through the crust and potentially leading to more or less frequent volcanic eruptions. 3. Massive changes in the crust may lead to increased seismic activity, which can, in turn, have an effect on magma movement and eruption processes. Overall, a massive change in the Earth's crust has the potential to significantly impact the formation, movement, and eruption of magma, both directly and indirectly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: On the previous evening,--March 12th,--the monotony of the camp had been unexpectedly disturbed by the arrival, from the direction of Salt Lake City, of a horseman completely exhausted by fatigue and cold, who proved to be no other than Mr. Kane, whose mission to the Mormons by way of California was at that time totally unknown to the army. The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day. What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results. When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties. To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business. It was evident to everybody, however, that the Mormon leaders, conscious of their inability to resist the force by which they would be assailed so soon as the snow should melt upon the mountains, were engaged in an effort, of which Mr. Kane was the agent, to secure through the Governor, if possible, indemnity for their past offences, in consideration of acknowledgment of his authority.

Israel has halted a plan that would have displaced tens of thousands of Bedouins in the southern part of the country. The controversial plan would have involved destroying \\"unrecognized\\" villages in the Negev, and resettling the displaced Bedouin citizens into \\"recognized\\" villages. Benny Begin, a former lawmaker who helped construct the plan, said Thursday it does not have enough votes in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, to move forward. The Prawer Plan was based on an effort to better integrate Israel's Bedouin population into Israeli society. Following recommendations of a committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan in 2011. The Cabinet also approved more economic development in the Bedouin sector of the Negev, the government said at the time. But the plan to displace Bedouins sparked anger. Last month, Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting. According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would have been affected by the plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000.

Question: \\"What kind of living thing did he use to study inheritance?\\" Context: \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Gregor Mendel used common edible pea plants (Pisum sativum) to study inheritance patterns. He selected this species because they could be easily grown, had a relatively short generation time, and exhibited distinct traits that could be tracked from parent to offspring. Mendel's work with these plants laid the foundation for modern genetics, as he discovered fundamental principles such as independent assortment, dominant and recessive traits, heterozygotes and homozygotes, and discontinuous inheritance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\"?

The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, also called RodeoHouston or abbreviated HLSR, is the largest livestock exhibitions and rodeo in the world. It also includes one of the richest regular-season rodeo events. It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003. It was previously held in the Astrodome. Since 1952, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders. The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston. They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day. Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern. The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail. The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins. The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown. The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Do people ride on horses?","completion":"Yes, people do ride on horses during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo's traditional trail rides.

A production source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the programs will not include 27-year-old Josh Duggar, the oldest of the Duggar siblings and the subject of revelations last May that, as a teenager, had fondled four of his sisters, including Jill and Jessa. More recently he publicly apologized for a pornography addiction and cheating on his wife.

The Duggars are returning to TLC. At least, some of them are. Two months after the Discovery-owned cable channel canceled 19 Kids and Counting over Josh Duggar's sexual molestation admission, TLC has ordered several new specials centered on his two sisters Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard. Production is slated to begin soon for a targeted year-end premiere for at least one of the specials, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. The untitled specials will center on Dillard, her husband, Derick, and their infant son as they prepare to move to El Salvador for missionary work, and Seewald, who is expecting her first child with husband Ben on Nov. 1. Two or three specials are currently planned. Over 19 Kids and Counting's 15-season run, Jill and Jessa became two of the family's most famous members, appearing on magazine covers documenting their engagements, marriages and pregnancies. The series, however, has not aired on TLC since it was canceled in July. The sisters most recently appeared on the channel in August in a special entitled Breaking the Silence that aimed to raise awareness of child sexual abuse nationwide. In May, their brother confessed to having sexually assaulted several underage girls — including two of his sisters — 12 years ago. \\"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,\\" Duggar said in a statement at the time. \\"I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation.\\" He most recently checked himself into rehab in August amid infidelity allegations.

He didn't even own the bloody thing - Keane on the Rock of Gibraltar dispute. I knew Ronaldo would rule the world. Roy Keane has hit out at Manchester United's famous 'class of '92' by saying their importance to the club's dominance of English football has been overstated. United's legendary youth side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 contained the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Phil Neville; all became vital to later success at Old Trafford. The group of players took their story to the silver screen, releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom. But Keane, in his new autobiographyThe Second Half, airs his distaste for the 'brand' of the group. He also uncovered a different side to Scholes, who has always been revered for his squeaky-clean image off the field. 'Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image,' Keane said. 'Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.' (Left to right) Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham as the Class of '92, which Roy Keane says has 'become a brand' According to Keane's new autobiography, The Second Half, Paul Scholes (left) had 'more of an edge to him' than people thought. Keane celebrates with one half of the Class of '92 as Ryan Giggs gives United a 1-0 lead against Juventus in the Champions League in 2003. With almost 4,000 senior matches for United and close to 100 major trophies between them, Beckham and Co clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of Red Devils players since the Busby Babes in the 1950s, but Keane believes the Class of '92 'brand' has slightly overtaken the team's own success in that period. Keane adds: 'The Class of ’92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated. 'The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it. However, the Corkman clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful United youth graduates to date, 'But we all had the same aims. We all had the same hunger.' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Turned down Celtic this summer. Re-opens feud with Fergie. Keane and the Class of '92 became the most successful side in the club's rich history as Ferguson's side completed the Treble in 1999, becoming the first English club to achieve such a feat. The Red Devils went undefeated for 33 games in all competitions before producing the most dramatic of Champions League comebacks against Bayern Munich - a final which Keane was forced to miss through suspension. Speaking about the talented generation, Ferguson said: 'I have been fortunate to work with many exceptional young players, but the Class of 92 was unique. For so many of them to stay together and succeed at the highest level is a great tribute to their talent and this club’s belief in the power of youth. 'I am convinced that no group of players will ever make such an impact on the English game as those boys have done – and continue to do.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

The Queen's Gallery is an art gallery at Buckingham Palace in London, England. It was established in 1962 and showcases art from the Royal Collection, which includes a variety of paintings, sculptures, and other artwork from various periods and artistic styles. This gallery is open to the public and offers guided tours and educational events. It is important to know the history of the site to better understand the context in which the Queen's Gallery was built. World War II had a significant impact on the United Kingdom, with air raids causing widespread destruction across many cities, including London. Many historical sites and buildings were damaged or destroyed during this time, including the chapel that once stood on the site where the Queen's Gallery is now located. In the aftermath of World War II, various reconstruction efforts were undertaken throughout the UK to rebuild and revitalize damaged cities and sites. The decision to construct the Queen's Gallery on the site of the destroyed chapel was likely influenced by the desire to create a space dedicated to the appreciation and preservation of art and culture, as well as to provide a lasting testament to the resilience and determination of the British people in overcoming the challenges of the war.

If the bike is too big, your child won’t be able to reach the pedals, so take her to pick out the bike when you purchase it. To determine if the bike is the right size: Help your child to get on to the bike. Have her stand above the top pipe of the frame with both feet on the ground. If she can do this comfortably, the bike is the appropriate size. Seat height is very important for proper pedaling. Begin by putting the bike seat at its lowest level so that your child can practice pushing the bike (rather than pedalling). Once your child is ready to start pedalling, adjust the seat so that it is consistent with your child’s height. To determine the seat height, make sure that your child can reach the pedal with her whole foot when the pedal is the lowest position. It is very likely that your child will tip over or fall off the bike while she learns how to pedal. Because of this, a helmet is of the utmost importance. Fit the helmet so that when it is strapped to your child’s head, it doesn’t wiggle very much, but is also not glued to your child’s head. The helmet should also sit levelly across your child’s forehead.

Would \\"Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, that would be a reasonable answer. Tofu, also called bean curd, is a food made by coagulating soy juice and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. The process of making tofu involves: 1. Soaking: Soybeans are soaked in water to soften them, which makes it easier to separate their components. This step also helps to hydrate the beans and increase their volume. 2. Grinding: The soaked soybeans are then ground into a smooth paste. This is usually done using a specialized grinder or blender for large-scale production. Smaller-scale tofu makers may use a mortar and pestle or a food processor to achieve a similar result. 3. Cooking: The ground soybean paste is then cooked, usually by boiling, to deactivate enzymes and eliminate any potential harmful components, such as lectins and trypsin inhibitors. This cooking process also helps to improve the flavor, texture, and digestibility of the final product. 4. Extracting Soy Milk: The cooked soybean paste is strained through a fine cloth or sieve to separate the liquid soy milk from the solid residue, known as okara. The resulting soy milk is then typically heated to further improve its quality. 5. Coagulating: Coagulating agents, such as magnesium chloride (nigari), calcium sulfate (gypsum), or glucono delta-lactone (GDL), are added to the heated soy milk. These agents cause the proteins in the soy milk to coagulate, forming curds. 6. Pressing: The curds are then transferred to a mould, usually lined with cheesecloth or a similar material, and pressure is applied to remove excess liquid, or whey. The duration and intensity of the pressing process help to determine the firmness of the final tofu product. 7. Finalizing: Once the desired firmness is achieved, the tofu is removed from the mould and, in some cases, briefly submerged in cold water to firm up its texture. It is then ready to be packaged, sold, and consumed. This entire process results in tofu, a versatile plant-based food product made from soybeans that can be used in a variety of culinary applications."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

To do this, we can add q to both sides of the equation: -q + 5 + q = 0 + q This simplifies the left side of the equation to just the constant: 5 = q Step 3: Write the final answer.

Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Dr. Charles White confirmed they were alive? from the following article ? The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid.

Answer this question: when did pledge of allegiance added under god??","completion":"The phrase \\"under God\\" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, after being approved by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Pledge of Allegiance, originally written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, has gone through a few revisions to reach the current version. The journey to adding \\"under God\\" in the Pledge began during the Cold War era when the United States was experiencing heightened tensions with the Soviet Union. There was a growing concern among Americans about the threat of communism and its impact on the nation's values. The United States wanted to reaffirm the importance of religion and the belief in a higher power as an essential element that separated the nation's value systems from communism, which promoted atheism. In 1951, an organization named Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service group, began to include the words \\"under God\\" in their recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. This effort gained momentum with various religious and civic groups advocating that the Pledge should contain a reference to God. The Reverend George M. Docherty, a Presbyterian minister and pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., played a vital role in this movement. On February 7, 1954, Reverend Docherty delivered a sermon titled \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\" in the presence of President Eisenhower. The sermon emphasized the need to include \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance to highlight the theological foundations of the United States. This idea resonated with Eisenhower, who agreed that the inclusion of \\"under God\\" would differentiate the American democratic system from atheistic communism. Subsequently, Congressman Charles Oakman introduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 8, 1954, to amend the Pledge of Allegiance. A similar bill was proposed in the U.S. Senate by Senator Homer Ferguson. After a series of debates, both houses of Congress unanimously approved the amendment. President Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954, marking the official addition of \\"under God\\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. Since then, the Pledge of Allegiance reads as: \\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\" While the addition of \\"under God\\" to the Pledge has been seen by many as a positive expression of American values and spirituality, it has also been the subject of debates and legal challenges. Critics argue that the phrase in the Pledge could be seen as a violation of the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. Nevertheless, the phrase remains a powerful and lasting part of the Pledge of Allegiance, reflecting a significant period in American history and societal values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are however, areas of knowledge and human experience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral questions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science has cannot investigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and energy, and cannot be observed and measured. The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. Hypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are scientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that scientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories.

In such an environment, using a computer as a tool for learning is highly encouraged and supported. At a school, computers are typically equipped with a wide range of educational software, digital textbooks, and e-learning resources that are vetted and curated by educators. This ensures that the content available on school computers is not only relevant and age-appropriate but also academically accurate and engaging. Additionally, schools often have designated computer labs and libraries where students can access computers and receive guidance from teachers or support staff when needed. These resources may not be available at home or in an apartment, where learners must rely on their own devices and internet connections for research and assignments. Moreover, schools facilitate collaboration and group projects where students can share their knowledge and learn from one another.

We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked.

We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. Given a premise, an initial context, an original ending, and a counterfactual context, the task is to generate a new story ending aligned with the counterfactual context and as close to the original ending as possible. Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context and the story's general plot. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. You should write a new story ending that edits the original story ending as little as possible to regain coherence with the counterfactual context.
