You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Robert Mills Delaney, sometimes incorrectly spelled Delany (1903-1956) was an American composer. He studied with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger in Paris, and was best known for his 1928 choral symphony, John Brown's Song, based on Stephen Benet's Pulitzer Prize winning poem \\"John Brown's Body\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? Robert Mills Delaney composed only one song throughout his lifetime.","completion":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that Robert Mills Delaney composed only one song throughout his lifetime based on the given information. The information provided highlights Delaney's best-known work, the 1928 choral symphony John Brown's Song. However, this does not imply that this was the only song he composed during his career. As a composer, it is highly likely that Delaney had a more diverse and extensive body of work. His studies with prominent figures such as Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger in Paris would have provided him with valuable knowledge and experience in the field of composition. It's reasonable to assume that during his career, he would have composed numerous other pieces, exploring different genres, styles, and forms of music. Moreover, considering the time span from his birth in 1903 to his death in 1956, Delaney had ample time to build a rich musical repertoire. Turning our attention to established composers in general, it is a rare occurrence for them to have composed only one song or piece throughout their entire careers. Composers tend to create various musical pieces over time and continue to develop their skills and techniques, thus contributing to their growth in the world of music. Similarly, it is improbable that Delaney composed merely one song in his lifetime. In conclusion, while the information presented focuses on Delaney's most prominent composition, the choral symphony John Brown's Song, we cannot assume that this was his sole contribution to the world of music. It's important to recognize that composers typically produce many compositions over their careers, and further research on Delaney's works would provide a more accurate representation of his musical legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Available options: (i). coral reefs (ii). rainforest plants (iii). ocean phytoplankton (iv). continental grasslands Answer:","completion":"Answer: (iii). Ocean Phytoplankton Although each of these ecosystems contributes to the production of oxygen on Earth, it is ocean phytoplankton that provides most of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. Phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants that play a vital role in maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide on our planet. They perform photosynthesis, similar to terrestrial plants, where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into oxygen and organic matter. Here is a brief overview of each option and its contribution to Earth's oxygen production: (i) Coral reefs: Coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems characterized by the presence of coral polyps, which are tiny, soft-bodied organisms. These polyps consist of photosynthesizing algae called zooxanthellae embedded within their tissues. Although corals do contribute to the oxygen production in the marine environment, their contribution is relatively small compared to that of phytoplankton. (ii) Rainforest plants: Rainforests are one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, supporting countless plant, animal, and fungal species. These dense forests house numerous trees and plants that produce oxygen through photosynthesis, contributing to approximately 28% of the world's oxygen turnover. However, even with their tremendous biodiversity and productivity, ocean phytoplankton still produce a larger share of Earth's oxygen. (iii) Ocean Phytoplankton: Phytoplankton are the primary producers in the marine environment and are responsible for generating about 50-80% of the oxygen produced on Earth. These tiny, single-celled photosynthetic organisms drift in the sunlit waters of the upper ocean and harness sunlight to produce oxygen and nutrients essential to marine food webs. The great abundance and wide distribution of phytoplankton render them the dominant contributor to Earth's oxygen supply. (iv) Continental Grasslands: Grasslands cover almost a quarter of Earth's land surface and are home to various grass species that carry out photosynthesis. Due to their extensive land coverage, grasslands contribute to the global oxygen production and carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, compared to ocean phytoplankton, grasslands' contribution to the Earth's oxygen supply is notably smaller. In conclusion, while all these ecosystems play an essential part in producing the oxygen we breathe, it is ocean phytoplankton that provides most of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, they serve as the foundation of marine food webs, sustaining both small and large marine organisms, making them a critical component of the global ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Klopp had watched powerless as Liverpool collapsed like a house of cards from a lead and a position of superiority to lose 3-1 to Sevilla, squandering the chance of Champions League football next season in the process. \\"This team will be a bit different next season, it is clear,\\" said Klopp. \\"We will do something with transfers.\\" Klopp's personality, allied to Liverpool's history and ambition, will always attract players - but life will be infinitely more difficult in a fiercely competitive summer market without the magnet that the Champions League, or indeed European football of any sort, provides. So what will Klopp need to change - and maintain - after Liverpool lost their second final of the season following the Capital One Cup defeat by Manchester City? The manner in which Liverpool's performance fell off a cliff once Kevin Gameiro equalised for Sevilla 17 seconds after the break, cancelling out Daniel Sturridge's brilliant opener, was alarming and Klopp was clearly taken aback. \\"We lost faith in our style of play,\\" said the German. \\"We changed from passing simple and quick to slow and complicated and lost our formation.\\" This was a damning indictment but a painful truth. Yes, Gameiro's equaliser was a psychological blow but Liverpool still had virtually the entire second half to put matters right. Instead, they visibly wilted and fell apart in key areas of the field. They were overrun in midfield and exposed in defence. Their body language sagged. It was a desperate sight as Sevilla tore them to shreds. The Spaniards are a very fine side who have now won the Europa League three seasons in succession but they are not Barcelona. Manchester City beat them 3-1 in their own stadium in this season's Champions League. Klopp has managed his resources with this final in mind and Liverpool have shown incredible reserves of mental strength in this competition - notably when scoring three goals in the last 20 minutes to beat Borussia Dortmund at Anfield - but here they were weak and shrunk ominously at the first sign of adversity. The difference was that they were inspired by a fervent Anfield atmosphere against Dortmund. In Basel, Liverpool's performance, and simply the way they looked mentally shot from the moment Sevilla equalised, gave their supporters no hope. There were no Liverpool leaders on the night and certainly no sense they were about to mount a comeback of Dortmund proportions. This time the final whistle was a mercy. Even Klopp's old tricks carried an air of desperation. He exhorted Liverpool's fans to inspire their team as they sank but it looked the act of a manager who knew the game was up. What were Liverpool's players doing to inspire their fans? He might have been better exhorting them. When Klopp goes shopping this summer he must prioritise strong characters and find a leader who will stop what happened in Basel happening again on the big occasion. Liverpool have conceded 19 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season. They are third in this list behind Chelsea (21) and Tottenham (20) - a statistic that adds weight to the argument that Klopp's team is a fragile one. Klopp will search for better players this summer. He must also find mentally tougher ones. When it comes to the case for changes, exhibit A in Basel was left-back Alberto Moreno. It was the second time the Spaniard has played a significant part in a Sevilla Europa League win, having been part of the side who lifted the trophy against Benfica in 2014. Moreno's hopeless performance brought criticism raining down on him, with BBC Sport analyst Mark Lawrenson in Basel saying simply: \\"He cannot defend.\\" He will surely be replaced and there needs to be much greater pressure placed on goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, who was hardly culpable here but has had another unconvincing season. Klopp is being heavily linked with 22-year-old Mainz keeper Loris Karius in a £5m deal but a more experienced candidate may be preferable. Klopp has tried to address one issue in central defence with the signing of Joel Matip from Schalke but there are other holes he needs to plug. Dejan Lovren has had a good season despite being disappointing in Basel - while 35-year-old Kolo Toure was Liverpool's best player against Sevilla but will it be enough to earn the Ivorian a new contract? Martin Skrtel is another who is surplus to requirements and past his best at 31, while Mamadou Sakho faces an uncertain future following a failed drugs test. So this area is a matter of urgency for Klopp, while in midfield Joe Allen and Lucas Leiva may yet find themselves surplus to requirements. Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze has been touted as a possible marquee signing but would the man who scored Germany's World Cup final winner against Argentina in Rio in 2014 be prepared to forgo Champions League football, no matter how close his relationship with Klopp after their time at Borussia Dortmund? Udinese's young Poland midfield Piotr Zielinski is widely expected to join Liverpool in a £10m deal, but where is the strong leader Liverpool need? Jordan Henderson is captain and was only substitute in Basel after injury, but it is clear this Liverpool team lacks mental steel and needs a figure of authority they can rally around on the field. And what of Christian Benteke? There is undoubtedly a fine striker inside Benteke waiting to get out but his £32.5m move to Liverpool from Aston Villa last summer looks increasingly like the wrong man to the wrong club at the wrong time. He was Klopp's last resort in Basel, thrown on with seven minutes left and the game effectively gone having seen fellow Belgian Divock Origi turned to first despite not having played since sustaining an ankle injury against Everton at Anfield on 17 April. Benteke did not suit the passing style of the man who bought him, Brendan Rodgers, and he does not suit Klopp's intense and energetic pressing style either. If Liverpool can recoup £20m-plus, perhaps from West Ham, then Benteke's stay at Liverpool will surely end. Even the effervescent Klopp looked desperately low in Switzerland and Liverpool were a badly beaten and bedraggled side when the final whistle put them out of their misery. This is hardly a club in crisis, however, and Liverpool can look to the future with a hefty measure of optimism. The chief reason to be cheerful is Klopp himself. He has taken Liverpool to two cup finals this season, without any real adjustments to his squad, and galvanised the club. He wanted to turn \\"doubters into believers\\" and even this disappointment will not dent faith in the German, who was one of Europe's most sought-after coaches when Liverpool appointed him in September. The 48-year-old has the passion and charisma, plus the coaching ability, that Liverpool's fans and players can thrive on. His big game players were totally marginalised in Basel. Philippe Coutinho barely touched the ball while the disappointing Roberto Firmino was substituted. The Brazilian duo, though, have shown enough this season to offer excitement for next term. And in attack Daniel Sturridge, the great enigma, scored a goal of rare brilliance, curving an effort with the outside of his left foot into the far corner of Sevilla's net to give Liverpool the lead and what turned out to be false hope. If Klopp can keep Sturridge fit and in the right frame of mind, Liverpool will have arguably England's most naturally talented striker. Roy Hodgson may yet be the beneficiary of Klopp's work with Sturridge at Euro 2016 in France. Klopp will also see his options increased next season by the return fitness of striker Danny Ings and young defender Joe Gomez, who both created such an excellent impression before both succumbing to serious knee injuries. So, as Klopp will have been stressing to Liverpool's players, this is not all doom and gloom. What does cast a cloud is that Liverpool need serious reinforcements and a disappointing defeat here that leaves them without Champions League and Europa League football next season will make it more difficult to secure the right men.

The 3-1 collapse exposed key areas that needed urgent improvement, such as bolstering the defense and midfield departments. Left-back Alberto Moreno was heavily criticized for his poor performance, and goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's unconvincing season also signaled a need for change. Klopp's pursuit of better and mentally-tougher players led to the signing of Joel Matip from Schalke, though further changes were necessary. Bayern Munich's Mario Götze was mentioned as a potential marquee signing, but his willingness to forgo Champions League football was questioned. Liverpool's squad was also lacking a strong leader to provide mental steel and authority. Meanwhile, Christian Benteke's future at the club seemed uncertain, with a £20m-plus recoup potentially coming from West Ham. Despite the disappointing defeat in the final, Liverpool could maintain some optimism with Klopp at the helm. His charisma and coaching abilities helped the team reach two cup finals in the 2015-2016 season without significant squad adjustments. Key players like Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, and Daniel Sturridge offered excitement for the next term. Additionally, the return of injured striker Danny Ings and young defender Joe Gomez could strengthen Liverpool's options. However, securing the right reinforcements without Champions League and Europa League football would pose a major challenge for the club."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, raspberries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Answer the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation, the candied fruits are those that have been placed in heated sugar syrup, allowing them to be saturated with sugar and preserved. In this scenario, Mary decided to candy raspberries, apricots, and apples. She did not candy plums, raspberries, and pears. Since the question asks which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apples or plums, the answer is apples. This is because Mary candied apples, while she did not candy plums."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount, legal name Le Sony'r Ra; May 22, 1914 - May 30, 1993) was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, \\"cosmic\\" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led \\"The Arkestra\\", an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up. Born and raised in Alabama, Blount eventually became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology that would make him a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. Sun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said: My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That's what they told me. Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician's closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15 years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20 years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \\"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\\" What happened at the stage?","completion":"At the stage, Sun Ra was with the beings from Saturn who had little antennas on their ears and eyes. They talked to him and told him to stop going to college because there would be big problems in schools and the world would be very messy. They said that he would speak through his music, and the whole world would listen.

Write an article with the title: \\"Walmart's Doug McMillon to replace Mike Duke as chief executive\\"","completion":"Title: Walmart's Doug McMillon to replace Mike Duke as chief executive Introduction Step 1: Introduce the topic by mentioning the key news - Doug McMillon replacing Mike Duke. Reasoning: Readers need to know the main subject of the article in the first few sentences, allowing them to decide whether to continue reading or not. In a major announcement, retail giant Walmart has confirmed that Doug McMillon will be taking the reins from the outgoing Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mike Duke. This significant change in leadership is expected to herald a new era for the company, with McMillon bringing his own distinct vision to the role. Background on Doug McMillon Step 2: Provide relevant background information on Doug McMillon. Reasoning: Readers need context on who McMillon is and why his appointment is noteworthy. Fifty-three-year-old McMillon is no stranger to Walmart, having started his career with the company more than three decades ago as an hourly summer associate. Climbing the corporate ladder through various management positions and international assignments, McMillon was eventually appointed as the head of Walmart's international division in 2009. This gave him oversight of the retailer's operations in 26 countries, hugely influencing his preparations for the top job. Mike Duke's Tenure Step 3: Briefly discuss Mike Duke's tenure as the CEO. Reasoning: A reference to the outgoing CEO provides a clear contrast and highlights the changes that might be expected under the new leadership. Mike Duke's time as Walmart's CEO was marked by global expansion and growth in e-commerce, though the company also faced several challenges, including labor disputes and scrutiny over their business practices. Under Dukes leadership, Walmart expanded its operations further into Asia and Africa, which helped cement its position as a dominant player in the retail industry. The Transition Plan Step 4: Discuss the transition plan and timeline for the change in leadership. Reasoning: To give readers an idea of how and when the change will be implemented. Walmart has announced that the transition in leadership will be effective from February 1, 2023, allowing for a smooth handover process between Duke and McMillon. During this period, McMillon will work closely with the board of directors and the leadership team to ensure a seamless transfer of responsibilities. McMillon's Challenges and Vision Step 5: Enumerate the challenges and vision that McMillon will face as the new CEO. Reasoning: This provides insight into the company's future direction and explores how McMillon's appointment may impact the organization. As the new CEO, McMillon will be tasked with navigating various challenges, including increased competition from e-commerce companies like Amazon, addressing environmental concerns and supply chain management, and maintaining good labor relations amidst a changing workforce landscape. McMillon's success will largely depend on his ability to bring a fresh perspective to Walmart's operations and continue to innovate in a rapidly evolving retail space. Conclusion Step 6: Wrap up the article by summarizing the key points and analyzing the potential impact of the leadership change. Reasoning: A strong conclusion reinforces the information presented and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the significance of the news. In conclusion, Doug McMillon's appointment as the new CEO of Walmart heralds a pivotal moment for the retail behemoth. With his wealth of experience and unique understanding of Walmart's global operations, McMillon has the potential to steer the company towards a new phase of growth and innovation. As the world awaits to see the impact of his leadership, one thing is certain: under McMillon's guidance, Walmart is poised to undergo significant transformation in the coming years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Josip Broz Tito: On 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by Milovan Đilas and Tito about \\"self-management\\" (samoupravljanje): a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced profit sharing and workplace democracy in previously state-run enterprises which then became the direct social ownership of the employees.

Tito also succeeded Ivan Ribar as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalization of relations between two nations. Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologized for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration.

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Answer the following question: What would happen if the cake was put in the oven for 50 minutes ?","completion":"If the cake was put in the oven for 50 minutes instead of the recommended 30 to 35 minutes, the following would likely happen: 1. Overbaking: The extended baking time would result in an overbaked cake, which could lead to a dry and crumbly texture. This is because the excess heat would evaporate more moisture from the cake than intended. 2. Browning or burning: The cake might also brown or burn on the outside, making it unappealing to eat. The high temperatures could cause the sugars and proteins in the cake to overreact and produce unpleasant flavors. 3. Possibly uneven baking: Because the cake is expected to be done within 30 to 35 minutes, the additional time in the oven might cause the cake to be overbaked on the edges and possibly still slightly underbaked in the center, leading to an uneven outcome. 4. Risk of the cake sinking: As the cake bakes longer than intended, the structure of the cake may weaken, causing it to possibly sink in the center once it's removed from the oven. To avoid these problems, it's essential to follow the recommended baking time and check for doneness using a cake tester or toothpick during the suggested time window."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact , such is the fear associated with this date that people just can't seem to stick to their daily routine on this day . The data from Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute suggests that somewhere around 17 to 21 million Americans are affected by the fear associated with this day , i.e. the combination of Friday and 13 . Even worse , the financial losses caused on this day amounts to as much as US800 million every year . As we flipped through the pages of history , we realized that Friday the 13th bears the brunt of bad luck associated with number 13 , the unluckiest number , and Friday , the unluckiest day of the week . Number 13 has always been considered unlucky , mainly as a result of it being associated with various occurrences in mythology . While some associate it with the instance of Norse mythology , in which the god of joy and gladness - Balter , was killed in a dishonest manner by Loki - the god of discord and mischief , who was the 13th guest , others associate it with the Last Supper , in which the 13th guest was Judas , who betrayed Jesus to his enemies for 30 pieces of silver . Similarly , Friday has also been a sign of bad luck to many people , with incidents like Jesus being crucified on this unfaithful day , contributing to this belief . It is also widely believed that Cain killed Able on this very day of the week . The fear of Friday the 13th is known as friggatriskaidekaphobia and paraskevidekatriaphobia , the former combining the words frigga , meaning Friday , and triskaidekaphobia , meaning the phobia of number 13 . Over the period , the belief that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has just become one of the most widely accepted superstitions , which consequently causes much blind panic and unreasonable fear in the world .

Is it right that males are more sexual than females? Do men want sex more than women? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"These two questions, while addressing similar aspects of gender and sexual desire or behavior, are not quite the same and each requires a nuanced examination. The subject is complex and involves biological, psychological, and societal factors. 1. \\"Is it right that males are more sexual than females?\\" This question seems to be asking about the inherent nature of male and female sexuality. Often, the question hinges on societal ideas of men being more 'sexual' beings than women. That said, sexual desire and behavior vary from person to person, regardless of sex and gender, and it's not accurate to say that one gender is \\"more sexual” than the other. Biologically, it's argued that men might possess a higher sex drive due to factors such as testosterone levels; however, this doesn't necessarily mean that men are more \\"sexual.” Women, too, have libido-determining hormones, and recent studies have suggested that women's sexual desires might be more complex than previously thought. From a societal standpoint, there are cultural norms and taboos that tend to suppress women's sexuality more than men's. Men may feel more social pressure to brag about or exaggerate their sexual desires and history, while women might feel more pressure to downplay theirs. There are exceptions and outliers in both genders, however. It's essential to note that many factors can affect an individual's sexuality, including age, stress levels, religion, personal beliefs, mental health, relationships, and life circumstances. 2. \\"Do men want sex more than women?\\" This question is a little more specific, but still broad, as it asks directly about the desire for sex. Various research over time shows that men, on average, report thinking about sex more frequently than women and may express a desire for a higher number of sexual partners and more frequent sexual encounters. However, this doesn't mean that every man wants sex more than every woman - one must always consider individual differences. Moreover, it also could be influenced by social expectations, as discussed earlier. Women may under-report their sexual desires due to societal expectations or perceptions. An important point to bring in here is that women's desire is often responsive rather than spontaneous, as per some research. This means women may not initiate or actively seek out sex as often as men do but might be just as into the act once it starts. Overall, these studies merely indicate trends and averages; they don't uniformly apply to all men or women. In conclusion, while there can be typical patterns in the sexual behaviors or desires of males and females due to both biological and societal factors, these don't define or limit the range of individual's sexual behavior or interest. Therefore, each question is approaching the topic from a slightly different angle - one is more focused on sexual nature in general, and the other is more directed towards the desire for sex. They are connected but not exactly the same. Remember, sexuality is deeply personal and varies significantly from person to person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Environmentalists split over green group's fracking industry ties In 2012, when Ohio’s Senate passed a controversial hydraulic fracturing bill that was supported by the oil and gas industry, environmental groups lined up against it, saying it would endanger public health. But during hearings on the bill, it gained one seemingly unlikely supporter: the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), one of the nation’s largest green groups. The bill supported renewable energy development but it also contained several items other environmental groups said were giveaways to the industry: It allowed fracking companies to keep private the chemicals they used in fracking, changed the required distance for contamination testing around a well from 300 feet to 1,500 feet, and prevented doctors from sharing information that might be considered trade secrets, even if it was in the interest of public health. Matt Watson, one of EDF’s policy analysts, said at the hearing, “We would like to commend the General Assembly and the governor for the thoughtful approach that has been put forward.” The group’s support for the bill highlighted a growing divide in the environmental movement, especially when it comes to natural gas. As fracking has expanded to dozens of states across the country, environmentalists have essentially been split into two camps: those who believe the process must be stopped at all costs, and those who believe drilling is inevitable, and so it’s better to work with industry on making it safer for the environment. But a new report critical of that latter group suggests that at least in some cases, environmental organizations’ work with the industry may cross ethical lines, and at worst become tacit support of industry-backed positions. The new report, released by Buffalo-based non-profit Public Accountability Initiative, focuses on one group called the Center for Sustainable Shale Development, which is a partnership between gas drilling companies, environmental groups and other nonprofits. CSSD’s mission is to promote safe drilling of shale — the kind of rock that fracking breaks up — in the Appalachian Basin. The group doesn’t try to hide its industry connections, and the names of the environmental groups that support it are clearly listed on the center’s website. But PAI’s report posits that the group is less a way for environmentalists to influence the oil and gas industry than it is a way for the industry to promote its agenda with the stamp of approval of green groups like EDF. Among the report’s findings: the group’s executive director, Susan Packard LeGros, is a former oil industry lawyer who worked with oil, gas and chemical companies. One of the group’s board members, Jared Cohon, also worked at a similar group called the Center for Indoor Air Research, which was found to have strong ties to tobacco companies. And one of the group’s new supporters, the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, was started by a titan of the oil and gas industry. “[Environmental groups] are pouring money into calming fears and calming objections,” said Vera Scroggins, a prominent anti-fracking activist in Pennsylvania. “They’re basically promoting something that’s been created by the industry.” The new report comes a year after PAI originally looked into CSSD. That report found similar evidence of other CSSD members and supporters being linked to the oil and gas industry in ways not disclosed by CSSD. Since that report, three non-profits dropped out of CSSD, including the Heinz Endowments, the William Penn Foundation, and the Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future. “We disagree with the position suggested by the organization’s name that fracking can be made environmentally ‘sustainable,’ and given the pace of shale development we do not believe that the goals of protecting environmental and public health are best served at this point by standards that are voluntary and unenforceable,” Heinz Endowments said in a statement. Several groups, including EDF, the Clean Air Task Force, the Group Against Smog and Pollution, and the Pennsylvania Environmental Council are still participating in CSSD. Supporters of the groups say it’s important to not let perfection become the enemy of progress. “If unconventional shale gas development is going to proceed, it needs to be done with strong and enforceable regulation and it needs to adapt so it can get better and better,” said Davitt Woodwell, the president of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council. “For us, the only way to do that is to understand what the industry is doing and how they operate so you can put forward strong proposals.” Woodwell says whether you support fracking or don’t, it’s important to face reality and work to make an already-existing process better. But PAI’s executive director Kevin Connor says the working-in-tandem approach does more harm for the environmental movement than good. “They put a friendly face on the dirty work that these industries do,” Connor said. Regardless of whether collaboration is beneficial or detrimental, some say it’s inevitable. Michael Yaziji, a professor at Switzerland-based business school IMD, and co-author of a book about the partnerships and conflicts between non-profits and corporations, says in a world where green groups are competing for resources and volunteers, it makes sense that they use different tactics to stand out: Some promise to make progress by working with an industry, while others build their credibility among donors and supporters by taking a strong stance against it. “The NGOs are almost like an industry,” Yaziji said. “They serve their stakeholders — their funders and their constituents. So they have to ask, ‘what differentiates us from the competition?’” Yaziji says the dynamic is nothing new: Cement giant LaFarge collaborated with the World Wildlife Fund on CO2 reduction initiatives for 13 years, until 2013. Oil and gas giant Shell has partnered with several organizations, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But with fracking so prominent in today’s news, and expanding so rapidly across the U.S., it seems the collaborations are being met with more anger and passion than ever before. “The whole premise of [this kind of collaboration] is that we can just nicely ask these companies to not pollute us, and that’s never going to work,” said Alison Auciello, an organizer for Food and Water Watch in Ohio. “They’re kind of standing directly in the way of what we’re doing.” Summary:","completion":"Camps within the environmentalist community are divided over the fracking industry, which many believe is inevitable and requires assistance to make it safer for the environment. In 2012, a hydraulic fracturing bill was passed in Ohio, which enabled renewable energy development but also allowed fracking companies to maintain privacy over the chemicals they used and prevented doctors from sharing trade secrets relating to public health. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), one of the largest green groups in the US, supported the bill. Critics argue that the fracking industry should be stopped altogether, however, some environmentalist groups work with the industry to ensure the best possible solution is found."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. This show was appreciated by critics and those who realized that any similarities between \\"Pushing Daisies\\" style and anyone else's was not a steal. (Yes, I've seen \\"Amelie.\\" \\"Pushing Daisies\\" is somewhat similar but still different enough to be original.) Rather, there are too few shows on TV that have this kind of quirky charm. The greatest similarity is to \\"Dead Like Me\\" but \\"P.D\\" comes by that similarity honestly: Bryan Fuller created both shows. (Both shows involve an \\"undead\\" young woman, For example.) This show never stopped being funny and charming, and it was always odd, yet was consistently humane.I must say a word about the conventions of on-going story lines. some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck's father without consequences of any kind. First of all, this must be a new definition of \\"without consequences of any kind\\" because, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of Chuck's father, he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done. Further, about a dozen episodes into the series, Ned finally did confess to Chuck that he had caused her father's death with his gift. Now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance. In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon.But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas. I remember when David Caruso's character on \\"NYPD Blue\\" did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it--for a whole year--then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show). The point is, viewers should learn by now and not assume that just because a regular character does something wrong in a single episode, and is not caught in that episode, that he has gotten away with it. There is always next week--and maybe even next year.","completion":"Based on the content of the review, it seems to have a positive tone. The reviewer appreciates the show's quirky charm, finds it funny and charming, and points out some similarities with other creations by the same creator. The reviewer also discusses an aspect of the story that some people have criticized, but offers a reasonable interpretation that suggests the show is dealing with it in a nuanced way. Therefore, I would classify this movie review as positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Read this article and answer this question Following their victory over the Patriots, the Steelers remained at home the next week for their second match-up of the season against division rivals the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens scored first with an 18-yard field goal by kicker Billy Cundiff, the only points scored in the first quarter by either team. Steelers kicker Shaun Suisham answered with a 36-yard field goal early in the second quarter, and a 30-yard field goal near the end, but both of these were quickly matched by Baltimore's Cundiff with a 43-yard and 51-yard field goal, respectively, giving Baltimore a 9-6 lead at halftime. The Ravens then increased their lead in the third quarter when Ray Rice scored the first touchdown of the game on a 4-yard run. The Steelers rallied hard in the fourth quarter, with running back Rashard Mendenhall making a 1-yard run to score a touchdown, and then taking the lead for the first time in the game when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger made a successful 25-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace in the endzone for a second touchdown. On their final drive of the game, the Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by Shaun Suisham, but a 5-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they were instead forced to punt the ball to the Ravens. The Ravens then began a 92-yard drive, culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Torrey Smith in the endzone with just 8 seconds remaining, giving them the game.

Let me tell you how we can create this amazing treat! First, let's talk about French fries. They are long, thin pieces of potatoes that are fried in oil. Usually, people eat French fries with a little bit of salt, and sometimes with ketchup. But, we are going to make them even better by adding some bacon and chilli. Have you ever tasted bacon? Bacon is a type of meat that comes from a pig. It's really tasty and a little bit salty. When you cook bacon, it becomes crispy and crunchy. To make our Bacon and Chilli Fries, we need to cook the bacon first. Ask an adult to help you with this step because cooking bacon needs some heat, and we don't want you to get hurt. Once the bacon is cooked, we need to break it into small pieces. Sprinkle these pieces of fried bacon over the top of your French fries. Now your fries are getting some of that delicious crunch! Next, we need to add some heat to our dish with chilli. Chilli is a spicy mixture made of beans, tomatoes, and some special spices. It's like a sauce that can make your food taste warm and exciting! To make our Bacon and Chilli Fries even more amazing, pour a can of chilli over the fries. Make sure you spread the chilli all over the fries, so every bite will be hot and tasty. There you have it, kids! Our fantastic and yummy Bacon and Chilli Fries are ready. You can eat this treat as it is or even dip the fries in some cool sour cream to balance the heat from the chilli.

Plot title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they discover a vent that allows them to navigate to different rooms that...

It's described that he examines their personalities and triggers their demeanors to understand their individual characters better, and he records each session. Psychological testing can include various tests that study the individual's behavior, intelligence, personality traits, certain skills, or specific clinical issues. The notion of 'triggering their demeanors' suggests that Dr. Day might be employing projective tests, situational tests, or other forms of behavioral observation to elicit reactions from the students that reveal more about their psychological states. However, the specific tests used by Dr. Day in the movie are not given in the plot description, and would likely be visible through the specific scenes in the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert in northern England late Monday, killing over a dozen people and injuring dozens in what police say they are treating as a terrorist attack. (AP... (Associated Press) MANCHESTER, England (AP) — An explosion struck an Ariana Grande concert attended by thousands of young music fans in northern England, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens in what police said Tuesday was being treated as a terrorist attack. Greater Manchester Police said 19 people were confirmed dead after the explosion at Manchester Arena. Northwest Ambulance Service said 59 injured people had been taken to hospitals, and a number of \\"walking wounded\\" were treated at the scene. Police cars, bomb-disposal units and 60 ambulances raced to the scene as the scale of the carnage became clear. \\"We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise,\\" said Ian Hopkins, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police. There was panic after the explosion, which struck around 10:30 p.m. (2130GMT) Monday night as Grande was ending the concert, part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. Grande, who was not injured, tweeted hours later: \\"Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don't have words.\\" Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended. One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said \\"Thank you, Manchester,\\" before leaving the stage. The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another. Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down. City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident. Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for. Jenny Brewster said she was leaving the concert with her 11-year-old daughter when the blast hit. \\"As I turned around, boom, one loud noise,\\" she told Sky News. \\"A gentleman said 'run!' so we ran.\\" Outside, she said, \\"you could smell the burning.\\" Britain's terrorist threat level stands at \\"severe,\\" the second-highest rung on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is highly likely. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Online, supporters of the extremist Islamic State group, which holds territory in Iraq's Mosul and around its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, celebrated the blast. One wrote: \\"May they taste what the weak people in Mosul and (Raqqa) experience from their being bombed and burned,\\" according to the U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group. If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005. \\"A huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena,\\" said concertgoer Majid Khan, 22. \\"It was one bang and essentially everyone from the other side of the arena where the bang was heard from suddenly came running towards us as they were trying to exit.\\" Added Oliver Jones, 17: \\"The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run.\\" Video from inside the arena showed concertgoers screaming as they made their way out amid a sea of pink balloons. British Prime Minister Theresa May said the government was working to establish \\"the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack.\\" May is due to chair a meeting of the government's COBRA emergency committee later Tuesday. She and other candidates suspended campaigning for Britain's June 8 election after the blast. Police advised the public to avoid the area around the Manchester Arena, and the train station near the arena, Victoria Station, was evacuated and all trains canceled. The Dangerous Woman tour is the third concert tour by 23-year-old Grande and supports her third studio album, \\"Dangerous Woman.\\" Grande's role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon's high school sitcom \\"Victorious\\" propelled her to teen idol status, starting in 2010. The tour began in Phoenix, Arizona, in February. After Manchester, Grande was to perform at venues in Europe, including Belgium, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and France, with concerts in Latin America and Asia to follow. Pop concerts and nightclubs have been a terrorism target before. Almost 90 people were killed by gunmen inspired by the extremist Islamic State group at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris during a performance by Eagles of Death Metal in November 2015. In Turkey, 39 people died when a gunman attacked New Year's revelers at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

News article: President Trump’s new attorney Rudy Giuliani said Thursday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should “close” Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe – a call that comes amid GOP pressure on Capitol Hill to find out whether the investigation has gone beyond its original mandate. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, criticized Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in several interviews this week. “The basis of the case is dead,” Giuliani said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday, claiming the push to uncover collusion with the Russians has turned up no evidence. “Sessions should step in and close it.” Such a move would seem unlikely. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation due to campaign involvement. Rosenstein stepped in, and appointed Mueller to lead his own probe. But Giuliani stressed, in a separate interview with Fox News' \\"Hannity\\" on Wednesday, that Sessions and Rosenstein should end Mueller’s investigation “in the interest of justice.” “There’s been too much government misconduct,” Giuliani said on “Hannity.” “The crimes now have all been committed by the government and their agents.” Giuliani’s comments come amid pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill urging the Justice Department to release the full “scope memo,” which outlines the original scope of the investigation when Mueller was named. The Justice Department made public through a court filing a redacted version of the memo, while explaining to Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., that the full, unredacted version could not be shared because it pertains to an ongoing criminal investigation. Still, members are pushing to find out whether his team is probing matters outside that original scope laid out by Rosenstein. “On May 17, 2017, I issued an order entitled ‘Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters,’ appointing you to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice,” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller in the scope memo. The order states that Mueller is authorized to conduct an investigation “confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony” before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20, 2017, including “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation.” Rosenstein then includes a more extensive list with a “more specific description” of Mueller’s “authority,” but that portion has been heavily redacted. The unredacted details only outline allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for allegedly committing “a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials” or “arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government.” The rest of the scope memo is blacked out. Rosenstein, meanwhile, warned earlier this week that the Justice Department is \\"not going to be extorted\\" after members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus drafted articles of impeachment against him. The articles apparently were drafted as a \\"last resort\\" in lawmakers' fight for documents. \\"I can tell you there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,\\" Rosenstein said. \\"We’re going to do what is required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job.\\" Giuliani made his latest comments as he discussed in depth the 130,000 payment Trump attorney Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016 to stay silent about accusations of an affair with Trump. Giuliani now says Trump reimbursed that money, but did not know at the time what it was for. Trump disputes the Daniels allegations. Last month, following the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s personal properties, and the revelation that it was referred by Mueller’s office, a spokesman for the special counsel referred Fox News to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 28, Section 600.4 regarding “additional jurisdiction.” That section indicates Mueller could expand the scope with DOJ consent. “If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specific in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the court of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction, or assign them elsewhere,” the code reads. Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report. ||||| CLOSE The former New York Mayor, who recently joined Trump's legal team, directly contradicted the president's claim that he had no knowledge of Michael Cohen's decision to pay Stormy Daniels 130,000. USA TODAY President Trump and Rudy Giuliani in 2016 (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) WASHINGTON — President Trump's new lawyer is casting renewed doubt on whether Trump will sit down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller about the Russia investigation. Attorney and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said in various interviews on Fox News that the president should not be under oath, in part because of concern that prosecutors may try to lay a perjury trap for the president. \\"What they’re really trying to do is trap him into perjury, and we’re not suckers,” Giuliani said Thursday on the Fox & Friends morning program. Giuliani also questioned the need for Trump's testimony, claiming a lack of evidence that Trump had anything to do with Russians who sought to influence the 2016 election with email hacks and fake news. “This silly deposition is about a case in which he supposedly colluded with the Russians but there’s no evidence,” Giuliani said. The Mueller investigation has yielded indictments of more than a dozen Russians as well as former Trump associates. Appearing on Wednesday night with Fox host Sean Hannity, Giuliani said that right now \\"the odds are he wouldn't be interviewed\\" by Mueller, but \\"I don't close my mind to it.\\" More: Trump could face more legal trouble after confirming he repaid Michael Cohen, watchdogs say More: Can Robert Mueller subpoena Donald Trump? Only the Supreme Court would know for sure More: Ty Cobb's departure means Donald Trump's legal team has almost completely turned over More: Donald Trump acknowledges Stormy Daniels payment, denies affair or use of campaign money The Mueller and Trump teams have been negotiating for more than four months on possible Trump testimony. Mueller has raised the prospect of a presidential subpoena if Trump refuses to testify, but Giuliani says the special counsel lacks the authority to enforce such a subpoena. While most of the coverage of Giuliani's recent television interviews concerned a 130,000 Trump payment to former adult actress Stormy Daniels, the president's attorney also had has new things to say about the Mueller investigation and fired FBI Director James Comey. When Trump fired Comey last year, he and aides said it was because of the way the former FBI director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the election. Trump later said it had something to do with the Russia investigation. On Fox, Giuliani said Trump also fired Comey because he refused to say publicly that Trump was not a target in the Russia investigation. The attorney also called for an interview to last only two to three hours, saying that was the limit President Bill Clinton had when he testified in the Ken Starr/Monica Lewinsky case. \\"I would like to get, one, not under oath,\\" Giuliani told Hannity. \\"I want a videotape, not videotaped, but audiotapes, I want to make sure they don't misrepresent his answers.\\" Giuliani's comments reflect a more aggressive attitude by Trump legal team in the wake of a personnel shakeups. Private attorney John Dowd left the team in March, and White House attorney Ty Cobb announced this week he will be retiring soon. Both had urged a more conciliatory approach to the special counsel. On Fox & Friends, Giuliani said the odds of an interview became longer after the FBI raided the home and office of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. He also blamed Mueller's office for the public revelation of a list of questions it wants to ask of Trump, though there is no evidence the Special Counsel's office leaked the document. \\"Now, we are going to have some convincing to do,\\" Giuliani said. \\"They’re going to have to convince us they’re going to be objective and they are not out to get us.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rkSzHl ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"President Trump’s new attorney Rudy Giuliani has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to close Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into potential Russian collusion in the 2016 US election.

A passenger jet was forced to make an emergency landing after a mysterious mid-air collision with a 'foreign object' at 26,000ft severely dented its nose cone. The front of the Air China Boeing 757 had been pushed in and scratches and scraped paintwork were clearly visible when it landed. The plane was climbing over China when a large bang was heard from the front of aircraft. Pictures of the Air China jet show the damage the mysterious mid-air collision caused to its nose cone after. The pilot said the aircraft was struggling to perform and he immediately called air traffic controllers, according to reports. He was then allowed him to return to the airport. Experts said investigations into the suspected crash have raised suspicions that the aircraft was hit by a 'foreign object'. However, they do not believe it was caused by a bird strike as no blood or feathers were visible on the dented nose cone. The damage was only spotted when the plane, which was travelling from Chengdu to Guangzhou, safely landed. The dented nose cone has caused speculation online that the aircraft hit a UFO as it flew over China. The pictures have prompted online speculation that it was caused by a UFO or a drone strike. Other theories posted on the Aviation Herald include pressure from rapidly heated and expanded air. Former government UFO investigator Nick Pope told The Sun that an examination of the nose cone should reveal what hit it. He said traces of whatever collided with the aircraft should be visible. However, he questioned whether the 'secretive' Chinese would reveal the cause. Mr Pope told The Sun: 'Cases like this show that whatever people believe about UFOs, there are serious air safety issues here. 'MoD and CAA files contain dozens of reports of near misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft. 'It's only a matter of time before there's a catastrophe.' The Air China Boeing 757 (similar to the one pictured) was forced to make an emergency landing. No one was hurt in the mysterious incident. Last week, it emerged that three passenger jet pilots saw UFOs. above Britain's Scientology headquarters on their approach to Gatwick. Airport. A report revealed that they each saw 'two flat, silver discs', with some flying within 100ft. Air traffic control then spotted six UFOs on their radars before they suddenly disappeared. The encounter, which was probed by the UK Airprox Board, happened on December 30 just before 9am over the Scientology headquarters in East Grinstead, Sussex. Highlights:","completion":"1. An Air China Boeing 757 made an emergency landing following a mid-air collision with an unidentifiable 'foreign object' at an altitude of 26,000 feet. The impact caused significant damage to its nose cone, leaving visible denting, scratches, and scraped paintwork. 2. The mysterious collision occurred while the plane was flying over China. The pilot reported a loud explosion from the front of the aircraft and noticed performance issues, which led to a call for air traffic controllers' assistance and subsequent approval to return to the airport. 3. Experts investigating the suspected collision suspect the aircraft collided with a 'foreign object'. However, they ruled out a bird strike as no blood or feathers were found on the damage site. 4. The damage was only detected upon the safe landing of the plane, which was journeying from Chengdu to Guangzhou.

Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face. A journalist, Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a photographer. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. Carmen asks Dale, her boss to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional Polish village of Alvania, the man killed at the beginning of the film. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central Europe. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time and does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura.

Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The Hoover Dam construction\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was the answer to the southwest's need for water?\\"?

News article: Mets media relations staffer Shannon Forde dead at 44 Shannon Forde was thin and tired, her fight against cancer raging. But this was the World Series and the Mets, the team she worked for and adored, had just lost. So she walked around a subdued clubhouse, patting disappointed players on the back, offering solace. For a while, she sat and talked with Matt Harvey, his arm around her. That was Shannon Dalton Forde. Forde, a beloved part of the Mets for more than two decades, died Friday night at 44 after a long battle with breast cancer, the team said. Her title with the Mets was senior director in the media relations department and the Mets called her a “pioneer for women in baseball public relations.” But she was so much more than that, too. WILLIE RANDOLPH 'HEARTBROKEN' BY DEATH OF SHANNON FORDE \\"Shannon was an absolute inspiration to everyone in this organization, including me, and I told her so,” GM Sandy Alderson, who is undergoing cancer treatment himself, said Friday night, via the Mets. “She was courageous in her fight and never let her illness claim her spirit. “That spirit will remain with the Mets, in our memories and in our hearts.\\" “She fought, fought and fought,” added manager Terry Collins. “She came to work as long as she could. She loved her job and loved the Mets. I have so much admiration for the way she conducted herself the last several years.” Forde was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer in August of 2012, but waged a dignified fight against the disease with the help of her husband, John, and two young children, Nicholas and Kendall. There were plenty of others who showed love for her, too — David Wright and Harvey stood up holding signs with her name on them during the Stand Up to Cancer ceremony at the 2013 All-Star Game. “Shannon was with me my whole career with the Mets,” Wright said. “She helped me so much when I was a rookie. She worked hard to assist my foundation and helped me get acclimated to New York.” Harvey’s never forgotten how, toward the end of his first season in the majors, Forde made him a memory book filled with newspaper stories chronicling all his starts, everything he’d gone through. Harvey knew Forde at that point, but not that well. She loved to laugh with a group of old school friends who dubbed themselves the “Dirty Dozen.” They’d sometimes call Shannon “Pam” — map spelled backward — because she possessed a remarkable sense of direction. WRIGHT ON SHANNON FORDE: 'SHE ALWAYS LEFT YOU WITH A SMILE' A fundraising dinner to help Shannon’s fight back in 2012 drew more than 1,100 people, including Alderson, Collins and stars such as David Cone, Harvey and Darryl Strawberry. Forde, a graduate of St. John’s University, started working for the Mets in 1994. It won’t ever be the same around the team again. “Shannon was a very unique person,” said Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. “I was fortunate to see her a few weeks ago at the rehab facility and had a great time laughing and visiting with her for over an hour. My condolences to her husband, John, two children, Nicholas and Kendall and the Dalton and Forde families. “Citi Field won’t be the same without her contagious smile and genuine personality.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article include: 1.

The Norman conquest of England was the 11th-century invasion and occupation of England by an army of Norman, Breton, and French soldiers led by Duke William II of Normandy, later styled as William the Conqueror. William's claim to the English throne derived from his familial relationship with the childless Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Confessor, who may have encouraged William's hopes for the throne. Edward died in January 1066 and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson. The Norwegian king Harald Hardrada invaded northern England in September 1066 and was victorious at the Battle of Fulford, but Harold defeated and killed him at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Within days, William landed in southern England. Harold marched south to confront him, leaving a significant portion of his army in the north. Harold's army confronted William's invaders on 14 October at the Battle of Hastings; William's force defeated Harold, who was killed in the engagement. Although William's main rivals were gone, he still faced rebellions over the following years and was not secure on his throne until after 1072. The lands of the resisting English elite were confiscated; some of the elite fled into exile. To control his new kingdom, William granted lands to his followers and built castles commanding military strongpoints throughout the land. Other effects of the conquest included the court and government, the introduction of the Norman language as the language of the elites, and changes in the composition of the upper classes, as William enfeoffed lands to be held directly from the king. More gradual changes affected the agricultural classes and village life: the main change appears to have been the formal elimination of slavery, which may or may not have been linked to the invasion. There was little alteration in the structure of government, as the new Norman administrators took over many of the forms of Anglo-Saxon government. Answer this series of questions: 1.

Over the years, the Buffalo Bills have had their share of trials and triumphs in their quest for victory. One of the franchise's most exciting moments on the field is a 20-yard touchdown pass. With misdirection, speed, excellent ball placement, and on-point quarterbacking, putting points on the board becomes a sight to savour for the fans. This article will explore the potential offensive playmakers who would complete a crucial 20-yard touchdown pass for the Buffalo Bills. Josh Allen – The Franchise Quarterback A centerpiece of the team's resurgence in recent years has been quarterback Josh Allen. Drafted seventh overall in the 2018 NFL Draft, Allen possesses a unique combination of athletic ability, precision, and arm strength. His 6-foot 5-inch frame and rocket arm have made him a fearsome opponent for defenses who struggle to contain his dual-threat ability. With Allen at the helm, a 20-yard touchdown pass is more than attainable, as he can employ his keen eye for spotting open receivers downfield and drive home the throw with velocity and touch. Allen's skill set makes him the most likely candidate to lead the charge in completing a 20-yard touchdown pass for Buffalo. Stefon Diggs – The Explosive, Elite Wide Receiver When it comes to the receiving end of that potential 20-yard touchdown pass, one name immediately jumps to the forefront: Stefon Diggs. Acquired from the Minnesota Vikings prior to the 2020 season, Diggs has made an instant impact on the Buffalo offense. In his first year with the team, he led the league in both receptions (127) and receiving yards (1,535), transforming the Bills' aerial attack into one of the most prolific in the NFL. Diggs' smooth route running, physicality against cornerbacks, and separation skills enable him to excel at pulling in long touchdown passes. With Diggs running a downfield route and Allen throwing the ball, a 20-yard touchdown pass becomes more than just a possibility—it becomes an expectation. Cole Beasley - The Reliable Slot Machine In addition to Diggs, another key player in the Buffalo receiving corps is the versatile Cole Beasley. Known for his quickness and route savvy, Beasley thrives on finding soft spots in the opponents' defensive coverage and providing Allen with a reliable check-down option. However, the 5-foot 8-inch receiver can also surprise defenses with his sneaky speed and ability to break long gains after the catch. With a creative play design, Beasley could shake off defenders and find himself in the end zone, completing the 20-yard touchdown pass from Allen. Gabriel Davis - The Up-and-Coming Speedster Despite being just a rookie, Gabriel Davis has shown flashes of greatness in his first season. The young receiver's physical size (6-foot 2-inch, 216 lbs.) and blazing top-end speed have positioned him as a deep threat and red zone target. Allen has already connected with Davis on several long touchdown passes, showcasing the promising chemistry between the quarterback and the emerging talent. Like Diggs, Davis specializes in breaking away from defenders and putting himself in prime position for scoring big plays. A 20-yard touchdown pass involving Gabriel Davis is not only achievable but likely as he continues to develop and build rapport with Allen. Conclusion The Buffalo Bills have seen their offensive prowess drastically improve in recent years, with a potent passing attack driven by a franchise quarterback and a slew of talented wide receivers. Four key players stand out in the Bills' equation for a successful 20-yard touchdown pass: quarterback Josh Allen, top wide receiver Stefon Diggs, dependable slot man Cole Beasley, and rising star Gabriel Davis. With these playmakers on the field, Buffalo continues to dazzle fans and provide moments of high-flying football excitement. No matter who ultimately catches the touchdown pass, the future looks bright for the Buffalo Bills and their electrifying offense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie plot title: Scream 2 Movie plot: While attending a preview of the film Stab, a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders depicted in the first film, two Ohio Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims. That afternoon, while Gale is talking to Dewey and Randy on the campus lawn, she receives a call from Ghostface hinting that he is watching them....

Q: On April 4, 2008, Beyoncé married Jay Z. She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \\"Crazy in Love\\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyoncé her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and the top-five songs \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Halo\\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \\"Halo\\"'s success in the US helped Beyoncé attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and singles \\"Diva\\", \\"Ego\\", \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Video Phone\\". The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \\"first major dance craze\\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \\"You Belong with Me\\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyoncé improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

Given the question: I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Now, I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Answer this question please: Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? The answer is:","completion":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm. There are several factors at play that contribute to this conclusion. First, let's consider the differences in their farming practices as they pertain to fertilizer use. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes and, as a result, has significantly increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. On the other hand, Kenny grows tomatoes, which are not currently in season, so his use of fertilizer is low. When there is heavy rainfall, as mentioned in the given situation, rain dissolves the fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away. This runoff eventually ends up in bodies of water, including the ponds located downstream from Bobby and Kenny's farms. Since Bobby is using a significantly higher amount of fertilizer compared to Kenny, it is expected that the runoff from Bobby's farm will contain a greater concentration of nitrogen (a key component of most fertilizers). The presence of nitrogen in the water acts as a fertilizer, promoting the growth of algae. When there is an overabundance of nitrogen, it can lead to uncontrollable algae growth, which consumes carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die off, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen during the decomposition process. This, in turn, depletes the oxygen in the water and creates dead zones where little to no aquatic life can survive due to the lack of oxygen. In this situation, the higher concentration of nitrogen-rich runoff from Bobby's farm will contribute to a larger algal bloom in the ponds downstream. This will ultimately lead to more oxygen being consumed by decomposers as they break down the dead algae, resulting in a greater depletion of oxygen levels in the ponds near Bobby's farm. Meanwhile, Kenny's low use of fertilizer, combined with the fact that his tomatoes are not in season, will result in less nitrogen runoff and, consequently, a smaller impact on the oxygen levels in the ponds near his farm. In conclusion, due to the difference in fertilizer usage and the impact of nitrogen runoff on algal growth and oxygen depletion, Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm compared to Bobby."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: A 20-year-old Missouri man has been arrested in last week's shooting of two St. Louis County police officers, county officials announced Sunday. Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and is charged with two counts of assault in the first degree, three counts of armed criminal action and firing a weapon from a vehicle, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch said during the afternoon press conference. McCulloch said Williams was “out there earlier that evening as part of the demonstration” and told police that he fired shots at someone he had a dispute with, and hit the officers, who he alleges were not his intended target. \\"We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,\\" McCulloch said, adding that there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of firing from. But several activists who've been involved in the protests since the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer told The Associated Press they were not familiar with Williams. Brittany Ferrell, 26, a protest leader with the group Millennial Activists United, had just left a meeting with other leaders Sunday when word of the arrest circulated. She said no one in the group knew Williams, and they checked with other frequent protesters — who also hadn't heard of him. Ferrell suspected McCulloch tried to cast him as a protester to reflect negatively on the movement. \\"This is a fear tactic,\\" she said. \\"We are very tight-knit. We know each other by face if not by name, and we've never seen this person before.\\" John Gaskin, a St. Louis NAACP leader, said of Williams, \\"I don't know him. I've never seen him.\\" McCulloch said Williams’ story of a dispute with another person -- including that he did not target the police -- is still part of the investigation, which is ongoing. McCulloch said the .40-caliber handgun that matches the shell casings recovered at the scene of the officers’ shootings was found in Williams’ residence, which police searched after obtaining a warrant based on information received from the public. Williams, who is being held on 300,000 cash bond, had a warrant out on him because he is on probation for receiving stolen property and has failed to appear to his parole officer for the past seven months, McCulloch said. Williams is scheduled to appear in county court in Clayton Monday morning. St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said he didn't know whether Williams had an attorney or when he'd appear in court. A message left at the St. Louis County Justice Center was not immediately returned. Tips from the public were key in leading police to Williams, and McCulloch urged anyone with information to contact local law enforcement with further information. The officers -- a 41-year-old St. Louis County officer and a 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves -- were shot Thursday as protests were winding down following the resignation of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. Jackson was the sixth city official to leave office following a Justice Department review of the city's law enforcement practices. Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday, and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed. The St. Louis County officer was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting through his back. The officer from Webster Groves was shot in the right cheek, just below the eye. The bullet became lodged behind his ear. The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department. The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away, a distance longer than a football field. But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building, the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them, Belmar said. Belmar said Friday detectives were working around the clock to crack that case. The department's top priority, he said, was to continue \\"a tempo of service and protection and relationships\\" that ensure Ferguson does not \\"have a regression from all that we've done since last fall.\\" The gunfire drew instant, broad condemnation from activists. Dozens of protesters gathered again Thursday night in Ferguson, expressing sympathy for the wounded officers and praying for peace during a candlelight vigil. \\"We cannot afford these kinds of incidents happening. That gets us absolutely nowhere,\\" said St. Louis activist John Gaskin III. He called the gunfire \\"disgraceful and cowardly\\" and said people \\"need to be working for reforms and justice, not revenge.\\" Robinson said the wounding of the officers \\"definitely set us back.\\" But he believes protesters can regain what they lost. \\"Even last night as we protested, police were very gracious to us,\\" he said Friday. \\"That shows a lot of trust to us.\\" Gaskin said protesters should take stock in the Ferguson house cleaning they helped achieve. \\"Although the work is not nearly done,\\" he said, \\"this is a time for practitioners of democracy to pat themselves on the back for significant change.\\" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement Sunday that the arrest \\"sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated\\" and praised \\"significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department.\\" President Obama condemned the shooting of the officers, saying that though the city's law enforcement practices were \\"oppressive and objectionable,\\" there was \\"no excuse\\" for violence. Obama made the remarks during a taped appearance on ABC's \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live\\" Thursday. Brown's family issued a statement Thursday condemning the shooting. \\"We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement,\\" the statement read. \\"It cannot and will not be tolerated.\\" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the City Council issued a joint statement saying they support \\"peaceful protesting\\" but \\"will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying actions.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Pansexual' rises on National Coming Out Day On National Coming Out Day 2015, it appeared that more people came out on Twitter and Instagram as pansexual or bisexual than as lesbian or transgender, a Vocativ analysis showed. Vocativ used our technology to analyze more than 329,597 Twitter and Instagram posts from October 11 about National Coming Out Day, revealing that more than 3,600 of them — including retweets — mentioned the word \\"pansexual.\\" The term was posted more than \\"lesbian\\" or \\"transgender\\" combined. Pansexual, which means someone who's experience of attraction is not limited by biological sex or gender identity, is one of the fastest growing queer identities used by youth online, especially among American teens and girls. On Sunday, many others identified themselves online as bisexual, with an estimated 1,431 Twitter and Instagram posts mentioning the term. Among 43,369 posts about National Coming Out Day that specifically included \\"I\\" and \\"I am,\\" \\"bisexual\\" was the second most-posted descriptor after the all encompassing \\"gay.\\" \\"Pansexual\\" followed. That doesn't necessarily mean that lesbian or transgender people are less prominent in queer networks. It does, however, indicate that a growing number of young people who could have previously been overlooked in queer representation because they also date members of the opposite sex are now using social media to broadcast their queerness and celebrate the diversity of queer sexuality. Several hundred posts from National Coming Out Day also used the hashtag #questioning, with young people sharing that they are exploring their own gender identity. Many others posted #transisbeautiful, which was among the post popular hashtags on Sunday. The post \\"Pansexual\\" Rises On National Coming Out Day appeared first on Vocativ.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Chinese people both in the country and abroad have contacted the BBC with their reactions to the latest developments. I am a senior high school student from China. I think it's a good news for most of us. At primary school most of my classmates - including me - were only children and many of us wanted to have a sibling. My cousin was a second child, and my aunt and uncle were heavily fined. But I think the one-child policy was quite effective and benefited China in the past few decades. In my grandparents' generation, they usually had big families with around five to 10 kids, some might be more than that. Nowadays most of the people in China would prefer to have between one and three kids - except for some rural areas. Because of the cost of living and raising a child is higher than before, people would not want to have too many kids. So I think it's the right time to change this policy. I'm a supporter of the one-child policy but now our country has an ageing population problem. At the same time, our population is still quite large. It's a really difficult decision. Great news! I am a Chinese national married to an English man. I am an only child myself. My parents loved kids but they could only have me because of the threat of losing their jobs if they had more. I felt lonely growing up by myself. My parents tried their best by having my cousins over and sending me to my cousins for a day but I always wished I had sisters and brothers. Now my parents are over 50 and my grandparents are living with them. I want to be able to help my parents too but it will be hard to make them move all the way to the UK and give up their life and friends in China. My husband is very understanding of the Chinese culture and we are working hard now to save money to begin our own family. If we are blessed, I will definitely have more than one child. This is a good news for us. My husband and I have not had a baby even though we are already over 30. We are considering having babies abroad rather than in China. Anyway, it is good news, especially for couples like us. It's good news to me - a middle school teacher - who has always dreamed of having a second child. I'm a college student from China. I'm an only child and my parents will not have another child. This is because they are in their fifties and the cost of raising a child is too high. This is a highly anticipated result. The one-child policy is unpopular in rural areas where preference to a male child is widespread. This should be abolished. I am glad to hear the news. This is good news for me and many city dwellers. I have been considering a second child for years but haven't been able to because of the policy restriction. Now the obstacle is removed, it's time to carry on. Both of my children were born in China to a Chinese mother. My son was given his citizenship documents - but it wasn't so straightforward for baby number two. According to the one-child policy, she could not get the same documents. This meant she would not be able to attend a state school or move easily from city to city. Luckily, as the child of a British expat she got British citizenship and so could attend an international school. I have seen how parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents all dote on a single child. Not only is there enormous pressure on these only children to do well in their school exams, but according to tradition they are also expected to look after their parents when they grow old. So a two-child policy seems to me a perfect compromise. It still aims to keep the population at a stable size, but now the next generation will grow up with a playmate to share with (and fight with!). \\"This policy can only satisfy the super rich and super poor,\\" because \\"the rich do not worry [financially] about raising more than one child\\" and \\"the poor have more children to carry out labour\\". \\"I am grateful to the party for liberalizing the two-child policy; I can finally have a little sister.\\" Produced by Dhruti Shah and BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen Summary:","completion":"The Chinese population reacts positively to the new two-child policy, with many expressing relief and excitement, while recognizing the one-child policy's effectiveness in the past."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: A parking lot with a bicyclist riding through it. Hypothesis: a human riding a bike in a parking lot .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, based on the information given. Let's analyze it in detail. The premise states: \\"A parking lot with a bicyclist riding through it.\\" Here, there are two main components; one is the 'parking lot', and the other is the 'bicyclist riding'. 1. Parking Lot: This refers to a dedicated area or building where people can leave their cars or other vehicles temporarily. In this given premise, it is the setting or location where some activity is taking place. 2. Bicyclist Riding: This part of the premise denotes an action happening at the specified location. A 'bicyclist riding' refers to a scene where an individual is cycling, which is the act of riding a bicycle. Now let's consider the hypothesis: \\"a human riding a bike in a parking lot.\\" Let's delve into its two main aspects. 1. Human Riding a Bike: This refers to an individual who is in the action of cycling. Generally, when we refer to a 'bike', it's a common short form for a bicycle, although it can also denote a motorbike depending on the context. Here, in the context of the premise and the lack of any additional information, it's safe to assume that 'bike' refers to a 'bicycle'. 2. In a Parking Lot: This describes the location of where this action is taking place. 'In a parking lot' aligns with the location given in the premise. Inferences: Both the premise and the hypothesis involve a parking lot as the scene of action. They also both include the activity of bike riding, which likely refers to cycling. Seeing as how both the premise and hypothesis align significantly, one can infer that the hypothesis \\"a human riding a bike in a parking lot\\" would be true if the premise \\"A parking lot with a bicyclist riding through it\\" is true. There's enough similarity and connection between the premise and the hypothesis to draw this conclusion. However, it must be noted that conclusions are largely based on the given information and are subject to change if additional context, that might impact the interpretation, is provided. Hence, with the current information, we can assertively conclude that the hypothesis is valid if the premise holds true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me explain it to you like you're five. Imagine you want to know how many candies are in a big jar, but counting them one by one is too hard. The Monte Carlo method is like asking a lot of friends to guess how many candies are there. Then, you take all your friends' guesses and find an average. That average is a good guess for the number of candies in the jar. So, the Monte Carlo method uses random guesses to find answers to difficult problems, just like how you and your friends guessed the number of candies. This method is helpful for solving complex problems in math, science, and other areas where finding the exact answer is too tricky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this. He set a half dollar on the bar and started for the door. \\"Don't get in a huff,\\" the bartender said. Marlin looked back. \\"Kraamer lives about a mile west of town. Follow the railroad and take the first trail south.\\" Marlin felt like: - The farmers were intelligent - not enough information - He is too old to look for Kraamer - The whiskey was bad A:","completion":"Based on the narrative given: - There is not enough information to infer whether the farmers were intelligent or not. - Marlin does indeed feel he is too old to be on the lookout for Kraamer, as indicated by his thought \\"He was too old for this.\\" - Nothing in the text gives an indication of the quality of the whiskey, so we can't determine if it was bad or not.

Please answer the following question: Title: Not a good fit Product review: Used the first week then stopped. Not a good fit and not impressed by the sound quality. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, I would say that this review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer has expressed their dissatisfaction with the product by stating that it was \\"not a good fit\\" and they were \\"not impressed by the sound quality.\\" These negative remarks highlight the reviewer's unfavorable experience with the product. To provide a detailed analysis of the reviewer's unflattering depiction, let's break down the two main points mentioned in the review: the fit and the sound quality. 1.Regarding the fit, the reviewer states that the product was \\"not a good fit.\\" This suggests that the product did not meet their expectations in terms of comfort or usability. A good fit typically refers to a product that suits the user's needs or preferences, making it comfortable and easy to use. When a product is described as not having a good fit, it often means the user encountered problems or discomfort while using it, leading to a lower level of satisfaction. In this case, the reviewer's experience with the fit is presented in a negative light, which casts an unflattering view of the product. 2. When it comes to sound quality, the reviewer again expresses dissatisfaction by stating that they were \\"not impressed.\\" Sound quality is a crucial aspect of many products, especially when it comes to audio equipment or devices. High-quality sound is a major selling point for such products, and customers usually have high expectations. By mentioning their disappointment with the sound quality, the reviewer is conveying their negative experience, which could potentially deter other consumers from purchasing the product. This aspect of the review is, again, unflattering and reflects poorly on the product. In summary, the product review demonstrates the reviewer's disappointment and dissatisfaction with both major aspects of the product—the fit and the sound quality. As a result, the review can be characterized as unflattering and potentially discouraging for potential buyers. This negative depiction of the product serves as a warning for future consumers to look for alternative options that may better suit their needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: You are given a new situation: Belgium and France are two countries participating at a human health meeting. Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher. and a hint : Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market... Please answer this question : Which country had more species of animals disappear? The answer is:","completion":"It is not explicitly stated in the provided information which country, Belgium or France, had more species of animals disappear. However, considering that France has a higher biodiversity compared to Belgium, it is possible that France might have experienced a larger number of species disappearances, as there are more species present in the first place. It is important to note, though, that the exact number of species disappearing would require further research and data to provide a definitive answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Gain more practice with joking around and laughing by forcing yourself to tell jokes to others. This can help you to take yourself less seriously and show you are willing to be funny. You may want to look up some good jokes online and perform them in a mirror before you try them on others. You may also try out jokes on sympathetic friends before you tell them to a larger audience. It may also be fun to try an amateur comedy night at a local bar or pub and showcase your sense of humor to a room of sympathetic strangers. A good joke consists of a setup and punchline. The setup is the first half of the joke and usually contains the location and the key individuals. The punchline is usually one line and produces the laugh. For example, you may have the following set up: “A priest, a minister, and a rabbi walk into a bar.” You may then have this punchline: “The bartender says: ‘What is this, some kind of joke?’” . A funny story or anecdote can also help to lighten the mood and show you are willing to laugh with others. Telling a funny story is similar to telling a joke. You should combine timing and physical gestures and create a setup and a punchline for the story. You should also maintain eye contact with your audience as you tell the story and try to end the story on the line that will get the biggest laugh. When you are telling a joke or a story, you should try to be brief and to the point. Your audience has a limited attention span and you do not want them to lose interest in the story before you get to the punchline. Get a better sense of what is considered funny by watching television shows and films that are considered comedic. Professional comedy actors are often very good at using timing and physical gestures, as well as well placed jokes, to get the viewer to laugh. Note if you prefer certain styles of comedy over others, such as dark humor, dry humor, or slapstick humor. You may then be able to determine which jokes you may find funny in real life around your coworkers, friends, or family. If you respond to slapstick humor in film or television, you may respond well to it in your own life.","completion":"The article encourages practicing joke-telling and observing various comedy styles to improve one's sense of humor, while emphasizing the importance of timing, physical gestures, and retaining audience's attention through concise and well-constructed setups and punchlines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can grow just about any low-maintenance plant in a terrarium, but you’ll need to choose plants that will grow well together. Get a selection of plants that grow in similar conditions in the wild, such as woodland, desert, or tropical plants. For instance, if you choose a woodland theme, you might grow moss, foam flowers, and hepatica. Many of these plants do best in cool, shady conditions. Desert plants, such as cacti and other succulents, do best with brighter light and low humidity levels. Tropical plants, like Tahitian bridal veil and Venus fly traps, like warm and humid conditions. Plants that grow really wide or tall aren’t the best options for terrarium gardens. Instead, stick to small, low-growing plants, or those that can be easily pruned down to a manageable size. For example, starfish plants are ideal for terrariums since they only grow to be about 6 inches (15 cm) tall when they’re fully mature. Some terrarium plants, like club moss, like to spread horizontally. You may need to trim them back to keep them from taking over the entire terrarium. Others, like the false aralia, need to be pruned to prevent them from getting too tall. You can use just about any kind of glass container for a terrarium, from a fish tank to an old-fashioned glass bottle. However, if you’re growing plants that like dry conditions, such as succulents, you’ll need a container that doesn’t retain too much moisture. Choose an open container with relatively low sides for these kinds of plants. For example, a fish tank or an old punch bowl could make a great terrarium for some haworthia, hens and chicks, and mini-cacti. Avoid growing succulents or cacti in containers with tall or curved walls, since these retain more humidity and don’t promote good air flow. Tropical and woodland plants typically enjoy plenty of moisture, so they do best in more closed-off environments. If you have plants that need humidity, try using a container such as a jar, a vase with a broad bottom, or a Wardian case (which looks like a tiny greenhouse). Some plants that do well in more enclosed containers include ferns, begonias, mosses, and ivies. You can even create a fully closed-off environment by growing your plants under a glass cloche or inside a bottle.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime.

Question: Which causes a smaller loss, Stoke shift loss or internal optical losses? Context: Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.

It is characterized by high blood sugar levels that start or are first diagnosed during pregnancy. There's still a lot that researchers don't know about the condition, but it's clear that early detection and proper management are crucial for the health of both the mother and her baby. The following procedures are recommended for expectant mothers to screen, test, and identify gestational diabetes: fetal ultrasound during the second trimester, blood testing, and amniocentesis. This article discusses each of these steps in detail and explores their significance for pregnant women and their newborns. 1. Fetal Ultrasound during the Second Trimester Screening Fetal ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging procedure used to examine the development and overall health of the unborn baby. During the second trimester, typically between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, most healthcare providers recommend a comprehensive ultrasound to check for any anomalies or potential complications. One of the reasons for performing a fetal ultrasound is screening for signs of gestational diabetes. A baby's size can be an early indicator of the condition; if the baby is measuring larger than expected, it can suggest uncontrolled blood sugar levels in the mother. Subsequently, a diagnosis of gestational diabetes can be made, and a treatment plan can be put in place to manage the condition. 2. Blood Testing Blood testing is an essential part of prenatal care, and it plays a pivotal role in identifying gestational diabetes. A glucose screening test is typically conducted between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. This test involves drinking a sugary liquid, followed by a blood test one hour later to measure the blood sugar levels. If the test results indicate high blood sugar levels, the mother will need to undergo a more extensive glucose tolerance test to confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Blood testing can help ensure that high blood sugar levels are detected early in the pregnancy, allowing the healthcare provider to recommend necessary treatments or lifestyle changes. Properly managing blood sugar levels can prevent complications for both the mother and her unborn child, such as giving birth to a baby with macrosomia (an excessively large size) or developing type 2 diabetes in the future. 3. Amniocentesis An amniocentesis is a more invasive diagnostic procedure in which a small sample of amniotic fluid is extracted from the uterus of the pregnant woman, typically between 15 and 20 weeks. The cells in the fluid can be analyzed to identify chromosomal abnormalities, neural tube defects, and infectious diseases. In select cases, an amniocentesis can be performed to detect metabolic disorders, including gestational diabetes. If blood tests and ultrasounds show a high risk for the condition, the healthcare provider may recommend amniocentesis to gather additional information. Although invasive and associated with a risk of complications, the information from an amniocentesis can be vital in managing high-risk pregnancies effectively. Conclusion: Screening for gestational diabetes is essential during pregnancy to ensure the health of both the mother and her baby. Through fetal ultrasound, blood testing, and, in some cases, amniocentesis, healthcare providers are able to diagnose, monitor, and manage gestational diabetes. Early detection and proper management of the condition can decrease the risk of complications, leading to a healthy pregnancy and a bright future for both mother and child."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The game marked the third consecutive season game between the two teams and 36th all-time, with the Dolphins winning the last two games with an average margin of victory of 18 points. Miami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback Carson Palmer threw a 64-yard touchdown to Mike Goodson tying the game. Through a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter Brandon Fields and Oakland punter Shane Lechler. By the end of the game Field punted the ball six times for 319 yards with an average yard per punt of 53.2 and Lechler punted the ball nine times for 422 yards with an average yard per punt of 46.9. However, Oakland managed to get the ball back with (3:33) left in the quarter and orchestrated a drive that ended with a Sebastian Janikowski 25-yard field goal. Both teams entered halftime evenly matched. It didn't take long following halftime for the Dolphins rushing attack to shine. On the second possession of the half the Dolphins drove the ball down field and allowed Reggie Bush to rush for a 25-yard touchdown. On the next Miami possession, after a quick pass from Tannehill to receiver Brian Hartline, Reggie Bush rushed 65 yards for another Miami touchdown. A few possessions later Oakland answered with a Janikowski 27-yard field goal. With little opposition from the Oakland defense Miami's offense kept the ball moving and managed to score on their next two possessions. Once with an Anthony Fasano 14-yard reception touchdown from Tannehill, the first of his career, and again with a Lamar Miller 15-yard rushing touchdown, the first of his career. Oakland tried to stop the bleeding on their next drive, but quarterback Palmer was intercepted by safety Reshad Jones. The impressive game of 172 rushing yards on 26 attempts by running back Reggie Bush earned him the week 2 AFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Air and Ground rusher of the week honors.

His mother Mary nee Nagle (c. 1702-1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a declasse County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the chief \\"Gall\\" families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\". Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic. The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power in March 1782. Burke was appointed Paymaster of the Forces and a Privy Counsellor, but without a seat in Cabinet. Rockingham's unexpected death in July 1782 and replacement with Shelburne as Prime Minister, put an end to his administration after only a few months, however, Burke did manage to introduce two Acts. The Paymaster General Act 1782 ended the post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were required to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act. The Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782 was a watered down version of Burke's original intentions as outlined in his famous Speech on Economical Reform of 11 February 1780. He managed, however, to abolish 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration. The third Secretary of State and the Board of Trade were abolished and pensions were limited and regulated. The Act was anticipated to save PS72,368 a year. In February 1783, Burke resumed the post of Paymaster of the Forces when Shelburne's government fell and was replaced by a coalition headed by North that included Charles James Fox. That coalition fell in 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of William Pitt the Younger, which lasted until 1801. Accordingly, having supported Fox and North, Burke was in opposition for the remainder of his political life. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did the Paymaster General Act 1782 do?","completion":"The Paymaster General Act 1782 brought significant reforms to the position of Paymaster. Previously, Paymasters had been able to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. The Act changed this by requiring Paymasters to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury into the Bank of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would then receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank.

He categorized the certain sections of his county's population. First he categorized boys and girls between nine and thirteen years as cat A. Then he put girls between fourteen and eighteen years in cat B, and boys of the same age in cat C. Lastly, he categorized pregnant women as cat D. He needs to recommend healthy diet, especially iron intake, for each group. and a hint : Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Please answer this question : Which group would need less iron, cat B or cat C?","completion":"Based on the information provided, cat B consists of girls between the ages of 14 and 18, and cat C consists of boys between the ages of 14 and 18. The recommended daily iron intake for girls in cat B is 15 mg, while for boys in cat C, it is 11 mg. Comparing the two categories, cat B (girls aged 14-18) requires a higher iron intake than cat C (boys aged 14-18). Therefore, cat C would need less iron compared to cat B. To ensure these groups receive the appropriate amount of iron, it is essential to recommend a healthy diet consisting of iron-rich food sources. For cat B, focusing on incorporating foods with higher levels of iron, such as shellfish, red meats, seeds, nuts, legumes, and fortified breakfast cereals, would be crucial. For cat C, a balanced diet containing adequate amounts of these iron sources would suffice. Additionally, it is important to educate members of both categories about the importance of consuming vitamin C alongside iron-rich foods to enhance the absorption of iron by the body. This can be achieved through the inclusion of fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C, such as oranges, strawberries, bell peppers, and broccoli, in their daily diet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question \\"What will Carson want to do next?\\", is \\"likes to teach others how to bake\\" a valid answer? Select from: 1). Yes; 2). No; Answer:","completion":"2). No; The answer \\"likes to teach others how to bake\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Carson want to do next?\\" as it does not directly address Carson's subsequent actions or intentions after learning the basics of baking a cake from Sydney. The question asked about what Carson would want to do next after learning the cake baking basics from Sydney. A more appropriate answer would involve potential next steps, such as practicing their newly learned cake baking skills, attempting to bake another type of cake, or seeking additional guidance and instruction on more advanced baking techniques. Saying that Carson \\"likes to teach others how to bake\\" suggests a potential interest but does not logically follow as the next step for Carson right after learning the basics. It is also important to consider that the information provided indicates that Sydney taught Carson the basics of baking, but we do not know if Carson has mastered these skills. To presume that Carson would immediately want to teach others how to bake might not be a reasonable assumption, as it may take more time and practice for Carson to build their skills and confidence in baking. In conclusion, \\"likes to teach others how to bake\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will Carson want to do next?\\" following the given scenario. A valid answer should discuss the probable actions or intentions of Carson, such as further practice of newly learned skills, learning new recipes, or continuing to improve upon their baking abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. answer the following question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend?

The premise states that the sound of hobnailed boots clumping on the gravel outside signified the approach of Manning. According to this statement, there is a direct connection established between the sound of boots on the gravel and Manning's approach. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis that Manning's approach was signaled by boots on the gravel. In the premise, we are given specific details about the sound made by the boots: \\"clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside.\\" This paints a clear picture of how Manning's approach might be distinct from someone else's. Furthermore, the choice of the word \\"proclaimed\\" implies that the sound of the clumping boots was a highly noticeable event, making it more likely to be recognized as a signal of Manning's arrival.

TV programmes are like books and films. A child can learn bad things from some of them and good things from others. Some programmes help children know the news from the other parts of the world. Some programmes show people and places from other countries or other times in history. With TV, a child doesn't need to go to the zoo to see animals or to the sea to see a ship. Boys and girls can see a film, a play or a basketball match at home. Some programmes can teach children how to cook or how to use tools.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt. Question: \\"How did Europeans' and Americans' attitudes toward amassing wealth differ?\\" Answer: \\"Europeans had no interest in it, while Americans desired it\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct but lacks detail. To elaborate, Europeans, particularly the aristocracy, often took wealth for granted and found the pursuit of money to be crass and unbecoming. The lower classes in Europe generally had no hope of significantly increasing their wealth. In contrast, Americans valued the idea of amassing wealth through hard work and saw it as an achievable goal. This difference in attitudes towards wealth played a major role in shaping the social and cultural dynamics of these two societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Knocks him down","completion":"Title: The Hushed Truth Genre: Science fiction/Thriller Step 1: Establish the main character and world The story begins with Gang-du, a young, curious conspiracy theorist in the near future where technological advancements have reached impressive heights. Gang-du is a simple man from a small town, but he has an unshakable belief that there is a secret project going on in the shadows which could change the course of humanity forever. Step 2: Introduce the scientists conducting the secret project We are introduced to a group of scientists who are indeed working on a top-secret project – a powerful technology that could control human minds and alter their thoughts. Their aim is to maintain global peace and order; however, they are willing to go to any lengths to ensure that their project remains hidden from public scrutiny. Step 3: Gang-du discovers the secret project While snooping around on the internet, Gang-du discovers documents and electronic breadcrumbs that strongly suggest the existence of this secret project. As he delves deeper into the secrets, he realizes the vast and alarming implications of the project on humanity. Step 4: Gang-du tries to expose the truth Gang-du decides to expose the truth about the secret project through an online whistleblowing platform. However, the moment he publishes the information, he attracts the attention of the group of scientists. Step 5: The scientists plan to silence Gang-du Realizing that Gang-du could endanger their project, the scientists plan to silence him by knocking him down using their mind-control technology. They inject a nanotechnology serum into him that starts affecting the neural pathways in his brain. Step 6: Gang-du notices the effects Gradually, Gang-du senses that something is amiss with his body and mind. He witnesses his memories getting manipulated and his actions being involuntarily controlled, leading him into a spiral of doubt, paranoia, and fear. Step 7: Gang-du finds an ally In his quest to unravel the mystery, Gang-du encounters a former scientist named Dr. Park from the same research project who regrets her involvement. She decides to help Gang-du because she fears for her own life and believes that exposing the truth is the only way to stop the scientists. Step 8: Gang-du and Dr. Park gather evidence and prepare to fight Together, they collect damning evidence of the scientists' nefarious activities and assemble a team of resistance fighters. At the same time, they develop a strategy to neutralize the mind-controlling serum's effects within Gang-du. Step 9: Climactic confrontation In a thrilling battle of wits and will, Gang-du and his makeshift team of rebels confront the scientists at the project's secret facility. Despite the odds being in favor of the scientists, Gang-du's determination and the newly discovered counter-serum enable them to turn the tide and ultimately defeat the corrupted scientific group. Step 10: Resolution and hope for the future With the defeat of the sinister project and the restoration of Gang-du's normal mental state, the world remains oblivious to the potential chaos that has been averted. Although the truth never sees the light of day, Gang-du and his allies find solace knowing that they have safeguarded humanity's freedom. As the story concludes, Gang-du continues his search for any hidden conspiracies, ever vigilant for the next threat that might endanger the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative.

We can interpret the intended meaning of the premise in the following way: There is a possibility that the film has won the Best Picture award. However, the premise does not make any clear statement about its chances of winning the Best Director award. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis proposed by the user is accurate or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City. Which city experiences less energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","completion":"Kansas City experiences less energy release because of rocks breaking as compared to Tokyo due to the significant difference in the number of earthquakes that occur in the two cities. Tokyo is situated in an area with high seismological activity as it lies at the meeting point of four of Earth's tectonic plates; namely the Pacific Plate, the Philippine Sea Plate, the Eurasian Plate, and the North American Plate. This location makes Tokyo more prone to earthquakes as the movement of these plates generates stress within the Earth's crust, which in turn leads to the formation and subsequent rupture of faults that cause earthquakes. Kansas City, on the other hand, is located in the stable interior of the North American Plate, far away from any tectonic plate boundaries. This means that the city is far less prone to earthquakes as compared to Tokyo. While Kansas City has experienced some earthquakes in the past, they are rare, and their intensity is relatively lower when compared to earthquakes in Tokyo. When rocks break during an earthquake, they release a significant amount of energy in the form of seismic waves. During this process, the amount of energy released is directly proportional to the intensity and frequency of earthquakes occurring in a particular region. Since Tokyo experiences more and stronger earthquakes than Kansas City, it is safe to conclude that the energy released due to rocks breaking is comparatively higher in Tokyo than in Kansas City. In summary, Kansas City experiences less energy release because of rocks breaking, while Tokyo experiences a higher amount of energy release due to the increased frequency and intensity of earthquakes as a result of its location on the intersection of multiple tectonic plates. By understanding the seismological differences between the two cities, one can better plan for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies to protect the residents and infrastructures in both regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown. - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively. - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name. - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849 February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. - The Blue Carpet is a piece of Public Art in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, designed by Thomas Heatherwick. Although classified as a piece of public art, it is closer to an urban design feature. The piece occupies a public open space in front of the Laing Art Gallery, close to the main shopping and nightclub areas. - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century. - Charles William Mitchell ( 1854 -- 1903 ) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle . A contemporary of John William Waterhouse , his work is similar in many ways . His one famous piece was Hypatia , shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the Charles Kingsley serialized novel Hypatia or New Foes with an Old Face . This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery . - The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is a department of the United Kingdom government, with responsibility for culture and sport in England, and some aspects of the media throughout the whole UK, such as broadcasting and internet. - The Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, is located on New Bridge Street. The gallery was designed in the Baroque style with Art Nouveau elements by architects Cackett and Burns Dick and is now a Grade II listed building.

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819 23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist. He is particularly associated with Christian socialism, the working men's college, and forming labour cooperatives that failed but led to the working reforms of the progressive era. He was a friend and correspondent with Charles Darwin. - The Working Men's College (or WMC), is among the earliest adult education institutions established in the United Kingdom, and Europe's oldest extant centre for adult education. Founded by Christian Socialists, at its inception it was at the forefront of liberal education philosophy. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - Newcastle upon Tyne, commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county of itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974. The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. Newcastle also houses Newcastle University, a member of the Russell Group, as well as Northumbria University. - Christian socialism is a form of religious socialism based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Many Christian socialists believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in greed, which some Christian denominations consider a mortal sin. Christian socialists identify the cause of inequality to be the greed that they associate with capitalism. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general. The term is often used to refer to secular political organisations, meaning that they encompass a broad range of opinion. - Hypatia (\\"Hupatía\\"; born 35070; died 415), often called Hypatia of Alexandria, was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Byzantine Empire.

Movie title: The Passion of the Christ Movie plot: The film opens in Gethsemane during the night as Jesus Christ (Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John (James' brother) sleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. Caiaphas brings Jesus before...

Researchers from George Washington University exposed white blood cells taken from vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals and exposed them to HIV. In the smallpox-vaccinated cells, HIV replicated itself significantly slower than in those from non-vaccinated persons, Science Daily reports. The findings support a theory for the rise of HIV/AIDS, particularly in Africa: that the \\"defeat\\" of smallpox and subsequent decrease in vaccinations in the late '70s played a role. The possibility of using the vaccine to combat HIV is tempting, but the lead researcher advises caution. \\"While these results are very interesting and hopefully may lead to a new weapon against the HIV pandemic, it is far too soon to recommend the general use of vaccinia immunization for fighting HIV.\\" Check out the original scientific paper in the journal BMC Immunology here.","completion":"Once upon a time, some smart scientists from George Washington University did an experiment to see if a vaccine that protects against a bad germ called smallpox could also help protect against another bad germ called HIV. They took white blood cells from people who had the smallpox vaccine and from people who didn't. They mixed the blood with HIV germs to see what would happen. The scientists discovered that in the blood from people who had the smallpox vaccine, the HIV germs didn't grow as fast as in the blood from people without the vaccine. This is important because HIV can make people very sick, especially in a place called Africa. Some people think that when smallpox went away and people stopped getting the vaccine, it might have made it easier for HIV to spread. Even though this could be a new way to help fight HIV, the head scientist says they need to be careful and do more research before they start giving the smallpox vaccine to lots of people again.

Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Two groups of people when to the doctor. Group A had myopia, while group B had nearsightedness. Both groups got eyeglasses for their conditions. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had their people inherit their condition? Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","completion":"Group A had myopia, which is the condition that appears to have a hereditary component. As mentioned in the hint, there is some evidence that myopia is inherited, and if one or both parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that the individual will need them too. Although nearsightedness, which Group B had, can also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions like diabetes, it is not specifically linked to inheritance.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their frustration and disappointment with the product in several ways: 1. The title of the review, \\"This sucks!!!\\", immediately shows that the reviewer's experience with the product was negative and left a strong impression of dissatisfaction. 2. The first sentence highlights that the reviewer spent a significant amount of money on the product, which raises expectations for its performance and quality. 3. The fact that the product was a Christmas gift for the reviewer's wife adds an emotional aspect to the review, as it's an important occasion and the failure of the product might have spoiled the experience. 4. The product malfunctioned after only one day of use, which indicates poor quality and reliability, ultimately making the reviewer feel angry and mad. 5. The mention of a reading error and the unit's inability to turn the disc reveals specific problems with the product's functionality, further emphasizing the reviewer's negative experience. 6. The reviewer's suggestion to not purchase the system and to look for another one is a strong indicator that they don't recommend the product to others, reinforcing the unflattering depiction. 7. The comparison of purchasing the system to playing the lottery implies that the product's reliability is a gamble, with many other one-star reviews supporting the notion that these issues are not isolated incidents. Overall, the review paints a strongly unflattering picture of the product and would likely discourage potential buyers from considering it as an option. The reviewer's use of emphatic language, personal experience, and references to other negative reviews contributes to the unfavorable portrayal of the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the hunting strategies of both the Simba pack and the Mobutu pack. Step 1: Understand hunting strategies Simba pack: Ambushing wounded individual prey animals. Mobutu pack: Following large groups of zebras and other grazers. Step 2: Identify factors that affect hunting difficulty The difficulty in targeting prey animals can be influenced by several factors: - Ability to find wounded or weakened prey: Wounded animals are easier to catch because of their limited mobility. - Competition with other predators: More predators targeting the same prey will increase the difficulty of capturing them. - Number of available prey animals: Larger groups of prey animals can make it more difficult to single out an individual target. Step 3: Analyze the factors in relation to the hunting strategies of each pack Simba pack: - Since it's targeting wounded prey, it may have an easier time capturing the animals due to their limited mobility. - However, there might be other predators targeting the same wounded animals, which could make it more difficult. - If there are few wounded animals, it might take longer for the pack to find a suitable target. Mobutu pack: - Following large groups of prey animals may make it more difficult to single out a target since they have multiple options. - On the other hand, they have a larger pool of prey animals to choose from. - Other predators might also be attracted to the large groups of zebras and grazers, making the task more difficult. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it seems that the Mobutu pack may have more difficulty targeting prey animals. While the Simba pack targets already wounded individuals, which are easier to catch, the Mobutu pack has to navigate large groups of zebras and grazers, making it more challenging to single out a target. Additionally, the competition with other predators attracted to the large groups of prey may further increase the difficulty for the Mobutu pack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, the second sentence uses a comma before \\"and Indigenous knowledge\\" (an instance of an Oxford comma), whereas the first sentence omits it. Despite these small variations, the core message remains the same. To provide a deeper understanding of the disciplines mentioned, let us briefly discuss them: 1. Archaeoastronomy: This discipline involves the study of how ancient cultures observed and utilized astronomical phenomena, focusing on their beliefs, rituals, and myths associated with the sky and celestial objects. 2. Ethnoastronomy: Ethnoastronomy examines the astronomical knowledge of present-day indigenous and traditional cultures, aiming to understand the significance and impact of the sky and celestial objects on these societies. 3. Historical Astronomy: This branch of cultural astronomy revolves around the study of how human understanding of astronomy has evolved throughout history, taking into account the development of astronomical concepts, methods, tools, and observations in different periods. 4. Geomythology: Geomythology explores the relationship between ancient myths, legends, and folklore with geological and astronomical events. This involves investigating possible connections between these stories and actual natural phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or meteor impacts. 5. Indigenous Knowledge: Focusing on the traditional wisdom and practices accumulated by indigenous communities, this area of study seeks to preserve and integrate the valuable knowledge these cultures possess, particularly when it comes to understanding the natural environment, including astronomical observations and beliefs. In conclusion, although there are slight differences in the structure and punctuation of the two sentences, the essential meaning remains the same, describing the comprehensive nature of cultural astronomy research that spans across various interdisciplinary fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beer contains ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening).

Q:Question: Who does the family hope will return? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Testament Context: The Wetherly familyâhusband Tom (William Devane), wife Carol (Jane Alexander), and children Brad (Ross Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas) -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin, California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works. On a routine afternoon, Carol (a stay-at-home mom and volunteer for school functions such as directing the school play) listens to an answering-machine message from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame Street on TV as Brad adjusts the TV antenna on the roof, when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; suddenly, a San Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New York signal and there were explosions of \\"nuclear devices there in New York, and up and down the East Coast.\\" The anchorman is cut off by the Emergency Broadcast System tone with the Civil Defense Insignia being shown on the Screen, then an announcer's voice states that the White House is interrupting the program: \\"Please stand by for the President and do not use the telephone.\\" At the introduction of the President of the United States (who is never seen; only the Presidential Seal is shown on the TV), the phone rings but it goes dead along with the TV and electricity just as Carol answers it. Suddenly, the blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is then seen through the window. The family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are running around on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family hopes Tom will return, but the circumstances are hard to ignore. The suburb of Hamelin survives relatively unscathed, because apparently the town is far enough from San Francisco to avoid blast damage. Frightened residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart (Leon Ames), an elderly ham radio operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas and internationally, and tells Carol that he was unable to reach anyone east of Keokuk, Iowa; a...

Title: To put it simply - fabulous Review: Erikson creates a world of such rich content, that one book is insufficient to hold in all of it. To a certain extent, many fantasy creations feel spare - the writer creates the present story, but the past is nearly absent. Not Erikson - the ancient history which gives the book it's scope logically influences the present situation, in matters great and small.

On the contrary, it is a highly positive review praising the rich content, well-developed history, and compelling characters present in Erikson's book. The reviewer enthusiastically recommends the book to others who enjoy immersive storytelling, showcasing their appreciation for the author's capability to draw readers into the world they have created. The use of words like \\"fabulous,\\" \\"rich,\\" \\"pleasure to behold,\\" and \\"strongly recommend\\" emphasizes the reviewer's positive experience and admiration for the book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Options are: (A). negative; (B). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? brian tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky 's excellent music","completion":"The phrase you presented, \\"Brian Tufano's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky's excellent music,\\" would be considered (B). positive. This statement does not have any negative connotations and instead praises both Brian Tufano and Paul Grabowsky for their artistic contributions. The use of positive adjectives like \\"handsome\\" and \\"excellent\\" to describe Tufano's photography and Grabowsky's music signifies appreciation and admiration for their work. In evaluating content or text, you can look at the choice of words, the overall tone, and the conveyed sentiment. Here, 'handsome' and 'excellent' suggest a positive assessment. 'Handsome' is often used to imply that something is impressive or looks good. Here, it's applied to Brian Tufano's widescreen photography, implying that his work on the visual aspects of what might be a movie or a project is particularly notable. This likely includes aspects such as composition, lighting, and choice of perspectives. Likewise, 'excellent' is a term used to express high quality with no negatives attached to it—which in this context, is associated with Paul Grabowsky's music. When we say someone's work is excellent, we imply it has met or surpassed the usually high standards of quality. That certainly is a positive impression. Additionally, the context is also important to consider when determining whether a sentence is positive or negative. In this case, the context is about how well one person's photography and another person's music have been executed and perceived, which doesn't leave room for negative interpretation based on the given information. Therefore, the statement is complimenting and appreciating the work of these two individuals and carries a positive sentiment or tone.

How to know if your pet is in pain?","completion":"Though the two questions asked are syntactically different, they both essentially inquire about the same topic, which is identifying signs of pain in pets. The first question, \\"How can you tell when your pet is in pain?\\" follows a more conversational tone, while the second question, \\"How to know if your pet is in pain?\\" is more direct and structured. Here is a detailed and long answer to address both questions: Pets are experts in hiding pain because, in the wild, animals showing weakness often become the target of predators. As a result, identifying pain indicators in pets can be challenging for pet owners. However, being knowledgeable about the subtle signs of pain can help you notice pain/problems in your pet and take action quickly. There are several common indicators to look for if you suspect your pet is in pain: 1. Behavioral changes: If your pet starts acting out of character, it could be a sign of discomfort. For instance, a pet that is usually social and playful may become withdrawn or lethargic. On the contrary, a pet in pain may seem more clingy, anxious, or even aggressive. 2. Vocalization: Pets may vocalize more or less than usual when in pain. This may include whimpering, whining, growling, yelping, or even purring in cats. Pay close attention to sudden changes in the vocalizations your pet makes or if the sounds are more persistent than usual. 3. Changes in mobility: If your pet has difficulty moving, getting up, or lying down, it might be a sign of pain. Pets may also limp or favor one side when walking or be more reluctant in engaging in physical activities they used to enjoy. 4. Grooming habits: Over-grooming in one specific area or general lack of grooming altogether may be signs of pain. Cats, for example, might excessively lick a painful area or develop matted fur when in pain. 5. Changes in eating and drinking habits: Pain can lead to a decreased appetite and thirst. If your pet is eating or drinking less than usual, or if they are having difficulty chewing or swallowing, it could be an indication of an underlying problem. 6. Altered sleep patterns: Pets in pain may sleep more than usual or have disrupted sleep due to discomfort. A sudden increase or decrease in the amount of time spent sleeping should warrant further evaluation. 7. Unusual body posture: A pet in pain may assume an unusual position, such as the \\"prayer position\\" in dogs, where they stretch the front legs and lay their chest on the floor while keeping their hindquarters elevated. Cats may hunch their backs or sit with their front paws tucked under, adopting a guarded posture. 8. Changes in facial expression: A pet's facial expression can sometimes provide clues about their level of discomfort. For example, dogs may display \\"whale eyes\\" (exposing the white part around the iris) or pin their ears back when in pain. 9. Swelling or inflammation: Painful areas in your pet's body may become swollen, red, or feel hot to the touch. 10. Breathing changes: Rapid or shallow breathing, panting (especially in cats), or the inability to catch their breath could also indicate pain. Remember that these signs could be symptoms of various conditions that require professional evaluation. Make sure to consult with a veterinarian if you notice any of these signs so they can assess your pet's health and recommend appropriate measures for pain management or treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:The Ogre doesn't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988, and I guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'Demons 3' in order to help it sell better. Well, the film is directed by Lamberto Bava; the man behind the first two Demons films, and ogres and demons are somewhat alike (in that they're both 'monsters' anyway)...but other than that, this film has no connections to the other two films. It is, however, rather good! Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films, and while it's not completely obvious; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from Hellraiser. The plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in Italy. She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement. It's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return...and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there's a murderous ogre living in the basement.The film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for Italian TV, so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; but for what it is, this is certainly a very decent horror film. Lamberto Bava may not have as keen an eye as his father Mario did; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well. The central setting, a large castle, makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and Lamberto makes the best of it; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times; such as the Inferno-style pool scene. The plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange (particularly between the husband and wife). There's not a great deal of bloodshed, but Bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects. The ogre itself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't get to see it very often. We do boil down to a fitting, if highly predictable, ending and overall I have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended. Solution:","completion":"Based on the content of the movie review, I would classify it as positive. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's limited budget and connection to the Demons franchise, yet still appreciates the film for what it is.

WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Here's a breakdown of the aspects that contribute to the rating: 1. Clarity and Descriptiveness: The review simply states \\"Valuable app Any time.\\" From this, it can be inferred that the user found the app valuable and useful at any time, but there isn't much detail to understand why the app is considered valuable or what specific features the user enjoyed. Providing examples or highlighting certain aspects of the app would have greatly improved the clarity of the review. This warrants a score of 1.5. 2. Constructiveness: Reviews generally work best when they provide constructive feedback, either positive or negative, regarding specific aspects of the app. This helps other users understand what to expect from the experience, while also aiding developers in improving their applications. In this case, the review only offers a general statement of appreciation, without any actionable insights. This aspect scores a 1. 3. Tone: The tone of the review is positive, which is favorable considering that it suggests the user enjoyed their experience with the app. The use of the phrase \\"Valuable app\\" contributes to creating a positive impression of the product. This aspect warrants a score of 3.5. 4. Helpfulness: When considering helpfulness, a review would ideally help others make an informed decision about whether to download the app or not. This review doesn't provide enough context or detail to help potential users decide if the app meets their needs or preferences, which makes this aspect less helpful. This warrants a score of 2. Upon evaluating these factors, I would rate this review a 2.25 out of 5. Although it is a positive review, the lack of detail, descriptiveness, and constructiveness limits its value as a useful and informative source for potential users or for the app's developers.

Article: As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent all around the world. There is little doubt that the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is a major part of modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications. Now answer this question: Other than being cheaper, what is another main draw of processed foods?","completion":"Another main draw of processed foods, apart from being cheaper, is their convenience. This convenience comes in various forms, such as easier purchasing, storage, and preparation. In terms of purchasing, processed foods are widely available in most supermarkets and grocery stores, often taking up a significant portion of shelf space. This high availability makes them easily accessible for consumers, who can quickly grab them without having to spend time searching for specific items. When it comes to storage, processed foods usually have a longer shelf-life compared to fresh, whole foods. They often contain preservatives and are packaged in a way to prevent spoilage, allowing them to be stored for extended periods without losing their quality or taste. This feature is particularly appealing to consumers with busy lifestyles or limited access to fresh produce markets, as they can stock up on processed foods and consume them over time without worrying about food waste due to spoilage. In the context of preparation, processed foods are often designed to be quick and easy to prepare with minimal effort, skill, or time invested. Many of these foods come pre-cooked or partially prepared and only require heating or simple assembly before consumption. Examples include microwaveable meals, instant noodles, and canned soups. The convenience of these foods makes them especially attractive to individuals with limited cooking skills or those who are time-poor, such as working parents, students, or single adults. In summary, besides being cheaper, the convenience offered by processed foods in terms of purchasing, storage, and preparation is another main draw that contributes to their widespread consumption. However, this convenience often comes at the cost of lower nutritional quality, which may lead to negative health implications for consumers in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - good book - bus stop - post office - triangle - graph I believe the correct choice is \\"post office\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"Indeed, the correct choice in this context is \\"post office.\\" Here's why: When it is cold outside, the primary concern in this question is finding a location where you can stay warm without relying on a coat. In this list of choices, a \\"good book,\\" \\"triangle,\\" and \\"graph\\" are not physical locations that would provide shelter or warmth. While they could serve as distractions to help pass the time, they do nothing to address the issue of staying warm in cold weather. On the other hand, \\"bus stop\\" could be a potentially relevant option since bus stops may offer some protection from wind and precipitation. However, many bus stops are still open to the elements, making them not ideal for keeping warm without a coat. The most practical choice, then, is the \\"post office.\\" Post offices are typically indoors, providing shelter from the cold and an environment that is climate-controlled. By standing inside a post office, you would not need a coat to keep warm since the building itself protects you from the cold outside. In conclusion, if you're in a line and want to stay warm without wearing a coat in cold weather, the best place to be is inside a post office. Not only does it provide shelter and warmth, but it is also a secure location where you can conduct essential mailing services or pick up packages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"apan is used for cooking food by heating food in it on a stove\\" and \\"an egg is being cooked if it is in the frying pan\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What can be used to cook eggs?\\" would be a combination of options: G). the stove and D). the spatula. Cooking an egg in a frying pan requires both a stove to provide heat and a spatula to handle the egg during the cooking process. A stove, or cooking range, is a kitchen appliance designed for cooking food by supplying heat through various methods, such as electric coils or gas burners. When an egg is placed in a frying pan, the stove generates the necessary heat that allows the egg to be cooked. In addition, a spatula is an essential utensil used for flipping, lifting, or moving the egg within the frying pan, ensuring even cooking and preventing it from sticking to the pan's surface. The spatula can also be used to transfer the cooked egg from the frying pan onto a plate safely. Let's now discuss why the other options are not the most suitable answer. A). Direct energy refers to energy that is directly converted to heat, electricity, or kinetic energy. While it might generate heat in certain instances, it is not specifically related to cooking eggs. B). The egg timer is a tool used to measure time when boiling eggs to achieve desired consistency, and is not directly related to cooking eggs in a frying pan. C). Fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction and are not directly involved in cooking eggs. E). The fridge is an appliance that stores and preserves food at low temperatures, and its purpose is not to cook food, including eggs. F). Oysters are a type of shellfish and are not used for cooking eggs. H). Electricity is an energy form that can power a stove, but on its own, it is not enough to cook the eggs, as a stove and spatula are still needed. In conclusion, based on the teacher's hints, the best answer to the quiz question is the combination of options G). the stove and D). the spatula, as they are essential tools for cooking eggs in a frying pan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. Why did Moore quote the bible? A. he wants to appear more likable B. he is deeply religious C. he is playing to his base D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"C. Roy Moore quoted the Bible in his speech because he is playing to his base. Moore is known for his staunch conservative and religious beliefs, and his support primarily comes from evangelical Christians. By referencing a passage from the Bible, Moore aimed to connect with his voter base on a religious and emotional level. While it is possible that he is also deeply religious (option B), the primary reason for quoting the Bible in this context is to appeal to his supporters and maintain a connection with them, even in defeat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a disappointing loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked to bounce back against the lowly Vikings who were without Adrian Peterson who was suspended, but were led by ex-Patriot Matt Cassel at quarterback. The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be.

Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. and a hint : Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Please answer this question : Which lake will have more algae? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Lake Mahoe will likely have more algae. This is because it is located right next to a large farm that grows various crops, so there is a higher chance of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, being washed into the lake due to rainwater runoff. These dissolved fertilizers can cause an excessive growth of water plants and algae, leading to problems like dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive.

To do that, we will add 8*m to both sides of the equation (because -8*m + 8*m equals 0). -25*m + 8*m = -8*m + 8*m - 85 Now, it becomes: -17*m = -85 Next, we need to find the value of 'm' by dividing both sides of the equation by -17 (because -17*m divided by -17 equals m). -17*m / -17 = -85 / -17 Now the equation becomes: m = 5 So, the value of 'm' is 5!

Answer the following question: Information: - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Lucius Licinius Lucullus (118 57/56 BC) was an \\"optimate\\" politician of the late Roman Republic, closely connected with Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In the culmination of over twenty years of almost continuous military and government service, he became the main conqueror of the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship in diverse situations, most famously during the siege of Cyzicus, 73-72 BC, and at the Battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene, 69 BC. His command style received unusually favourable attention from ancient military experts, and his campaigns appear to have been studied as examples of skillful generalship. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - There were three Mithridatic Wars between Rome and the Kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC. They are named for Mithridates VI who was King of Pontus at the time. - The Kingdom of Pontus or Pontic Empire was a state founded by the Persian Mithridatic dynasty, which may have been directly related to Darius the Great and the Achaemenid dynasty. The kingdom was proclaimed by Mithridates I in 281BCE and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63BCE. It reached its largest extent under Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos, and for a brief time the Roman province of Asia. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic Wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province Bithynia et Pontus, and the eastern half survived as a client kingdom. - Mithra (\\"Mira\\", \\"Miça\\") is the Zoroastrian angelic Divinity (\\"yazata\\") of Covenant and Oath. In addition to being the Divinity of Contracts, Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing Protector of Truth, and the Guardian of Cattle, the Harvest and of The Waters. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories. - A consul was the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic, and the consulship was considered the highest level of the \\"cursus honorum\\" (the sequential order of public offices through which aspiring politicians sought to ascend). - Lucius Licinius Murena was Roman consul in 62 BC. His father had the same name. - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Second Mithridatic War ( 83 -- 81 BC ) was one of three wars fought between Pontus and the Roman Republic . The second Mithridatic war was fought between King Mithridates VI of Pontus and the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena . At the conclusion of the First Mithridatic War , Sulla had come to a hasty agreement with Mithridates that allowed the latter to remain in control of his Kingdom of Pontus , but relinquishing his claim to Asia Minor and respecting pre-war borders . Murena , as Sulla 's legate , was stationed in Asia as commander of the two legions formerly under the command of Gaius Flavius Fimbria . Murena invaded Pontus on his own authority claiming that Mithridates was re-arming and posed a direct threat to Roman Asia Minor . After several inconclusive skirmishes , Mithridates inflicted a minor defeat on Murena and forced his withdrawal from Pontus . Peace was restored on the orders of Sulla . This was followed by the Third Mithridatic War . - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. What is the relationship between 'second mithridatic war' and 'conflict'? Answer:","completion":"The Second Mithridatic War is an example of a conflict. A conflict refers to a struggle, disagreement, or fight between opposing forces or parties, usually involving military actions. In the context of the Second Mithridatic War, the conflict was fought between King Mithridates VI of Pontus and the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena. This war was one of three Mithridatic Wars between Pontus and the Roman Republic, involving various military engagements and skirmishes, all of which are examples of conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement \\"How about the Ritz?\\" does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the hypothesis that \\"The Ritz is better than the other options.\\" This is because the speaker is merely suggesting the Ritz as an option, without providing comparative information regarding the quality, benefits, features, or services offered by the Ritz as compared to alternative options.

MP John Whittingdale said \\"it would be better\\" not to play it, while DJ Paul Gambaccini insisted: \\"It's not something to editorialise about.\\" A Radio 1 spokesman said a decision would be made \\"when the final chart positions were clear\\". \\"This is an attempt to manipulate the charts by people trying to make a political point,\\" Mr Whittingdale, who is chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, told the Daily Mail \\"Most people find that offensive and deeply insensitive.\\" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, music critic Neil McCormick opined that \\"there is no reason for the BBC to risk upsetting many listeners just to satisfy a few troublemakers\\". The paper also quoted former Conservative Party chairman Lord McAlpine, who said he was \\"absolutely astounded\\" the corporation was \\"even considering playing it\\". But Conservative MP Philip Davies said: 'It's a chart programme so if it's top of the charts they have to play it. It's not for the BBC to define on what basis something is in the charts.\\" During a visit to Oxfordshire on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he did not feel the online campaign was \\"in very good taste at all\\" but that it was not for politicians \\"to start telling the BBC what songs they broadcast\\". \\"Whatever your views are about the song or the campaign, or indeed about Margaret Thatcher, I really don't think we should start telling broadcasters what songs they should play,\\" he told BBC South Today. A number of media experts have told the BBC the Wizard of Oz track should be played, particularly if it charts inside the Top 10. They include Trevor Dann, the BBC's former head of music entertainment, who said he could not see \\"any reason\\" why it should not be played. \\"The chart is almost like a news programme; it's a programme of record,\\" he said. \\"It's not for the BBC to judge if it's an appropriate record for people to buy and therefore for them to play.\\" His position was echoed by radio consultant John Myers, who felt it should be played provided there was no reference to the campaign surrounding it. \\"If you set up a chart show to play the nation's most purchased or downloaded songs, that's what you have to play,\\" said Mr Myers, a former chief executive of the Radio Academy. \\"You don't have to say why people have bought it, but you do have to play it.\\" Perhaps the highest profile track to be banned by the BBC in recent years was Frankie Goes to Hollywood's debut single Relax, following its release in 1984. Then Radio 1 DJ Mike Read was playing the thumping dance anthem on his Radio 1 chart show and removed the needle from the record midway through the song when the sexual nature of the lyrics suddenly dawned on him. Read branded the record \\"obscene\\", vowing never to play it again, with the rest of the BBC swiftly following his lead. But the airplay ban only served to increase the notoriety and popularity of the record and it went on to occupy the number one spot for five weeks, without the BBC's help. When Frankie Goes to Hollywood's follow-up single Two Tribes went to number one, Relax climbed back up the charts to number two. Later that year the ban was finally lifted and Relax featured on the Christmas Top of the Pops and Radio 1's countdown of the year's best-selling records. Journalist and DJ Paul Gambaccini has expressed a similar opinion, telling BBC WM that the programme was \\"not a programme of choice\\". \\"The Top 40 is the news of music,\\" he went on. \\"It's not something to editorialise about - it's just fact. You can't change reality.\\" \\"I feel utterly sorry for all the chart shows,\\" added Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch UK, a group that campaigns for family values in the media. \\"It's put them in a really invidious position. \\"But chart shows exist to play the most bought or downloaded songs, and to change that is to interfere with a democratic process.\\" The track is also number one in the Capital Chart's Big Top 40. Earlier this week, its sponsor Vodafone said: \\"We simply sponsor the chart itself, we don't pass comment on the tracks it contains.\\" A spokesman for Capital FM said the station was currently \\"reviewing the situation\\". Asked to comment on the subject earlier this week by BBC staff, the corporation's new director general Tony Hall said he found the campaign \\"pretty tasteless\\". \\"But let's see,\\" he continued. \\"If there's an editorial reason for saying it's number one, or it's the fastest riser, this week, we'll have to rethink.\\" Greg Dyke, a former director general of the BBC, said Lady Thatcher herself would have found the idea of not playing the track \\"ridiculous\\". \\"If they don't play it they are making a political statement,\\" he told Newsbeat's Chi Chi Izundu. The original track was performed in the 1939 Judy Garland film by characters celebrating the demise of the much-hated Wicked Witch of the East. Opponents of Margaret Thatcher have been buying copies of the song following the former Prime Minister's death on Monday at the age of 87. According to the Official Charts Company, Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead is currently on course to claim the number three placing in Sunday's countdown. Meanwhile, an alternative online campaign has been launched to push the Notsensibles' light-hearted punk track I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher to number one. The single was initially released in 1980, following the former PM's election victory. In 1977 the BBC refused to play God Save the Queen by the Sex Pistols when it charted during the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations.","completion":"Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead, a song from the Wizard of Oz, could potentially chart within the top five on Sunday due to a politically motivated online campaign following the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Some politicians, such as MP John Whittingdale, believe it would be in poor taste for the BBC to play the song, calling it offensive and deeply insensitive. Others argue that if the song makes it to the top of the charts, the BBC should not interfere with the democratic process and should play it. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg stated that while he found the campaign to be in poor taste, politicians should not dictate what songs broadcasters play. Media experts have also weighed in, with some, including the BBC's former head of music entertainment, Trevor Dann, asserting that the chart show should play the song if it reaches a top position, as it is a record of the nation's most purchased or downloaded songs. Radio consultant John Myers agrees, stating that the BBC can play the song without mentioning the political context behind its popularity. The debate over whether or not to play the song highlights the ongoing issue of the BBC's role in shaping public discourse through its editorial decisions. Some individuals, including journalist and DJ Paul Gambaccini, have called for the BBC to stay objective and report on popular culture without injecting personal or political opinions. Vivienne Pattison, from Mediawatch UK, a group campaigning for family values in media, argues that interfering with chart shows goes against the democratic process. Regardless of the outcome of this particular case, the debate over the BBC's role in shaping public opinion and taste is likely to continue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is the text with appropriate spaces added between the words: Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994, established a system of Community plant variety rights as the sole and exclusive form of Community industrial property rights for new plant varieties. To provide further context, this regulation was enacted within the European Union (EU) to protect the rights of breeders developing new plant varieties. The regulation sets up a system that grants certain exclusive rights to these breeders, fostering innovation and growth in the agricultural and horticultural sectors. Under this legislation, the following key aspects are addressed: 1. Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94: This is the specific regulation that establishes the legal framework for plant variety rights within the European Union. 2. 27 July 1994: This is the date on which the regulation was enacted. 3. Community Plant Variety Rights (CPVR): This system provides breeders of new plant varieties with the exclusive right to exploit their creation, offering a means of intellectual property protection for plant breeders in the European Community. 4. Sole and exclusive form of Community industrial property rights: The regulation emphasizes that the Community Plant Variety Rights system is the only form of industrial property rights related to new plant varieties within the EU. This prevents any overlap or conflict with other forms of intellectual property protection, such as patents or trademarks. 5. New plant varieties: This regulation specifically targets new plant varieties that are distinct, uniform, and stable as defined by the legislation. In order to qualify for protection, the variety must be new, meaning it has not been commercialized before the relevant time period and it must possess characteristics that set it apart from other known varieties. In conclusion, the Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994 established a system of Community plant variety rights within the European Union.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .","completion":"The phrase \\"works spectacularly well ... a shiver-inducing, nerve-rattling ride\\" would be considered positive. Analyzing the keywords and expressions used will help to understand the overall sentiment and tone of the statement, which in this case, leans towards a positive evaluation. First, the adverb \\"spectacularly\\" suggests that whatever is being discussed is impressive and exceptional. The word \\"well\\" has a positive connotation, indicating that something is performing or functioning effectively. Combining these two words, \\"spectacularly well\\" implies that whatever is being referred to is not only working efficiently but doing so in an outstanding manner. Next, the phrase \\"shiver-inducing\\" relates to the ability to cause shivers or involuntary shuddering, usually due to excitement, anticipation, or intensity. This descriptive phrase can be perceived as positive, implying that the experience or effect is powerful, thrilling, and emotionally engaging. Finally, \\"nerve-rattling\\" could be interpreted as a description of an intense and possibly even stressful experience. However, when included as part of this statement, it seems to imply excitement or an adrenaline rush, rather than a negative sense of anxiety or discomfort. The use of “ride” also suggests that the subject is being compared to a thrilling and exhilarating experience, similar to an amusement park ride that is meant to be enjoyable and stimulating. Considering the individual elements and expressions used in the statement, the overall sentiment is positive, as the keywords accentuate excitement, exhilaration, and high quality.

This will be represented with two columns: one for the number of coffee purchases and another for legal consultations. Step 3: Analyze the Data We can calculate the average number of people who received both coffee and legal advice daily using the data collected. This number will help us determine if the hypothesis holds true. Step 4: Draw Conclusion Compare the average number of customers receiving coffee and legal consultations against the hypothesis. If the average is close to 100 per day or reasonably close, we can accept the hypothesis as true. If the average customer count is significantly different from 100, the hypothesis may not be true. However, based on the given premise, we don't have enough information to conclude if the hypothesis is true or not. We first need to conduct the above steps to gather relevant data and analyze it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What did some plants produce when flowers became less simple? A: The first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: When flowers evolved to become less simple, it led to the development of more complex and diverse reproductive structures in plants. As flowers became less simple, some plants began to produce various traits and strategies to attract pollinators and ensure successful reproduction. This diversification can be seen in a number of ways within the more advanced flowering plant lineages: 1. Diversified colors and patterns: Through evolution, many plants developed intricate color patterns and hues on their petals to attract pollinators. Some even have ultraviolet patterns that are only visible to certain insects, allowing these plants to be even more selective with their preferred pollinators. 2. Varied shapes and sizes: While simple flowers generally have quite a straightforward design, more advanced flowers exhibit a wide range of shapes and sizes. This allows the plants to cater to specific pollinators, ensuring a more efficient and effective pollination process. For example, tube-shaped flowers are perfect for long-tongued pollinators like hummingbirds and butterflies, while open-faced flowers are easily accessible to bees and other insects. 3. Specialized floral structures: Some plants developed unique and specialized anatomical structures within their flowers to assist in the pollination process. These structures could be nectar reservoirs, specialized stamens, or petal arrangements to facilitate pollinator access or make it more difficult for unwanted visitors. 4. Scent production: As flowers became less simple, some plants evolved the ability to produce various scents or odors to attract pollinators toward them. These scents can range from sweet and alluring to highly pungent and repulsive, depending on the type of pollinator the plant is attempting to attract. 5. Temporal differentiation: In an effort to become more efficient at reproducing, some plants developed the ability to release their pollen and receptive stigma at different times, either as diurnal or nocturnal bloomers. This allows plants to avoid self-pollination, increasing genetic diversity and reducing the chances of inbreeding. 6. Adaptations for abiotic pollination: While biotic pollination through animal vectors is a common theme in more complex flowers, some advanced plants adapted to abiotic pollination methods, such as wind or water. These plants developed specialized structures, like wind-catching stamens, to ensure the successful transfer of pollen in the absence of animal pollinators. 7. Co-evolution with pollinators: As flowers became less simple, many plants and their pollinators developed mutualistic relationships promoting co-evolution. In these cases, the plant's reproductive structures evolved alongside specific pollinators' adaptations, like increased proboscis length or specialized mouthparts, to further enhance the efficiency of the pollination process. In summary, as flowers evolved to become less simple, plants developed a range of strategies and adaptations to maximize their reproductive success. These changes manifested through diverse colors, shapes, sizes, specialized structures, scent production, temporal differentiation, and co-evolution with their pollinators. These characteristics have made flowering plants one of the most diverse and successful groups of organisms on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Top free agents - FOX Sports Photo Gallery | FOX Sports on MSN Johan Santana, who didn't pitch in 2013 after having shoulder surgery in April, is among the interesting free-agent names this offseason. Declining the 25 million option on Santana, maybe the New York Mets are hoping to sign the two-time Cy Young winner to a low-risk deal? Meanwhile, there's some major All-Star talent on the market who would make an immediate impact with whichever team signs them. Click through this photo gallery for this offseason's top free agents. The nine-year veteran is the top-shelf item on the free-agent market. Cano is working with Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports agency, and reports have surfaced the five-time All-Star is seeking a deal in the 300 million range. It's hard to imagine Cano not in Yankees pinstripes, but it's a possibility.

He hit .500 (9 for 18) in the ALDS vs. Tampa Bay, and .318 (7 for 22) in the ALCS vs. Detroit. He led the postseason with 14 runs and six stolen bases. That's the same style of play the seven-year veteran brings to the ballpark everyday.

In 2013, the center fielder ranked second in the NL in on-base percentage, runs and walks and led the majors with 26 hit by pitches. The nine-year veteran would be a huge plus at the top of any lineup, but he won't come cheap.

He missed the first two months after breaking his forearm when hit by a pitch in the Yankees' first spring training game. Then in his eighth game back, he fractured his pinkie finger, returning to the DL until Aug. 2. When healthy, he's one of the top offensive center fielders in the game.

Beltran was a huge plus to the Cards his two years in St. Louis, but with his turning 37 in April and demanding more money than an average veteran slugger, it's unlikely he'll return.

Born in the Auckland suburb of Takapuna and raised in neighbouring Devonport, she became interested in performing as a child. In her early teens, she signed with Universal Music Group and was later paired with songwriter and record producer Joel Little. At the age of sixteen, she released her first extended play, The Love Club EP (2012), reaching number two on the national record charts in both New Zealand and Australia. \\" Context: In January 2016, Lorde purchased a 2.84 million home in Herne Bay, Auckland. At the 2016 Brit Awards, she gave a performance of \\"Life on Mars\\" in tribute to the late English singer David Bowie. According to Billboard, Lorde said she'd be writing new material in December 2013. While responding to a fan on her Instagram account in August 2016, she said that the record had been written and they were in production stages. In November, she posted a note on her Facebook account stating: \\"Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies, and this record - well, this one is about what comes next.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When your cat is still new to your home, lie down near it or in front of it when your paths cross. Speak to your kitten in a quiet, comforting voice, saying things like, “Hi, kitty. It's just me. You can trust me.” Soon, your cat will become interested in you and come over to give you a sniff. Repeat this exercise three or four time daily for a week or so. The exact distance away from your cat you should lie down varies depending on much your cat distrusts you. The less trust your cat has in you, the further away you will need to lie down in order to entice it to come near. It might take several exchanges before your cat actually gets interested in you enough to come over and see what you’re doing. Do not reach your hand out to the cat during this stage. Keep some treats handy as you walk around the house during the day. When you encounter the kitten that does not trust you, squat down on one knee. In a gentle voice, say, “Here, kitty. Would you like a treat?” Place a cat treat in the center of one upturned palm and extend it to the kitten. Repeat three or four times a day. At first, keep your arm extended out as far as you can. After a week or so, start to bring your arm in closer to your body. This will allow your cat to feel safer with you. This feeling of security will help you earn a kitten’s trust. At this point, reduce the number of times each day you give your kitten a treat to just one or two. After your kitten is comfortable eating from your hand in close proximity to your body, introduce a new element to the interaction. While your cat is nibbling the treat in one hand, bring your other hand up and stroke the cat gently from the top of its head or neck toward its tail. Smooth, steady strokes along its back will reassure your kitten and help you earn its trust. If you pick a kitten up before it trusts you, it will become startled. Only pick the kitten up after it trusts you enough to eat from your hand and allow you to pet it. When you lift your kitten, do so from the kitten’s left side. Cup your right hand under the right side of its body and support its chest with your right hand. Bring the kitten up against your chest where it will feel safe. Cross your left arm over your right to secure its body against yours. Holding your cat in this way can also help you earn its trust. Playtime is not just a fun distraction for both you and your kitten, but also an important bonding experience. To earn a kitten’s trust, wave a string toy near it, or flash a laser pointer across the floor in front of it. Your kitten will have great fun and will learn to associate you with happiness and all the other good feelings that make trust possible. If kittens are not raised with a wide variety of experiences, they will remain anxious and afraid when confronted by novel situations as they age. To prevent your kitten from developing an untrustworthy attitude, introduce it to tall people, short people, men and women, old people and young people. This will help break your cat of any prejudices that might prevent it from trusting you or others. If you do not have many friends or live alone, one way that you can socialize your kitten properly and thereby earn its trust is to leave the radio or television on during the day. This will allow your kitten to become accustomed to the sound of human speech.

Subtract 3578 from 992: 992 - 3578 = -2586 Now, the equation becomes: -862*g = -2586 Step 2: Solve for g. To solve for g, you'll need to isolate g by dividing both sides of the equation by -862. This will eliminate the coefficient of g, allowing you to find its value: (-862 * g) / -862 = -2586 / -862 Since both -862 and -2586 are negative numbers, dividing them will produce a positive result.

It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are asking about the cost of knee replacement surgery in two different locations: Europe and Mexico. Allow me to provide detailed information on each location. 1. Knee replacement surgery cost in Europe: The cost of knee replacement surgery in Europe varies depending on the country and the hospital. The European Union comprises 27 countries, and healthcare costs differ from one country to another. The total expense for knee replacement surgery can include consultation fees, surgeon fees, anesthesia charges, medications, hospital stay, and rehabilitation costs. In general, the prices range from 10,000 to 40,000 (USD). However, this is just an approximate estimation, and the actual costs might differ. Here's a rough breakdown of knee replacement costs in some European countries: - United Kingdom: 12,000 to 20,000 (NHS offers free surgery for eligible citizens) - Spain: 15,000 to 25,000 - Germany: 18,000 to 22,000 - France: 12,000 to 17,000 - Poland: 8,000 to 12,000 These costs are subject to change, and the quality of treatment may vary across different medical institutions. It is essential to research and choose a reputable facility for the surgery. 2. Knee replacement surgery cost in Mexico: Mexico has become an attractive destination for medical tourism due to its lower healthcare costs and proximity to the United States. The cost of knee replacement surgery in Mexico can be significantly lower than in Europe and the United States. The prices range from 6,000 to 12,000 (USD), depending on the hospital and city. The cost difference is mainly due to lower operational expenses, wages, and the government's efforts to promote medical tourism in the country. Some well-known cities for medical care in Mexico include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Cancun, Tijuana, and Mexico City. It is vital to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before selecting a hospital in Mexico. Assess the expertise of the surgeon, the facility's success rate, and the available post-operative care and support. In summary, the cost of knee replacement surgery in Europe and Mexico shows significant variation, and both questions are inquiring about different geographical areas. Ensure you research and consider all factors such as the surgeon's expertise, hospital reputation, and aftercare support before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The questions you asked about common facial features of Israeli and Arab people are not the same, as Israeli and Arab individuals represent two distinct ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Though both may share some similarities in terms of geographical origin, their respective historical, cultural, and genetic backgrounds contribute to distinctions in appearance. It is important, however, to note that making generalized statements about the appearance of any group should be approached with caution, as variation between individuals within these groups often exceeds the differences between them. Common Facial Features of Israeli People: Israel is a diverse nation with individuals from various ethnic and religious backgrounds. The majority of Israeli Jews can trace their roots to different Jewish communities worldwide, which include Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi origins. While some phenotypic characteristics may be shared, it's essential to recognize the vast diversity within the Israeli population. 1. Ashkenazi Jews - Often originating from Central and Eastern Europe, the common features of Ashkenazi Jews may include fair skin, blue or green eyes, and light brown or blond hair. Facial features may include a more prominent nose, high cheekbones, and a round or oval-shaped face. 2. Sephardic Jews - Descending from Spain, Portugal, and North Africa, Sephardic Jews typically have darker skin tones compared to Ashkenazi Jews, with dark eyes and dark hair. Their facial features may include a larger nose, full lips, and a more angular facial structure. 3. Mizrahi Jews - Hailing from the Middle East and various Arab countries, Mizrahi Jews tend to have darker skin tones, dark eyes, and dark curly hair. Their facial features may be similar to those of neighboring Arab populations, including a prominent nose, strong eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Common Facial Features of Arab People: Arab people primarily originate from the Arab world, which stretches across Western Asia and North Africa. Like Israelis, their appearance varies significantly due to diverse ethnic, genetic, and geographical influences. 1. North African Arabs - From countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya, these individuals may exhibit a range of complexions from fair to dark skin tones. Typical facial features may include deep-set eyes, long eyelashes, a more rounded face, and a straight or aquiline nose. 2. Levantine Arabs - Originating from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine, Levantine Arabs tend to have olive or brown skin, dark eyes, and dark wavy or curly hair. Their facial features may include a prominent nose, high cheekbones, and strong jawline. 3. Gulf Arabs - From countries like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman, Gulf Arabs often have darker skin tones, dark eyes, and dark hair. Common features include a more rounded face, a prominent nose, thick eyebrows, and full lips. In conclusion, while there are some observable similarities and differences in facial features among both Israeli and Arab populations, it is crucial to remember that these groups have significant diversity within them. Ethnic backgrounds, genetic factors, and individual differences contribute to the unique appearances of people from these communities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dragon connected with the station Friday, making history as the first private capsule to reach the orbiting spacecraft. Pettit opened the hatch at 5:53 a.m. ET with Russian cosmonaut and station commander Oleg Kononenko by his side. The two men, wearing T-shirts, khaki shorts, goggles and masks gave the thumbs up to the camera after they floated inside. The initial inspection went smoothly and ahead of schedule and the interior looked good, according to SpaceX, the private company that built and operates the Dragon. Dragon reached the station Friday and was \\"captured\\" by the station's robotic arm just before 10 a.m. This groundbreaking event marked a significant milestone for the commercial space industry and was celebrated worldwide. The successful docking of the Dragon capsule to the International Space Station exemplified the capabilities of private companies, like SpaceX, in contributing to space exploration and research. The SpaceX-built capsule was carrying essential supplies for the space station, including food, water, and research materials. Over the next several days, the astronauts on the International Space Station, along with Pettit and Kononenko, carefully unpacked the contents of the Dragon capsule and transferred them to the station. This critical task demonstrated the capsule's effectiveness in delivering cargo to the orbiting laboratory, further proving its value in supporting future missions. In addition to delivering vital supplies, the Dragon capsule has been engineered to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Though this particular mission did not carry any passengers, it illustrated the potential of the capsule in transforming both manned and cargo spaceflights. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, expressed his enthusiasm for this achievement, highlighting the significance of private spacecraft in the advancement of space exploration. Following the successful completion of the mission, the Dragon capsule is scheduled to return to Earth, bringing back scientific research and equipment from the space station. This re-entry process will put the capsule's heat shield and parachutes to the test, further showcasing the durability and reliability of this groundbreaking spacecraft designed by SpaceX. In conclusion, the Dragon capsule's successful docking and delivery to the International Space Station marked a historic moment in space exploration. With private companies like SpaceX pushing the boundaries of what is possible, the future of space travel holds great promise and untapped potential. The ability to autonomously dock, combined with passenger capacity and reliable cargo transportation, signifies a major step forward in the development and growth of the commercial space industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

It is hinted that Darcy didn't have a normal family or childhood by how she constantly goes on about Rachel being the sister she never had and the mother she always wanted. Ethan is Rachel's best guy friend, who also has known Darcy since childhood. There is a history shown that for the 6th grade dance Ethan went with both Rachel and Darcy, presumably because Darcy couldn't let Rachel have a date when she didn't. He is annoyed with Darcy's treatment of Rachel. Darcy has spent years with Rachel always acquiescing to her way because of Darcy's overbearing attitude, to the point where 6 years earlier, Rachel pretty much handed her crush from law school, Dex, over to Darcy. This resulted in them getting together and now they are engaged.The Story: Rachel is about to enter a very stylish nightclub with a look of trepidation. She walks in to be greeted by a surprise party being given to her by Darcy. Of course Darcy is so into herself that even though it is Rachel's birthday, she makes the night about her, doing a picture PowerPoint of her and Rachel's friendship through the years, including 6th Grade and Ethan taking them both to the dance, although Ethan is clearly looking at Rachel, and some showy images of Darcy and Dex, who Darcy credits Rachel with them getting together. Darcy starts to dance on the stage, with an embarrassed Dex coaxing her down. Part of the way through the party, Darcy has gotten excessively drunk, so Dex is leaving with her. He points out to Rachel it was kind of her to act surprised despite him knowing she wasn't.

Knowing that Samuel could be quite intense in discussions, Joel thought it was essential to be in the right mindset before entering the room. Step 1: Breathing exercises To calm his nerves and focus his mind, Joel spent a few minutes quietly practicing deep breathing exercises. Inhaling through his nose, holding it for a few seconds, then releasing the breath slowly through his mouth. This simple practice helped Joel lower his stress levels and center his thoughts. Step 2: Recalling previous encounters Since Joel had interacted with Samuel before, he took some time to recall how those meetings went, along with the tactics that he found most successful in navigating the conversation with Samuel. By reviewing these past experiences, Joel hoped to anticipate any potential issues that might arise and be better prepared to address them. Step 3: Setting a clear agenda To ensure the meeting had structure and direction, Joel jotted down a list of topics he wanted to discuss with Samuel. By having a clear agenda, Joel knew that he would be more likely to stay focused during the meeting and less likely to be drawn into peripheral or contentious issues. Step 4: Visualize a positive outcome To counteract any negative thoughts or expectations around the visit, Joel spent a few moments visualizing the meeting going well. He pictured himself and Samuel having a constructive dialogue, finding common ground, and ultimately reaching a resolution on the matter at hand.

The box office had to contend with the World Series, a very early snowstorm in the Northeast, and Halloween festivities across the country this weekend, but audiences still managed to make it to the movies! That being said, grosses for new releases \\"Puss in Boots,\\" \\"In Time,\\" and \\"The Rum Diary,\\" weren't all that strong. Check out how they performed below:. Dreamworks Animation's \\"Puss in Boots\\" was the top cat this weekend, clawing its way to a 34 million debut, 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens, and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters. On paper, that number sounds good -- and, to be clear, it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a \\"Real Steel\\"-ish caveat. \\"Puss in Boots\\" cost 130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only \\"Flushed Away\\" and \\"Antz,\\" which started with 18.8 million and 17.2 million, respectively. The 3-D \\"Shrek\\"-spinoff, cost as much as Dreamworks' \\"Megamind,\\" which opened in early November 2010, but that film began with 46 million, and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a 148.4 million total. \\"Puss in Boots\\" entered theaters a week earlier, but it will need to endure even better than \\"Megamind\\" to earn back its budget. The \\"A-\\" CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible, but considering people are already familiar with the \\"Puss in Boots\\" character, it's doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers. We won't officially know where \\"Puss in Boots\\" is headed until next weekend, when we see how much the snowstorm, the World Series, and Halloween really affected the box office this frame. (My guess is not much -- and I'm not just being catty.) Second place belonged to \\"Paranormal Activity 3,\\" which fell by 65 percent to 18.5 million in its second weekend. The found footage horror sequel has scared up 81.3 million after ten days in theaters, and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween, \\"PA3\\" is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2's 84.8 million cume. Not too shabby for a film that cost Paramount only 5 million to make! Fall Movies: Get the latest news, photos, and more. Fox's 40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller \\"In Time\\" underwhelmed with just 12 million in its opening weekend. That debut is less than Timberlake's last film, \\"Friends with Benefits,\\" which began with 18.6 million on its way to 55.8 million, as well as Seyfried's recent \\"Red Riding Hood,\\" which debuted with 14 million on its way to 37.6 million. Ads for \\"In Time\\" failed to effectively communicate the convoluted time-shifting story, and negative reviews likely kept older moviegoers away. Timberlake's leading man status may not have helped matters too much, either -- audiences seem to find him more appealing as part of an ensemble, like in \\"The Social Network\\" and \\"Bad Teacher.\\" Moviegoers issued \\"In Time\\" an unenthusiastic \\"B-\\" CinemaScore grade, which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller \\"Source Code\\" (14.8 million opening, 54.7 million total) enjoyed earlier this year. In its third weekend, dancing remake \\"Footloose\\" fell to fourth place, dropping 48 percent to 5.4 million. The 24 million production has now earned 38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, \\"Burlesque\\" (39.4 million), sometime this week. Johnny Depp's latest, \\"The Rum Diary,\\" stumbled out of the gate with just 5 million. \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" this was not. The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp's other substance abuse picture, 1998â€²s \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" which debuted to 3.3 million and earned 10.7 million total. \\"The Rum Diary's\\" edgy story was always going to be a tough sell, and FilmDistrict's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits: \\"While we all wish the numbers were better, we're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson.\\" The 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict, the young distributor that found success with Insidious (54 million) earlier this year. The studio has since struggled with both \\"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark\\" (23.9 million) and \\"Drive\\" (33.7 million so far) recently. Unfortunately for FilmDistrict, audiences, which were 88 percent above the age of 25, gave \\"The Rum Diary\\" a harsh \\"C\\" CinemaScore grade, so it's not likely to hold well in future weeks. Talk about a bad hangover... In limited release, Sony's Shakespeare tale \\"Anonymous\\" started with 1 million out of 256 theaters. That was good enough for a 3,774 per theater average, which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks. Young romance \\"Like Crazy\\" fared better, grossing 120,000 out of only 4 theaters, resulting in a 30,000 average. Richard Gere's latest, \\"The Double,\\" was D.O.A., pulling in only 27,545 out of 11 theaters. It's not likely to platform much further. Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller \\"Margin Call\\" continued to play fairly well, grossing 713,000 out of 140 theaters. It has earned 1.5 million so far. Internationally, \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" got off to an excellent start. Sony's motion capture animation grossed 55.8 million out of 19 territories, including 21.5 million in France and 10.7 million in the United Kingdom, where its being distributed by Paramount. Sony is bragging loudly about the film's performance, perhaps in response to some prognosticators claiming that \\"Tintin\\" is likely to underperform domestically. (The picture is based on a series of comic books by HergÃ© which were very popular in Europe, but only cult hits in the U.S.) We'll find out how excited audiences are about \\"Tintin\\" on December 21. 1. \\"Puss in Boots\\" -- 34 million. 2. \\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" -- 18.5 mil. 3. \\"In Time\\" -- 12 mil. 4. \\"Footloose\\" -- 5.4 mil. 5. \\"The Rum Diary\\" -- 5 mil. 6. \\"Real Steel\\" -- 4.7 mil. 7. \\"The Three Musketeers\\" -- 3.5 mil. 8. \\"The Ides of March\\" -- 2.7 mil. 9. \\"Moneyball\\" -- 2.4 mil. 10. \\"Courageous\\" -- 1.8 mil.

Answer:","completion":"The Yangtze River Delta is a vast region in Eastern China that consists of the alluvial plain created by the confluence of the Yangtze River and East China Sea, covering an area of around 135,000 square kilometers. It is one of the most densely populated and industrialized zones in China, with significant economic influence both on the national and global scale. Both Xinji and Shanghai are located in Eastern China, but when comparing their locations in relation to the Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai is undoubtedly the city that is situated within this geographical area. Shanghai, being one of the four direct-controlled municipalities in China, is located in the eastern part of the Yangtze River Delta. It serves as a significant economic, financial, and logistics hub, contributing to a large part of the delta's prosperity. Moreover, the city of Shanghai holds strategic importance due to its location near the mouth of the Yangtze River, allowing easy access to the East China Sea and facilitating trade and transport. On the other hand, Xinji is a county-level city under the administration of Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province. While Xinji is in Eastern China, it is positioned further north compared to the Yangtze River Delta and not within its boundaries. Xinji is known for its leather industry and does not share the same level of economic influence as the cities within the Yangtze River Delta. In conclusion, of the two cities in question, Shanghai is the one located in the Yangtze River Delta, boasting a dynamic economy and highly developed infrastructure that greatly contribute to the importance and growth of this region in Eastern China. Xinji, despite being in the same general geographic area, is not situated within the boundaries of the Yangtze River Delta."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them.

It’s helpful to remember that the Tea Party crew’s main demand is an end to Obamacare, a health care reform law that was passed years ago. Putting it another way, the Republicans, currently led by the Tea Party, are willing to risk a US default in order to keep working class Americans from accessing affordable health care.

Firstly, the reviewer points out that even though the main workout area is satisfactory, the bathroom and locker room areas are described as \\"filthy\\" and \\"nasty.\\" Such harsh language indicates dissatisfaction with the cleanliness of these spaces. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that the situation appears to be deteriorating, which implies that the gym management is not taking appropriate action to rectify the issue. Secondly, the reviewer expresses frustration with the gym staff, specifically with their unresponsive and indifferent behavior. When the reviewer asks to see a manager, they mention that the staff members claim to be managers but seem not to care about the concerns being raised. This demonstrates a lack of professionalism and attentiveness from the gym's management, which plays a significant role in shaping a customer's overall experience. The negative tone of the review stems from the dissatisfaction with the cleanliness of crucial areas within the facility and the unhelpful attitude of the gym staff.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang? , can you please find it? ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress. Answer:","completion":"The first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang is Harry.

Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers. They believe intelligent life exists somewhere in the universe. They also think we will soon contact these beings. Why do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets? The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \\"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\\" say Shostak and Barnet. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \\"Tools like the Hubble telescope have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\\" says Shostak. \\"And our galaxy, the Milk Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\\" In the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life. Have beings from space already visited Earth? \\"Probably not,\\" says Shostak. \\"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signs.

Answer:","completion":"[d]. is untying shoelaces from a brown high shoe, then brushes it with a large brush, then he takes a smaller brush, dips it into a small container, then brushes it onto the shoe and the shoe looks very polished on any surface that he brushes. As the man in the green apron continues his demonstration, the audience watches in awe at the significant transformation of the once-worn brown shoe. He explains that the smaller brush, with its compact and dense bristles, is designed to penetrate deeply into the fibers of the shoe material, effectively removing dirt, dust, and debris that can accumulate over time. This, he adds, plays a key role in maintaining the shoe's longevity and preserving its appearance. Next, the man moves on to the cloth, which he claims is made from a unique blend of microfiber materials explicitly designed for cleaning and polishing shoes. He emphasizes that the cloth is machine-washable and highly durable, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution to keeping shoes looking their best. As the presentation progresses, the man picks up the shoe shaper and explains its purpose in maintaining the shape and structure of shoes, particularly when they're not in use. He highlights the importance of using shoe shapers to prevent the formation of creases, which can be detrimental to the shoe's overall aesthetic. Then, the man takes a moment to discuss the significance of shoelaces in the overall package, as many people often overlook their contribution to the shoe's appearance. He demonstrates the correct way to lace up the polished shoe, ensuring that it fits snugly yet comfortably. He advocates for the occasional replacement of shoelaces when they become worn or frayed, as this can significantly impact the look and feel of the shoe. As he approaches the end of his presentation, the man turns his attention to the small tin containers- one of which contains a high-quality shoe polish, while the other contains a waterproofing agent. He stresses the importance of using suitable products for specific types of shoes, as the improper application of polishes or weatherproofing solutions can cause permanent damage. Finally, in wrapping up his demonstration, the man in the green apron reiterates the importance of proper shoe care and maintenance. He encourages his audience to invest in quality shoe care products and to take the time to look after their shoes. By doing so, not only will they be enhancing the visual appeal of their footwear, but they'll also be prolonging the life of their prized possessions, ensuring that they continue to exude style and sophistication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detention is a temporary disciplinary measure within a school setting and does not influence long-term educational decisions. Similarly, labeling someone as \\"stupid\\" is a reductive and unhelpful way to discuss the complexities of a person's educational choices. Step 2: Compare remaining options Now, we are left with three options: \\"overwhelmed,\\" \\"dropping out,\\" and \\"much work.\\" Step 3: Assess each option \\"Overwhelmed\\" can be a reason for graduates to not attend school later in life; however, it is a vague term that could encompass many feelings or situations. It is not as specific as the other remaining options. \\"Dropping out\\" could be a reason for not continuing education; however, this term is more applicable to individuals who leave school before completing their degree. Since the question is about graduates, who have already completed a degree, \\"dropping out\\" is less relevant. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate option Finally, \\"much work\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. Many graduates find themselves with increased professional and personal responsibilities after completing their education. They may have a demanding job, start a family, or care for aging relatives. All of these factors can contribute to the decision not to attend school later in life, as they might not have the time or resources to dedicate to further education. In conclusion, I believe that \\"much work\\" is the most fitting choice to explain why some graduates might choose not to attend school later in life, as it accurately reflects the real-life challenges and responsibilities they may face."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ancient Warming Gives Ominous Peek at Climate Change New data from the Earth's last big warmup, some 56 million years ago, may offer a sneak peek into what today's climate change may eventually look like. Scientists have determined that the rate at which carbon emissions heated up the planet during the late Paleocene is much more similar to modern human-caused warming than many experts previously thought, a new report published Monday in Nature Geoscience shows. The good news, the researchers say, is that most of the species around at the time survived the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM, although many had to migrate. The bad news: It took nearly 200,000 years for the Earth to recover from that warming, in which temperatures rose by 9 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 8 Celsius). And the scientists found evidence of two carbon releases, with a bigger one following the first, a possible sign of a triggering mechanism. \\"If you're looking for an ancient analogue to what is happening now to see how bad it's likely to be, this is the whole thing,\\" said Richard Norris, a professor of paleobiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who is unaffiliated with the new report. \\"You can see how the event played out. So, in that respect, showing that this ancient event occurred rapidly is an important finding.\\" To look at the historical climate, University of Utah researchers drilled down more than 1,200 feet in Wyoming's Big Horn Basin and extracted cylindrical sections of rock called core samples. \\"We are looking at a basin in Wyoming that is next to Yellowstone,\\" said the study's lead author, Gabriel Bowen, an associate professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah. \\"It's an outstanding place to look at this period of geologic history because the mountains were actively rising and they formed a bowl into which all rock material from weathering in the mountains flowed. There was a rapid accumulation of sediment being deposited in episodic floods. And during quiet periods soil formed. Those soils are what we are studying.\\" The rate at which carbon was being released leading up to the PETM was pretty close to the rate being released now, which is 20.9 trillion pounds (9.5 petagrams) per year, the researchers found. \\"We are doing some crazy things with the carbon cycle,\\" Bowen says. \\"Carbon naturally moves back and forth between rocks and the atmosphere at a steady slow rate. What we are doing by burning fossil fuels is accelerating the pace by about 30 times over the natural rate.\\" The effects during the PETM weren't limited to temperature. \\"There were big changes in the water cycle,\\" Bowen says. \\"For some regions there were really severe extreme precipitation events, and in some, like Wyoming, there was aridification.\\" University of Utah geochemist Gabriel Bowen works on Wyoming sediment cores at a lab in Germany for a study that showed today’s global warming is more similar than had been thought to a climate change episode almost 56 million years ago. Intriguingly, Bowen and his colleagues determined that there were actually two releases of carbon into the atmosphere, one before the PETM and one shortly after it started. And that may be a sign of scary things to come. \\"One possible explanation is that the first, the smaller one, caused some climate change that triggered a second one,\\" Bowen said. \\"So it's possible that the current pulse we are adding to the atmosphere may trigger unanticipated feedbacks that might lead to warming that could last hundreds of thousands of years.\\" That first release of carbon could have been the result of volcanism, Bowen says. And that might have caused the oceans to warm, which could have led to the melting of methane that lies in frozen deposits on the sea floor. And that could have accounted for the second pulse. \\"We don't need a ton of warming for that to happen,\\" Bowen said. \\"That's a little scary.\\" The methane melting scenario makes a lot of sense, says Baerbel Hoenisch, an expert in paleoclimatology and an associate professor of earth and environmental science at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \\"If the frozen methane gas gets released it won't leave a trace,\\" said Hoenisch, who is unaffiliated with the new study. \\"Like ice that melts, it's just not there anymore. That's why we can't say with all certainty what the cause of the event was. But it's quite cool that they found the two peaks.\\" Although there weren't a lot of extinctions of land animals, about 50 percent of the foraminifera became extinct during the PETM. \\"Most people won't care about foraminifera,\\" Hoenisch said. \\"They are single cell organisms that are at the bottom of the ocean's food chain. But if you take those away, there are repercussions at the higher levels of the ecosystem.\\" Another problem that developed during the PETM was acidification of the oceans, Norris said. The result: coral reefs died off. \\"They disappeared for about 10 million years and they didn't come back until the planet began to cool,\\" Norris added. \\"Coral reefs are already having trouble now. So that's a sobering thought. We may not have reefs around the planet much longer.\\" One big difference between then and now: There weren't a lot of species around that needed a cold climate, Norris said. So, tropical animals and plants could just relocate to northern climates. Now, we have polar bears, whales, penguins and other species that live in the Arctic and Antarctic. \\"Those ecosystems are being profoundly affected by what is happening now,\\" Norris said.

The Red State in Your Future Voters around the country are concluding it’s better to be red than dead—applying a whole meaning to an old phrase. If you do not currently live in a red state, there’s a good chance you will be in the near future. Either you will flee to a red state or a red state will come to you—because voters fed up with blue-state fiscal irresponsibility will elect candidates who promise to pass red-state policies. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 25 state legislatures are controlled by Republicans and 16 by Democrats, with eight split (i.e., each party controlling one house). There are 29 Republican governors and 20 Democrats, with one independent. And there are 20 states where Republicans control both the legislature and governor’s mansion vs. 11 Democratic, with 18 split (one party controls the governor’s office and the other the legislature). And though we are a year away from the 2012 election, generic Republican vs. Democratic polls have given Republicans the edge for more than a year. If that pattern holds—and if blue-state leaders refuse to learn from their policy mistakes, just like their true-blue leader in the White House—it likely means there will be even more red states in 2013. One reason for that shift is that red states are taking fiscal responsibility while many blue states aren’t—and it shows. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a bipartisan association of conservative state legislators, recently released its fourth edition of “Rich States, Poor States,” by the well-known Reagan economist Arthur B. Laffer, the Wall Street Journal’s Steve Moore, and Jonathan Williams of ALEC. The study looks at factors that affect state prosperity and economic outlook, such as tax burdens and population change. What’s clear is that red or red-leaning states dominate the top positions while blue states have the dubious distinction of dragging in last. In the economic outlook section, for example, the top 20 states are bright red or lean red, while eight out of the bottom 10 are very blue: New York, Vermont, California, Hawaii, New Jersey, Illinois, Oregon and Rhode Island. Most of the “poor states” states, as ALEC calls them, have the highest personal income tax rates and the largest unfunded state pension liabilities. But instead of taking the red-state approach by lowering taxes and/or cutting spending, the blue states tend to want to raise taxes even higher, just like their White House mentor. The result of their overpromising and overspending, and their knee-jerk response to solving their fiscal problems by raising taxes, is that people are increasingly fleeing the blue states. As commentator Michael Medved points out: “Between 2009 and 2010 the five biggest losers in terms of ‘residents lost to other states’ were all prominent redoubts of progressivism: California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey. Meanwhile, the five biggest winners in the relocation sweepstakes are all commonly identified as red states in which Republicans generally dominate local politics: Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia.” The good news is that some blue states [at least five in the nearby map] have seen the light and are turning red, embracing the limited government/low taxes red-state vision and are coming back from the brink. Maine, for example, is one of ALEC’s bottom 10 states. But as of the last election, Maine now has a Republican state house and governor. And the new governor has been pushing for the red-state approach, cutting both taxes and state spending. The Washington Times recently pointed out that “at least a dozen [mostly red] states ended fiscal 2011 with surpluses.” Maine was one of them. And Maine is not alone. Blue-leaning Michigan and Wisconsin both have elected Republican legislatures and governors, as has swing-state Pennsylvania. And blue Minnesota now has a Republican legislature. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The current political landscape of the United States, with a majority of Republican-controlled state legislatures and governor positions, suggests an overall trend towards red-state policies. 2. The reasons behind the shift towards red states are primarily due to their fiscal responsibility compared to blue states. Red or red-leaning states are dominating in terms of economic outlook, while blue states tend to have higher tax burdens and unfunded state pension liabilities. 3. The overpromising, overspending, and tax-raising tendencies of blue states have led to an increasing number of residents fleeing those states for red ones. California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey have seen significant losses in population, while Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia have seen gains. 4. Some previously blue states, like Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, have recently shifted towards red-state policies by electing Republican legislatures and governors. These states have adopted a red-state approach by cutting taxes and state spending, which has resulted in improvements in their economic outlook and fiscal surpluses. Overall, the text argues that the increasing popularity and success of red-state policies in the United States is a potential indicator of a continuing trend towards more states embracing fiscally conservative, Republican-leaning policies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show. In 1980, Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. Many of \\"SNL\\"s cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind the camera.

By Pa Reporter Holland coach Guus Hiddink let rip at his players following their last-gasp 2-1 defeat to Czech Republic in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. An awful defensive mistake from Newcastle's Daryl Janmaat gifted Vaclav Pilar an injury-time winner in Hiddink's first competitive match in charge. Janmaat headed Borek Dockal's cross against his own post and could only look on in horror as Pilar anticipated the rebound to convert from a couple of yards. Livid: Gus Hiddink was left fuming after Holland lost to Czech Republic in their oprning Euro 2016 qualifier Howler: Newcastle defender Daryl Janmaat's error led to a last minute winner from the Czech Republic","completion":"Following the match, Hiddink did not hesitate to criticize his team's performance, especially focusing on the unfortunate error from Newcastle's Daryl Janmaat in the closing moments of the game. He lambasted his team, saying that their performance was not up to the high standards set by the team and the nation. Hiddink, who had been hired with the expectation of leading the Dutch team into a successful Euro 2016 tournament, found himself grappling with an unexpected setback in their opening match. The defeat to Czech Republic was a major disappointment, and Hiddink pinned much of it on the defender's critical mistake. The Holland coach stated, \\"We had anticipated the opposition's strategy and yet we fall prey to such a simple mistake? This defeat was a result of poor judgment and lack of concentration, particularly during the final stages of the match when every decision counts.\\" Daryl Janmaat, who was at the center of the criticism, had made a terrible defensive mistake that gave Vaclav Pilar of Czech Republic an opportunity to score the match-winning goal during injury time. Janmaat's attempt to head a cross from Borek Dockal had ended up hitting his own post, setting up Pilar for an easy finish from close range. As the ball found the back of the net, Janmaat could only stare in disbelief and frustration. The bitter reality of the significant mistake that cost them the match was too stark, and it was clear that Janmaat was devastated. His mistake, essentially gifting the win to the Czech Republic, was an agonizing sight for all Dutch supporters to witness. In his post-match press conference, Hiddink said his message to the team was clear: \\"We have lost, but we must learn from our mistakes. We must not let this define our tournament. We must bounce back, review what went wrong and ensure it doesn't happen again.\\" This unexpected loss, however, wasn't merely a result of Janmaat’s costly error. It pointed to wider issues that Hiddink and his staff needed to address. The entire team's performance was lackluster, with poor decision making, lack of creativity, and a bothersome lack of urgency in the offensive half. Hiddink knows that going forward, his side will need to show more coherence in their game plan and be more clinical in execution if they wish to bounce back from this early setback and make a deep run in Euro 2016. His task now is not only to rectify the mistakes but also rejuvenate a beaten team and restore the confidence that seemed to have taken a big hit. As the team and its coach prepare for the upcoming matches, it would be interesting to see how they respond to this loss. The Euro 2016 campaign may have started on a wrong footing for the Dutch, but with experienced guidance like Hiddink's, they still have the potential to turn things around. They just now need to translate that potential into results, starting from their very next fixture."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: M: Well, to tell the truth, I'm so busy with my work.

Answer the question: If Jim increases the amount of field lines drawn what will happen to the strength of the field decrease or increase? A:","completion":"If Jim increases the amount of field lines drawn, the strength of the field will increase. This is based on the fact that field lines are used to visually represent the strength and direction of a field, be it an electric field, magnetic field, or gravitational field. By drawing more field lines, it indicates that the field's influence is more significant in the region defined by those lines. The concept of field lines helps us understand the underlying forces in a field. For example, in the case of a magnetic field, the field lines are used to depict the direction and strength of the magnetic force that exists around a magnet or within a magnetic system. They originate from the north pole of the magnet and curve back towards the south pole before returning to the north pole within the magnet. Similarly, electric field lines depict the force acting on charged particles by originating from positive charges and terminating at negative charges. The density and number of field lines are directly related to the field's strength. When field lines are drawn closer together, it signifies a stronger field because there is a more substantial force acting in that region. Conversely, when field lines are more spread out, the field is weaker. This relationship between field lines and field strength helps scientists, engineers, and even students to understand and visualize fields more effectively. So, when Jim increases the amount of field lines drawn within a specific area, it implies that the field becomes more robust and has more influence over that region. As a result, the strength of the field will increase. However, it is essential to understand that drawing the field lines is a means of visualizing and representing the field strength, and it is the underlying forces and interactions within the field that determine its actual strength. Simply adding more lines on a piece of paper would not change a field's physical properties; it would only be a representation of an increased field strength."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Allen Toussaint (; January 14, 1938 - November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular music's great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet. Allen Toussaint learned piano as a child and took informal music lessons from an elderly neighbor, Ernest Pinn. In his teens he played in a band, the Flamingos, with the guitarist Snooks Eaglin, before dropping out of school. A significant early influence on Toussaint was the syncopated \\"second-line\\" piano style of Professor Longhair. After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey \\"Piano\\" Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino's record \\"I Want You to Know\\", on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer also came in 1957 with Lee Allen's \\"Walking with Mr. Lee\\". He began performing regularly in Bartholomew's band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers. After being spotted as a sideman by the A&R man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, The Wild Sound of New Orleans, with a band including Alvin \\"Red\\" Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles \\"Hungry\\" Williams (drums). The recordings included Toussaint and Tyler's composition \\"Java\\", which first charted for Floyd Cramer in 1962 and became a number 4 pop hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive?, using the article: After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus. Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.

The long strait divides the island of Karmøy on the west and the mainland of Norway and island of Vestre Bokn in the east. The strait runs through the municipalities of Haugesund, Karmøy, and Bokn. The town of Haugesund lies at the northern end of the strait and the town of Kopervik lies in the central part of the strait, and the village of Skudeneshavn lies near the southern end where the strait flows into the Boknafjorden. The Karmsund Bridge, a part of the European route E134 highway, links Karmøy to the mainland. The bridge was completed in 1955. The small islands of Vibrandsøy, Risøy, and Hasseløy lie in the strait at the northern end, just off shore from the town of Haugesund. - Avaldsnes is a village in Karmøy municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located on the northeastern part of the island of Karmøy, along the Karmsundet strait, just south of the town of Haugesund. The village was an ancient centre of power on the west coast of Norway and is the site of one of Norways more important areas of cultural history. The trading port of Notow and the Avaldsnes Church are two notable historic sites in Avaldsnes. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - Location. The town is situated on a strategically important sound, the Karmsundet, through which ships could pass without traversing heavy seas. In the early years, the coastal waters off Haugesund were a huge source of herring, and the town grew accordingly. Despite being barely a village back then, King Harald Fairhair lived at Avaldsnes, very close to the modern town of Haugesund. In the last decades, the town, like its neighbours, has been turning towards the petroleum industry, with the herring being long gone. - Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Hárfagri\\", Norwegian: \\"Harald Hårfagre\\", (literally \\"Harald Hair-fair\\") ; 850 932) is remembered by medieval historians as the first King of Norway. According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from 872 to 930. Most of his life remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. A few remnants of skaldic praise poems attributed to contemporary court poets exist which seem to refer to Harald's victories against opponents in Norway. The information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death. - Fotballklubben Haugesund is a Norwegian football club from the city of Haugesund .

Updated Saturday 9am * Libyan plane hijacked during internal flight * Two hijackers on board claimed to have hand grenade * Passengers started disembarking at 1.50pm * Hijackers seen leaving plane at 3.40pm * Passengers leave Malta early this morning All hostages have been released following a hijack drama at Malta International Airport. At 3.20pm, the hijackers were seen leaving the plane and surrendering to soldiers following an almost four-hour standoff. The Afriqiyah Airways A320 with around 120 people on board landed in Malta after it was hijacked in Libyan airspace. The plane was on an internal flight from Sebha to Tripoli when it was diverted by two hijackers, believed to be in their mid 20s, who threatened to blow up the plane. They were later found to have used fake weapons. A total of 111 passengers - 82 men, 28 women and an infant - and six crew members were on board the aircraft which landed in Malta at 11.32am. All passengers are believed to be Libyan. The updates were provided by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat who posted tweets about the ongoing drama. Video: Steve Zammit Lupi A Libyan security official told Reuters that the pilot told Tripoli Airport Control before communications were lost that the pilot tried to land in Libya but the hijackers refused. A statement from Afriqiyah Airways this evening said the hijackers refused the proposal from the pilot to land the aircraft in Tripoli and negotiate there. Subsequently a decision was taken to land the aircraft in Malta because of fuel limitations. Soldiers and emergency services surrounded the aircraft as soon as it landed in Malta. First group of passengers, consisting of women and children, being released now. — Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) December 23, 2016 The hijackers, later named as Suhaha Mussa and Ahmed Alid, claiming to be from a pro-Gaddafi group, had said they were willing to let all passengers go apart from the crew, if their demands were met. It is still not known what were their demands though as the drama unfolded it appeared to be result of the bitter Libyan political feud rather than an act of terrorism. One German report said they were demanding the release of Saif Gaddafi. TV footage showed the suspected hijacker carrying the green flag outside the plane. The claim was reinforced at 2.50pm when one of the hijackers was seen at the aircraft door waving the former green Libya flag. Reuters reported that the hijacker had told Libyan TV he is the head of the \\"pro-Gaddafi party\\". But a Libyan minister was later quoted as saying that the two hijackers were seeking political asylum in Malta, a claim later rejected by Dr Muscat. A gangway was seen being taken towards the plane at 1.45pm and an aircraft door was opened disembarking women and children first. The first coachload of people was taken towards Lufthansa Technik before the rest of the passengers followed shortly after. The disembarkation happened calmly, including the moments when the hijackers were seen leaving the aircraft, one of them holding the former green Libya flag. Screenshot: FlightRadar 24 The head of communications at the Prime Minister's office, Kurt Farrugia, tweeted at 1.15pm that Dr Muscat had spoken to Libyan Prime Minister Faez al Serraj. International media reported that the Libyan transport minister was at one point negotiating with the hijackers. From the Maltese side, AFM commander Jeffrey Curmi was put at the head of negotiations. While thanking all those involved in the operation, the Nationalist Opposition said every effort should be made to avoid a repetition of a similar incident. The passengers on board the flight departed Malta early this morning on another aircraft leased by the same airline.

At 12.43pm, the airport informed passengers airport operations had resumed. At 1.15pm passengers were informed that all flights were delayed and flights that had been diverted to Sicily started returning to Malta. At 12.30pm, nine flights had already been diverted to Catania. Hundreds of passengers are believed to be waiting at the airport departures lounge in Malta as well as in airports in Sicily. Afriqiyah Airways operates from Sebha to Tripoli on Friday, leaving at 10.10am and arriving at 11.20am. It operates another flight on Tuesdays. This evening, MIA said that airport operations will fully recover by the end of this evening. By 6pm, a total of three outgoing flights remain delayed and as a reaction to the disruption this afternoon, seven incoming flights are expected later on this evening. The aerodrome was closed for under 30 minutes with a total of 44 flights affected. Nine incoming flights which were diverted, while delays were registered across 20 departing flights and 15 arrivals. \\"Malta International Airport would also like to express its satisfaction at the emergency response teams’ reaction to today’s unfortunate events. Our topmost priority was to maintain our safety and security standards across the airport campus, and safeguard our passengers and colleagues at all times.\\" First major hijack in Malta since 1985 The last major hijack incident in Malta took place in November 23, 1985 when an EgyptAir Boeing 737 plane was diverted to the island. What followed was a 24-hour nightmare that ended in a bloody massacre with 62 people dead when Egyptian commandos stormed the plane. Only one of the three hijackers survived and was brought to justice. Forty-three years ago then Prime Minster Dom Mintoff managed to negotiate the release of 247 passengers and eight air hostesses on board a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet which was also hijacked over Iraq and flown to Malta. The passengers and air hostesses were released in return for fuel. The plane had been hijacked by Palestinian terrorists. The plane later left Malta and the hijackers eventually surrendered. ||||| VALLETTA (Reuters) - Hijackers armed with what were probably replica weapons forced an airliner to land in Malta on Friday before freeing all their hostages unharmed and surrendering, having declared loyalty to Libya’s late leader Muammar Gaddafi. Television pictures showed two men being led from the aircraft in handcuffs. The prime minister of the tiny Mediterranean island, Joseph Muscat, tweeted: “Hijackers surrendered, searched and taken in custody”. The Airbus A320 had been on an internal flight in Libya on Friday morning when it was diverted to Malta, 500 km (300 miles) north of the Libyan coast, after a man told the crew he had a hand grenade. Muscat said the grenade and two pistols the hijackers were also carrying appeared to be replicas, according to an initial forensic examination. A Libyan television channel reported it had spoken by phone with a hijacker who described himself as head of a pro-Gaddafi party. Gaddafi was killed in an uprising in 2011, and Libya has been racked by factional violence since. With troops positioned a few hundred meters (yards) away, buses were driven onto the tarmac at Malta International Airport to carry away 109 passengers, as well as some of the crew. Television footage showed no signs of struggle or alarm. After the passengers had left the plane, a man briefly appeared at the top of the steps with a plain green flag resembling that of Gaddafi’s now-defunct state. Libya’s Channel TV station said one hijacker, who gave his name as Moussa Shaha, had said by phone he was the head of Al-Fateh Al-Jadid, or The New Al-Fateh. Al-Fateh is the name that Gaddafi gave to September, the month he staged a coup in 1969, and the word came to signify his coming to power. Two hijackers of a Libyan Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A320 surrender to Maltese military on the runway at Malta Airport, December 23, 2016. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit-Lupi In a tweet, the TV station later quoted the hijacker as saying: “We took this measure to declare and promote our new party.” STANDOFF ON TARMAC Lawmaker Hadi al-Saghir told Reuters that Abdusalem Mrabit, a fellow member of Libya’s House of Representatives on the plane, had told him the two hijackers were in their mid-20s and were from the Tebu ethnic group in southern Libya. After the standoff ended peacefully, Muscat told a news conference there had been talks between Maltese authorities and the Libyan hijackers. The men had asked for two Maltese negotiators to board the aircraft, but this was rejected. “We were not willing to negotiate until there was a surrender,” he said, adding that the hijackers had not requested asylum. A senior Libyan security official told Reuters the first news of the hijack came in a call from the pilot to the control tower at Tripoli’s Mitiga airport. “Then they lost communication with him,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The pilot tried very hard to have them land at the correct destination but they refused.” Slideshow (22 Images) The aircraft, operated by state-owned Afriqiyah Airways, had been flying from Sebha in southwest Libya to Tripoli, a trip that would usually take a little over two hours. The last major hijacking on Malta was in 1985, when Palestinians took over an Egyptair plane. Egyptian commandos stormed the aircraft and dozens of people were killed. ||||| On Nov. 23, 1985 Egyptair Flight 648, bound from Athens to Cairo, was hijacked and forced to land in Malta. While negotiating their demands, the hijackers-members of a dissident Palestinian faction calling itself Egypt’s Revolution—brutally demonstrated their seriousness. They marched five American and Israeli passengers to the front of the plane, shot them each in the head and shoved them down the steps of the boarding ramp. The drama ended after nearly 24 hours when Egyptian commandos stormed the plane; two hijackers and 57 of 92 passengers were killed during the rescue attempt. The hijacking was one of the bloodiest on record, but there was a trio of miracles. Three of the passengers who had been shot in the head lived: Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman who was nicked in the ear and Patrick Scott Baker, 29, from White Salmon, Wash., who was only grazed by the hijacker’s bullet and has completely recovered. Not so lucky was Jackie Nink Pflug, 31, a special education teacher, who survived her head wound and surgery but is still troubled by seizures, vision problems and traumatic memories. She discussed her ordeal with correspondent Civia Tamarkin. I am not a hero. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I was lucky survived. I was shot in the head for no other reason than that I am an American, and I’ll live with the results the rest of my life. I didn’t give much thought to the possibility of being hijacked when my husband, Scott, and I left to teach in Cairo in August 1985, only two days after we were married. Hijackings, you always think, happen to other people. We loved living in Cairo. I had a position working with learning-disabled children at the Cairo American School, and Scott taught physical education and coached the girls’ varsity volleyball team there. I felt alive and happy, and then suddenly, without choice, everything in my life changed. In November Scott took his team to play a tournament in Athens. I went along for the fun of a two-day holiday and the chance to shop for all the things I couldn’t find in Cairo. Because I had to get back to teach earlier than Scott did, I booked a reservation on a late Saturday evening flight. When I walked into the airport that night I felt strange, eerie. Security was lax. They were hand checking everything, but not very thoroughly. The guard only shook one or two of the bags stuffed with groceries inside my duffel and then waved me on. I remember thinking that I could have a gun in there and no one would know. On the plane I had an aisle seat in the third row. As people got settled I turned around to see who was on the plane. I noticed the man sitting catty-corner behind me. He was good looking, with short hair and pretty eyes. I guessed he was Egyptian or Palestinian. But he was nervous and fidgeting, and I wondered what his problem was. About 15 minutes after we took off, I was listening on my Walkman to Born in the U.S.A. when I heard a commotion. There was the nervous man standing in the aisle behind me. He had two grenades in his left hand and a gun in his right. He was yelling in English to people, telling them to sit down and shut up. I thought it had to be a bad dream. He was trying to pull the pins out of the grenades with his teeth. “I’ve got to get out of here, I’ve got to get out of here,” I kept thinking, but there was no way out. I put my head in my hands, but as soon as I lifted my face I felt a gun poking me in the back of my head. The hijacker said, “Are you scared, lady?” I said, “No, I’m fine,” and I thought, “Jackie, how could you say that?” The stewardess got on the speaker and said we were being hijacked by members of a group called Egypt’s Revolution. All of us in the front of the plane were told to go to the back and fill up empty seats. I ended up in the last row, next to a hijacker. Meanwhile another one in the front—I think there were four altogether—was collecting passports. Suddenly there were shots. One of the Egyptian sky marshals on board pulled out a gun and shot one of the hijackers. Then the hijacker next to me shot the marshal. Up in the air the shooting sounded like firecrackers. Everyone was in shock. Just as it was my turn to hand in my passport, the plane made a very rough landing at Malta. On the way up the aisle to get my passport, which I had left in my original seat, I stepped over a body. I couldn’t believe I was doing that. I was ushered to the middle of the plane and put in a seat next to Scarlett Rogenkamp, who was a 38-year-old American woman from Oceanside, Calif. Then the hijackers asked if there were any Israelis on board. One woman stood up and walked to the front of the plane. We heard gunshots. Then the hijackers identified another Israeli woman from her passport. We heard another shot and a thump, thump, thump and then a thud. It was a body hitting the stairs and then the tarmac. I knew Scarlett and I were next because we were Americans. Sure enough they came for us and took us to the front row with another American, Patrick Scott Baker. They tied our hands behind our backs with neckties and sat us down. Five or 10 minutes later they came for Patrick Baker. They shot him, and we heard the same thumping sound. Scarlett was next. They shot her in the head and threw her off. She died immediately. Then they came to get me. I walked up to the door without crying or doing anything. They opened the door and I could see bright light. There was a loud and heavy feeling in my head, and I heard something tumbling. But I didn’t feel myself hitting anything. It was more like floating. I thought I had better play dead ’cause I didn’t know where the hijackers were. I didn’t feel any pain. It started to rain, and I could feel the cold rain seeping into my head. Later I was told that the bullet was lodged in the back of my skull like a cork. The bullet was fired point-blank, but miraculously it didn’t go all the way in. I was left lying on the tarmac for over five hours. I drifted in and out of sleep. I thought, “If I live, I probably won’t be normal.” The rain stopped, I saw a really pretty blue sky and puffy white clouds, and I thought, “What a pretty day to have such terrible things happening.” I heard a vehicle approaching. People got out, and I could only see pants legs. I didn’t know whether it was the hijackers, so I closed my eyes and continued to play dead. A voice on the megaphone said, “Okay, you can pick her up now.” They dragged me across the tarmac and threw me face-down on a metal bed. They put me inside some vehicle, and we began moving when one of the medics turned me over. I was startled so I gasped. They screamed, “She’s alive!” And they raced to the hospital. They had been on their way to the morgue. At St. Luke’s Hospital in Valletta, Malta, doctors took the bullet out of my skull. Bone had been shattered, and I now have a dent in my head. In the process of picking out the fragments, they removed some tissue and damaged the part of the brain that controls the left peripheral vision in both eyes. Recuperating at a U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, West Germany, I began to realize something was wrong. When I got out of bed, I thought my feet were touching the floor, but they weren’t. When I reached for the wall, it wasn’t there. Both my depth perception and my balance were very bad. I also had a muffled ringing in my ears because of a concussion to the middle ear. The doctors left me with no hope about my depth perception returning. Still, I felt like I was a walking miracle. If the bullet had moved a half inch either way, I could have been paralyzed. The doctors did warn me that there was always a chance I might have seizures. I also saw a psychiatrist who explained I might have post-traumatic stress syndrome, similar to war veterans. I was happy to be alive, but at the same time I felt angry and bitter. Why did this have to happen to me? When we returned to the U.S. we went to live with Scott’s parents near Minneapolis. The worst problem was my vision. I’d look at something and it wasn’t whole. If I looked at a person, the eyes would be in one place and the nose in another. One day my mother-in-law took me shopping for some things to wear because everything I had was left behind in Egypt or lost on the jet. I tried on a pair of pants, but I couldn’t tell what they looked like. I came home and started crying. A month later we moved into our own apartment. I was starting to get some of my health back. But my analytical and critical thinking skills had left me. I didn’t know what anything meant. I’d look at a watch, and it would say 8 o’clock, and I didn’t know what 8 o’clock meant. It is still very difficult for me to read and decode words because letters are on top of letters and pieces of letters are missing, and I only see halves of words. With my visual problems, if I make a letter bigger there are even more pieces. But if I shrink it, I can see it better. I suddenly realized what I had been dealing with for so many years as a special education teacher. Now the tables were turned, and I was a learning-disabled student. There was a lot of self-pity, too. I had torn ligaments in my neck from the fall onto the tarmac. I had severe headaches and I developed seizures. To add to it all, the medication for controlling the seizures made me depressed. I had significant mood swings from very high to very low. I had grown up with this attitude that it’s not okay to cry. Yet I could feel all this emotion bottled up and bubbling inside me. Finally last spring I went to a therapist. Talking to her I was able to let it all out and break down and cry. It felt good. On top of everything else, we also have a problem paying medical bills. President Reagan told me I shouldn’t have to pay these expenses, and he assigned an aide to help us straighten things out. But somehow because of the bureaucracy, we are still stuck with many of these costs. Now it’s a year after the hijacking, and my vision and hearing are still impaired. I still have memory loss and suffer from seizures. But right now the way I measure my success is by not getting upset if I fail at something. I try to tackle it again without quitting. The anger and bitterness are gone. I am determined to make it back to the way I was before. But then I wonder—what’s going to happen up the road? What am I going to be like three months from now? ||||| Summary:","completion":"A Libyan Afriqiyah Airways A320 plane with around 120 passengers on board was hijacked during an internal flight by two hijackers in their mid-20s.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years.

Q:Information: - A prefectural-level municipality, prefectural-level city or prefectural city is an administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China's administrative structure. Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities. - In many countries, a mayor (or , from the Latin \\"maior\\" , meaning \\"bigger\\") is the highest-ranking official in a municipal government such as that of a city or a town. - Gansu (Xiao'erjing: \\"Gansw\\") is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the northwest of the country. - Ningxia (pronounced , Xiao'erjing: ), officially the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China located in the northwest part of the country. Formerly a province, Ningxia was incorporated into Gansu in 1954 but was separated from Gansu in 1958 and was reconstituted as an autonomous region for the Hui people, one of the 56 officially recognised nationalities of China. Twenty percent of China's Hui population lives in Ningxia. - Zhongwei ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Zhngwèi ; Wade -- Giles : Chung - wei ; literally : \`\` middle guard '' ) is a prefecture - level city of Ningxia , People 's Republic of China .

It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang, and the Salar), and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia. Soviet writing reforms forced the Dungan to replace Xiao'erjing with a Roman alphabet and later a Cyrillic alphabet, which they continue to use up until today. - A prefecture (from the Latin \\"Praefectura\\") is an administrative jurisdiction or subdivision in any of various countries and within some international church structures, and in antiquity a Roman district governed by an appointed prefect. - The Hui people (Xiao'erjing: ; Dungan: , \\"Xuejzw\\") are a Chinese ethnic group which is composed predominantly of adherents of the Muslim faith and found throughout China, though they are concentrated mainly in the Northwestern provinces of the country and the Zhongyuan.

Question: \\"What is a kestrel?\\" Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Kestrel is a common name given to several species of small falcons in the genus Falco, primarily known for their hunting skill and adeptness in flying. These birds are widely distributed across various continents, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Features that characterize kestrels include their relatively small size, pointed wings, sharp beak, and strong talons, all of which make them formidable hunters, particularly efficient in capturing small mammals, reptiles, insects, and other birds. A fascinating aspect of kestrel behavior is their ability to detect ultraviolet light, which aids them in locating their prey. For instance, they can identify the reflective urine trail marks left by rodents, allowing them to track and hunt these animals more easily. This ability to perceive ultraviolet light expands their visual range beyond what humans can observe and plays a significant role in their foraging efficiency. While the larger context of the passage describes various adaptations in avian vision and anatomy, kestrels serve as a prime example of how these adaptations can provide a competitive advantage in the world of birds. For example, just like other birds, kestrels possess a nictitating membrane that helps to protect and lubricate their eyes. This membrane also functions as a contact lens, offering enhanced vision during hunting. Furthermore, kestrels share the general avian anatomical trait of having eyes either on the sides or front of their head, thereby affording them a wide visual field and sometimes even binocular vision. Although the passage does not explicitly mention kestrel's eye positioning, their other sensory adaptations likely contribute significantly to their hunting prowess. In summary, a kestrel is a small falcon recognized for its exceptional hunting capabilities and remarkable visual adaptations. It exemplifies how birds have developed unique physiological and behavioral characteristics to thrive in their respective ecological niches. The kestrel's ability to detect ultraviolet light and make use of various avian eye adaptations not only showcases the remarkable diversity within the avian class but also highlights the intricate evolutionary connections among species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Newcastle summer signing Remy Cabella claimed Alan Pardew made the right choice by dropping him for recent matches, admitting he has struggled with the Premier League's physicality. The 24-year-old France international finally arrived on Tyneside from Montpellier in July, almost seven months after the Magpies initially targeted him in the wake of Yohan Cabaye's January departure for Paris St Germain. However, the £7million man has found the pace and power of the Barclays Premier League a challenge and having started the first six league games, was taken out of the firing line for the trip to Swansea on October 4. Remy Cabella celebrates with Sammy Ameobi after the striker scored Newcastle's opener against Tottenham. But he returned as a half-time substitute at Tottenham on Sunday and provided the cross from which Ayoze Perez headed Pardew's men to a second successive victory, and he is now hoping that will provide him with a springboard to show what he can do on a sustained basis. Cabella told L'Equipe: 'It's logical. The coach had been starting me in the first two months, but I had not scored or had an assist. 'Dropping me to the bench, and indeed not playing me at all at Swansea, hurt my pride. But I have not eased off, I have worked more. Steven Taylor congratulates Cabella after the Frenchman provided the assist for Newcastle's second goal. 'He [Pardew] trusted me to play the second half [against Tottenham]. I got my first assist and it is good for the confidence. 'Alan Pardew wants me to be decisive, to score goals. Up to now, I have not done that. That is why I am not playing. 'Now I am only thinking about scoring. But I don't feel any pressure, that would be pointless. I am just here to play football, it is the best job.' Cabella said Alan Pardew was right to drop him for the trip to Tottenham as his form had been poor. Cabella freely admits the physicality of the Premier League came as a surprise, but insists he is gradually coming to terms with it. He said: 'I like England, it's another universe. It is another challenge in a new league, so of course it takes time to adapt. The rhythm and intensity of the game have surprised me. 'For 90 minutes, you attack, you defend, the referee doesn't whistle for anything. But after 90 minutes, you are dead!

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Damned United Context: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

Information: - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Mnak Hind\\") or simply Hindi (Devanagari: , \\"Hind\\"), is an Indian language and a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: It is 1955, somewhere in rural England. Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “Despite all that good news, there’s plenty of horror stories being told. All are untrue, but they’re being told all over America.” –Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), remarks on the floor of the Senate, Feb. 26, 2014 “I can’t say that every one of the Koch brothers’ ads are a lie, but I’ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.” –Reid, a few hours later By popular demand from readers, we will take a look at these statements by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) He made his comments as part of a harsh attack on the billionaire Koch brothers, who have backed Americans for Prosperity, a political group that has spent 30 million in the past six months, virtually all on ads attacking Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. At one point, he even declared, the brothers had “no conscience” and were “un-American” — political rhetoric that some might argue goes too far, given Reid’s office. Taken by itself, as a blanket comment that all tales of woe under the new law are false, Reid’s first statement appears ridiculous. But we don’t like to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. From the context — the focus on the Koch brothers — Reid appeared to be focusing on the tales told in the ads sponsored by AFP. After an eruption on Twitter and other social media, Reid returned to the floor to amend his statement: “I can’t say that every one of the Koch brothers’ ads are a lie, but I’ll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are.” “Senator Reid wanted to be accurate so he went back to the floor to correct the record,” said his spokesman Adam Jentleson. “Senator Reid’s argument is with the shadowy, secretive billionaires behind the ads who are spending millions to rig the system to benefit themselves and the corporations they control, not the people in the ads.” In other words, it appears Reid misspoke the first time, so we will evaluate his second statement. For the record, The Fact Checker awards Pinocchios but shies away from the word “lie” because it is such a harsh, personal judgment. The Pinocchio scale is based on the idea that there are various types of misstatements, some worse than others. By our count on You Tube, Americans for Prosperity has run about 50 anti-Obamacare ads since July. Many are repetitive or on the same theme, frequently citing PolitiFact’s designation of an Obama statement on the law as “Lie of the Year.” Some of the Obamacare ads even feature actors, not real people, which some people might argue crosses a line. But many of these ads have never been vetted by fact checkers. However, those that have faced scrutiny generally have not fared well. The Fact Checker, for instance, has examined five of these ads, and has given four of them Two Pinocchios. However, one received just a single Pinocchio, and we praised it for sticking relatively close to the facts for an attack ad. One ad The Fact Checker evaluated starred a women in Michigan named Julia Boonstra. We raised serious questions about her allegations in this ad—as did our colleagues at PolitiFact—and our analysis was cited by Paul Krugman in the New York Times. Reid, in turn, cited Krugman in his floor speech. PolitiFact, meanwhile, has looked at six of these ads. In two cases, it said it did not have enough facts for its Truth-O-Meter, but otherwise it awarded one “half true,” two “mostly false,” and one “false” for these ads. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org do not use a rating system, but have faulted two of the ads for lacking context or being wrong. We should note that AFP is very aggressive with its ads. In the past, it has earned Four Pinocchios from The Fact Checker, and more than 80 percent of its PolitiFact ratings have been Pants on Fire, False or Mostly False. (The percentage declines if you include ads that did not yield a rating.) It has never earned a True or Mostly True rating, which for some political organizations might be a badge of honor. Reid claimed that a “vast, vast majority” of AFP’s Obamacare ads are lies. Vast majority is an imprecise and hackneyed phrase, but presumably it is above 75 percent. We’re not sure what a “vast, vast majority” would be. We also are not sure what would qualify as a “lie” though on balance we might reserve that for Four Pinocchio or Pants on Fire and/or False statements. (Others might add “mostly false” and Three Pinocchio statements to the “lie” pile, but personally that seems to go too far.) But only one of the Obamacare ads vetted by the Fact Checker or PolitiFact achieved such ratings, though all had various problems and statements that went too far. Meanwhile, our colleague Greg Sargent has noted that two recent AFP ads, released after controversial Boonstra ad, appeared to go out of their way not to make statements that could be called into question. In this case, even Reid’s revised rhetoric went too far. He would have been on safer ground if he dropped the harsh rhetoric and had simply said that many of the ads have serious problems and even rely on actors, not real people.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Christian metal, also known as white metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. - Strange Celebrity was a Christian rock band, formed in Nashville, Tennessee, composing of four members: Luke Brown (lead vocals, guitar), Rick Wilson (drums), Quinton Gibson (guitar), and Tracy Ferrie (bass guitar). The band is now defunct, as Luke Brown has pursued a solo career. - Timothy \\"Tim\\" Gaines (born Timothy Hagelganz; December 15, 1962) is an American bass guitarist. He is most known for being the bassist of the Christian metal band Stryper. - Tracy Ferrie is the current touring bass player for the classic rock band Boston and was the former bass player of Christian metal band Stryper .

During mid- 2012 , Ferrie toured with Boston , replacing Kimberley Dahme . - Whitecross is a Christian metal band that formed in 1985 in Waukegan, IL releasing their first recording in 1987. Their early albums, which often invite comparisons to Ratt, are laced with fast, technical guitar work. In 1994, Rex Carroll split with lead vocalist Scott Wenzel. Scott retained the use of the name \\"Whitecross\\" while Carroll went on to form King James with Jimi Bennett (see below). At this point the band's sound underwent a drastic change. - Stryper is an American Christian heavy metal band from Orange County, California. The group's lineup consists of Michael Sweet (lead vocals, guitar), Oz Fox (guitar), Tim Gaines (bass guitar), and Robert Sweet (drums).

It may seem some people are just naturally better at word games than others, but it's not all down to luck - there are some tricks you can use to steal points from your opponents. According to UK Scrabble expert and Countdown champion Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different tips players can use to win, or at least boost their overall score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words, especially involving the 'X' tile, are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns, which are usually banned. According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different ways players can win, or at least boost their score. These include how to remember unusual words, why two-letter words are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns. Grossman suggests the more words in a person's vocabulary, the better, and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in Scrabble. For example:. Epopoeia - an epic poem. Psst - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously. Brrr - used to signify being cold. Barry - another word for a blunder. Euoi - cry of Bacchic frenzy. Qat - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub. Jiao - a monetary unit in China. In his book, 101 Ways to Win at Scrabble, Grossman explains that although proper nouns aren't generally accepted, there are some exceptions. For example, his own name Barry can be used as another word for a blunder or mistake. It is Australian slang. Equally 'danny' and plural 'dannies', is acceptable to describe a child's hand. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains that two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, but they can also be used to connect words. He goes on to say the 'X' tile, worth eight points in the game, either preceded or succeeded by a vowel gives a high-scoring combination for a low number of tiles used. These include 'ax', 'ex', 'xi' and 'xu'. Many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two-letter words, described as the 'glue' of Scrabble including jo, es and ta. Equally, there are a host of three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu that can be useful. Grossman's book adds that there are a handful of four-letter words that don't contain any vowels that are also accepted in Scrabble. These include psst, pfft, brrr and grrl - although Grossman points out that only these spellings are accepted, and extra 'F's, 'R's and 'S' can't be added. Another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents, as listed in Grossman's book, is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes. These included 'ed', 'ing' and adding the letter S to the end of words, yet Grossman adds the suffix 'ish' is rare and equally effective, especially on words such as pixyish. Elsewhere in his book, Grossman explains two-letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game, and to connect other words. Described as the 'glue' of Scrabble, these include jo, es and ta. Equally, three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu can be useful. The letter 'S' and the blank tile should be used sparingly, according to Grossman's book. An S, for example, should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points, otherwise it's a 'waste'. Another key thing to remember is that the letter 'Q' doesn't always need to be followed by a 'U'. In the two-letter list the word QI is 'a variant of chi'. While Qat (a variant spelling of the word khat; an evergreen shrub), Qaid (a Muslim chief) and sheqalim (the plural of sheqel, the currency of Israel) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used. Grossman suggests the more words in a. person's vocabulary, the better they are at Scrabble, and knowing the more rare and unusual. words can benefit the most. He doesn't insist players learn the dictionary, but it is worthwhile familiarising themselves with some of these unusual words, or words that use unusual letter combinations including epopoeia, an epic poem, and tchick, a clicking sound. For words that are difficult to spell, Grossman suggests creating a mnemonic to help players remember them, such as 'John Is Always Out' for the word jiao, a monetary unit in China. Ultimately, Grossman claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped, which means that player misses a go, but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result. The National Scrabble Championship final takes place on Sunday. Highlights:","completion":"1. UK Scrabble expert and Countdown champion, Barry Grossman, has compiled a list of at least 100 winning tips for word game enthusiasts to boost their overall game score. 2. Grossman's strategies include remembering unusual words, the tactical usage of two-letter words especially those involving an 'X', and knowing when it's permissible to use proper nouns. 3. Expanding one's vocabulary improves gameplay, and particularly benefits from knowing rare and unusual words, such as 'epopoeia'(an epic poem), 'psst', 'brrr', 'euoi'(cry of Bacchic frenzy), 'qat'(an evergreen shrub), and 'jiao'(a monetary unit in China). 4. His book, '101 Ways to Win at Scrabble,' explains the importance and strategic usage of two-letter words as a method for offloading tiles towards the end of a game and connecting other words. 5. Grossman advises the sparing use of 'S' and the blank tile. For example, an 'S' should only be utilised when it can increase the overall score by approximately five points. 6.

Please answer the following question: Title: The Song of the Cardinal Product review: I read this book when I was young and it bored me. Now as a senior citizen, I have been feeding the cardinals who live in my yard and I just love this book. Gene Stratton Porter is a very descriptive writer so you feel like you are seeing what she saw. I wish they would put The Keeper of the Bees on Kindle. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"The review provided for \\"The Song of the Cardinal\\" by Gene Stratton Porter can be considered to depict the product in a predominantly flattering light, with a minor unflattering aspect. The reviewer's change in perspective and appreciation for the book over time contributes to an overall positive impression. Here are the reasons why: 1. The reviewer's change in opinion: The review mentions that the individual initially found the book boring when they were young. However, as a senior citizen, their experiences with cardinals in their yard have led them to love the book. This change in perspective highlights that personal growth and experiences can greatly influence one's appreciation for a piece of literature. This aspect suggests that the book may be better suited for readers with a developed appreciation for nature or more life experiences to relate to the content or the author's writing style. 2. Descriptive writing praise: The review specifically commends Gene Stratton Porter's descriptive writing, stating that the reader feels like they are seeing what the author saw. This suggests that the book effectively immerses the reader in its world and allows them to connect with the author's experiences and emotions. This type of writing style will likely appeal to readers who enjoy vivid imagery, as it enables them to engage with the content on a deeper level. 3. A request for another book: The reviewer expresses their interest in seeing another Gene Stratton Porter book, \\"The Keeper of the Bees,\\" made available on Kindle. This request implies that they have enjoyed other works by this author and believe that their books are worth sharing with a wider audience. This further reinforces the positive image of the author, consequently reflecting positively on \\"The Song of the Cardinal.\\" However, the unflattering aspect arises from the reviewer's initial experience with the book. Their statement of finding the book boring when they were younger does create a slightly negative impression. This detail may discourage potential readers who are concerned that the book might not suit their taste, especially if they do not yet share the reviewer's newfound love and admiration for cardinals or have not yet experienced similar connections with nature. In conclusion, despite the initial negative impression, the review ultimately paints a largely flattering image of \\"The Song of the Cardinal.\\" The reviewer's personal growth, their praise for the author's writing style, and their interest in other works by the author contribute to an overall positive and appreciative impression of the book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose work's increased value has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries? is inside the article: Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute., can you guess it ?

Even assuming the man in the penguin suit is referred to as a 'penguin' in the hypothesis, the runner's action changes from 'being chased' to 'sitting'. We have no information about any occurrence of the runner stopping and sitting next to the penguin. Therefore, these differing contexts create enough discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis, implying that if the premise is true, we cannot automatically affirm the hypothesis to be true. It's worth noting, however, that the hypothesis could potentially occur after the stated premise, but we have no information to confirm this definitively. As presented, there is no logical or direct correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, deeming it impossible to conclude the hypothesis as true based solely on the premise."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

He died in hospital. \\"Northampton knows who did this,\\" Gary Brickwood said. \\"Dad was one of their own. I can't believe they'd let it go.\\" No-one has been charged. Mr Brickwood - a grandfather and father to sons Gary, Dale and Nathan - died after being attacked in his home in Lindsay Avenue, Abington, in the early hours of the morning. Gary, the eldest son, went to the house after being told of his father's death by his brother Dale. He said: \\"I saw all the blood on the stairs.

He hung his head and said, 'Yes'.\\" A scrap metal dealer, Mr Brickwood was known to keep money in his home and Gary maintains this was the motive. He said: \\"I don't think they meant to murder dad, but this was planned. He was watched. This was set up.\\" A BBC Crimewatch reconstruction showed one or more people breaking in, confronting Mr Brickwood and stabbing him before leaving with cash and jewellery.

Despite his family’s relentless search for answers and pursuit of justice, no one has been charged for the horrific crime. David Brickwood was attacked and stabbed five times in his Northampton home on Lindsay Avenue, Abington, in the early hours of the morning on September 26, 2015. He was a father to sons Gary, Dale, and Nathan, and a grandfather. Following the attack, he was admitted to the hospital but ultimately succumbed to his injuries. His eldest son, Gary, discovered the gruesome scene at his father's house after receiving news of the tragedy from his brother Dale. David Brickwood, a scrap metal dealer, was known to keep money in his home, which Gary believes was the motive behind the murder. While he doesn't think the killers intended to murder his father, he asserts that the attack was premeditated and carefully planned. A BBC Crimewatch reconstruction showed that one or more people broke into the house, confronted Brickwood, stabbed him, and took cash and jewelry before fleeing the scene. The horrifying experience of identifying his father's body and informing his siblings of the tragedy has left a lasting impact on Dale. One year later, the family is still desperately searching for answers, and Gary painfully reflects on his final moments with his father, wishing he had stopped by one more time before the deadly attack. Driven by grief and anger, Gary urges the people of Northampton to come forward with any information about the murderers, accusing them of being \\"gutless and spineless\\" for keeping silent. Despite their persistence, the family has not seen justice served for their father, and they remain hopeful that the community will ultimately come together to help solve the case. In an effort to keep the case alive and encourage new leads, the family held a candlelit vigil on Monday, and the police are expected to re-appeal for information regarding the murder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations – a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us – one with a trailer full of wood – but overall it really was fine.

Information: - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function. - Ernie Manouse ( born September 1 , 1969 , in Binghamton , New York ) is an American television host , radio personality , writer and producer . He currently hosts the interview show InnerVIEWS with Ernie Manouse , produced by HoustonPBS . His work with HoustonPBS has met critical acclaim in the southern United States , earning him numerous KATIE awards and regional Emmy Awards - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude. - Binghamton is a city in, and the county seat of, Broome County, New York, United States.

The population of the city itself, according to the 2010 census, is 47,376. - The Southern Tier is the counties of New York west of the Catskill Mountains along the northern border of Pennsylvania. It generally includes the counties that border Pennsylvania west of Delaware County, but definitions of the region vary widely. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties, which together had a population of 251,725 as of the 2010 census. From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NYPA Urban Area. In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well.

Movie title: Cyrano de Bergerac Context: In seventeenth-century Paris, poet and supreme swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac (JosÃ© Ferrer) stops a play from being shown because he ostensibly cannot stand the bombastic style of the principal actor, Montfleury (Arthur Blake). An annoyed aristocratic fop, the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), provokes him into a duel by tritely insulting Cyrano's enormous nose. Cyrano first mocks his lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert could have phrased it (much to the amusement of the audience). He then composes a ballade for the occasion on the spot and recites it during the sword fight. With the last line, he stabs his opponent. Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), Captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies of his victim's friends, but he is unconcerned. When Le Bret presses him to reveal the real reason he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw his beautiful cousin Roxane (Mala Powers) being smiled at by the actor. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of it being returned because of his nose. When he receives a request from Roxane to see her in the morning, he is finally emboldened to act. Then pastry chef and fellow poet Ragueneau (Lloyd Corrigan) approaches him for help. Ragueneau has learned that a nobleman he had mocked with his verses, the Comte De Guiche (Ralph Clanton), has hired a hundred ruffians to teach him a lesson. Cyrano escorts him, kills eight of the horde, and drives off the rest. The next day, before he can tell Roxane of his feelings, she informs him that she has fallen in love with a handsome guardsman, Christian de Neuvillette (William Prince), though she has not even spoken to him. Cyrano hides his devastation and agrees to help her. Cyrano befriends the young man and discovers that he is infatuated with Roxane, but is too inept with words to woo her. To help him, Cyrano composes Christian's love letters to Roxane, which she finds irresistible. Later, Christian decides he wants no...

These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties).

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Humans have been keeping animals as pets for tens of thousands of years, but Dr Jean-Loup Rault, an animal scientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, believes new companions are coming: robot pets. \\"Technology is moving very fast,\\" Rault told ABC News, \\"The Tamagotchi in the early 1990s was really the first robotic pet, and now Sony and other big companies have improved them a lot.\\" This may not _ pet lovers. After all, who would choose a plastic toy over a lovely puppy? But Rault argues that the robotic kind has a lot going for it: \\"You don't have to feed it, you don't have to walk it, it won't make a mess in your house, and you can go on a holiday without feeling guilty.\\" The technology also benefits those who are allergic to pets, short on space, or fearful of real animals. It's not clear whether robot pets can replace real ones. But studies do suggest that we can bond with these smart machines. People give their cars names and kids give their toy animals life stories. It's the same with robots. When Sony stopped its repair service for its robot dog Aibo in March 2014, owners in Japan held funerals. As an animal welfare researcher, Rault is concerned about how robotic pets could affect our attitudes towards live animals. \\"If we become used to a robotic companion that doesn't need food, water or exercises, perhaps it will change how humans care about other living beings,\\" he said. So are dogs and cats a thing of the past, as Rault predicts? For those who grew up with living and breathing pets, the mechanical kind might not do. But for our next generation who are in constant touch with smart technology, a future in which lovely pets needn't have a heartbeat might not be a far-fetched dream.

Do n't give up . \\" I knew that I would be letting him down if I did n't try , and the thought of disappointing him was unbearable to me . What does the father 's look tell the narrator ?","completion":"The father's look communicates a powerful and meaningful message to the narrator, one that is both encouraging and subtly persuasive. Through this nonverbal cue, the father conveys his belief in the importance of resilience, determination, and the acceptance of failure as an essential part of the journey towards success. He does not force his child to participate or continue on with the decision they initially made, but rather offers the choice with an understanding that it is ultimately up to them. However, his deliberate look serves to emphasize and remind the narrator of the underlying values he wishes to instill. This look appears to have a profound impact on the narrator, as it stirs a deep sense of responsibility and desire to live up to their father's expectations. The fear of disappointing him becomes a driving force for the narrator to push past any hesitations or doubts they may have about following through with their decision. It is evident that the narrator holds their father's opinion in high regard, and thus, this unspoken encouragement resonates deeply and motivates them to take their father's message to heart. The father's look, in essence, tells the narrator that they should not be afraid to face and overcome challenges, and should strive to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. It serves as a gentle reminder of the life lessons that the father wants to pass on to his child, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and determination in the pursuit of success. Simultaneously, it also conveys unconditional support and trust in the narrator's ability to make their own decisions, while silently urging them to push themselves and not give up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: The Rams meet the Broncos at home for the first time since their home opener in 2006. The Rams won 18-10. The injury-riddled Denver Broncos (7-2) travel to St. Louis, looking to extend their lead in the AFC West, but it was too late as the Rams defense harassed Peyton Manning and the Broncos offense all day long. Rams' quarterback Shaun Hill returned from injury and took over for Austin Davis, who started only a few games. Among the game's highlights was Rams safety Rodney McLeod taking a hit on Broncos' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, forcing Sanders to leave the game with a concussion. Officials later confirmed that the McLeod hit on Sanders was not illegal. The Rams won 22-7 and are tied one game apiece against all AFC West opponents. Question: How many total points did the Rams score in the two games against the Broncos? Answer type: Number A:","completion":"To answer this question, first, we need to find out how many points the Rams scored in each game against the Broncos. From the passage, we can see that: 1. In their home opener in 2006, the Rams won 18-10. 2. In the second game, the Rams won 22-7. Now, we need to add the number of scored points from each game: 18 (first game) + 22 (second game) = 40 So the total points scored by the Rams in the two games against the Broncos is 40.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. After reading the above, is \\"Sebastiao led 18,000 followers in a vain crusade in Morocco which led to their deaths\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What created a crisis of succession following this era of increased trade?\\"? pick from the following. (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(b). yes Sebastião led 18,000 followers in a vain crusade in Morocco which led to their deaths. This crisis of succession occurred because Sebastião's untimely demise left the throne empty with no clear heir, setting the stage for a crisis of succession. The excerpt mentions that the only rightful claimant was the elderly Prince Henry, who also died heirless two years later, ultimately leading to Spain occupying the power vacuum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They feel foolish for having done so. (B). They save the world.","completion":"Option (B): They save the world After the weeks-long incessant work, the team of scientists, led by the prodigious doctor, finally managed to develop a cure. This was no mean feat; it was a synthesis of breakthrough techniques, time, effort, global cooperation, and most importantly, the relentless hope that kept them all united. There was a palpable sense of relief, a moment of renewed hope, and an odd taste of victory over the microscopic enemy amongst them. The implications of their revolutionary discovery were clear: they might just have saved the world. Yet, their journey was just beginning. With the cure in hand, the group immediately began testing, ensuring the safety and efficacy of the treatment before they could apply it on a global scale. They worked carefully, abiding by the rigorous process required when making medical interventions, keeping in mind the repercussions of any oversight. As each day unfolded, the cure seemed to hold promise. It worked exceptionally well in the lab conditions — it was effective, efficient, and seemed to have no critical side effects. As they moved to the next phase, field trials, anxiety trickled into their hearts. The disease had spread far and wide, spanning continents and affecting millions. They knew that their greatest challenge lay ahead. Yet, fortified by the success they had seen in the lab, the scientists proceeded with the trials, administering the cure to a wide demographic spread while monitoring the reactions closely. Trials revealed substantial success. The disease's rampant spread started halting, its ferocity dwindling, the World Health Organisation reported. Statistics showed a decrease in infection rates, and slowly but surely, they witnessed a significant drop in the mortality rate. Assured by the early success, health institutions across the world began mass production and global distribution of the cure, aiming to reach the furthest corners and help as many individuals as possible. The struggle wasn't over, yet milestones were being met, hope was being rekindled, lives were being saved, and slowly the world started returning to normalcy. The fear started to lift, replaced instead with gratitude for the team of scientists who had dedicated their lives to developing this cure. These were the unsung heroes who had, in more ways than one, managed to save the world. From classrooms to dinner tables, talk of the disease transitioned from fear to a story of human resilience. The team's effort became an inspiration, a telling tale of the power of collaborative innovation. The tireless scientists didn't merely develop a cure, they became a symbol of humanity's unyielding spirit and its ceaseless fight against adversity. Humanity awakened to its possible demise, only to be steered back on the course by its protectors – the scientists who could, indeed, save the world. Thus is the choice worded: They save the world — not in the past tense, but in the present. For while the disease was indeed conquered, the effects of the scientists' work reverberated far beyond the cure itself. It transformed society's view of science, underlined the importance of global cooperation, and raised the level of respect for these diligent workers who, behind the scenes, safeguard humanity's survival every day. Herein lay their true victory: they did more than develop a cure; they left a lasting impact on human civilization. So indeed, they saved the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Summarize this article: BOSTON (Reuters) - The rising cost of higher education is dogging Americans into retirement, with people aged 65 and older still carrying some 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans, according to a federal report released on Wednesday. While the Government Accountability Office report noted that relatively few U.S. households headed by people 65 or over are carrying student loans, the value of the unpaid debt had spiked from 2.8 billion in 2005, before the financial crisis. That debt is concentrated in a small number of homes. Just 4 percent of households headed by someone 65 or older carried student loan debt as of 2010, up from 1 percent in 2004. \\"Some may think of student loan debt as a just a young person's problem,\\" said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, who heads a Senate committee on aging and held a hearing on the findings on Wednesday. \\"As it turns out, that's increasingly not the case.\\" The 18.2 billion figure includes loans related to both the holders' education, often for those who have returned to school later in life, and their children's education, the report found. Across the United States, about 40 million Americans are paying back some 1.1 trillion in student loan debt. Student loans are a particular concern because unlike credit card debt or mortgages, they are typically government-backed and cannot be written off in bankruptcy proceedings, leaving retirees facing the risk of having their Social Security payments garnished to cover student loans. The cost of higher education in the United States has steadily increased over the past decade, with one year's costs for tuition, room and board, and other fees at the average four-year U.S. college coming to 23,872 for the 2012-2013 academic year, according to Department of Education data. That is up 21 percent, accounting for inflation. \\"Education debt has become a significant factor for younger workers, threatening a middle-class standard of living and at times even forcing some to delay their retirement,\\" said Debra Whitman, an executive vice president at AARP, the largest lobbying group representing retired Americans. \\"Student loan debt is also becoming a matter of serious concern for some older Americans many of who are still paying off their kids' debt or helping their grandkids well into their ‎retirement.\\" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Mohammad Zargham) ||||| Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images Most conversations about the dangers of student debt rightfully focus on the young. But a surprising number of elderly Americans are also still paying back education loans. And today, the Government Accountability Office unveiled a rather depressing report about how the government may be driving some of those retirees into poverty in its attempts to collect on their debt. Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate’s senior business and economics correspondent. The problem stems from the way Washington handles defaults. Once a borrower has failed to pay back his federal loan for 425 days, the government has the power to withhold Social Security retirement and disability payments to offset the debt. In 2013, the GAO reports that 155,000 Americans, including 36,000 individuals older than 65, saw their benefits garnished in this fashion. Advertisement Because Social Security is designed to keep the elderly and infirm from falling into destitution, Congress very sensibly limited how much money the Treasury Department could withhold from their benefits when collecting on a student loan. Much less sensibly, the cap wasn’t indexed for inflation and hasn’t been updated since the 1990s. As a result, the GAO reports that, \\"the current limits may result in monthly benefits below the poverty threshold for certain defaulted borrowers.\\" To translate that into the clearest terms possible: Due to Congress' neglect, our government is now probably pushing somebody's grandparents into poverty so that they can settle up a bad college debt. Get Slate in your inbox. How many people are we talking about here? The report’s numbers are slightly opaque, but it looks like about 129,000 Americans total, including 27,000 senior citizens, would have kept more of their Social Security payments if the withholding limits had kept pace with the poverty line.1 We don’t know for sure that every one of these individuals is being driven into poverty, since some of them may have income from other sources. But the fact that we even have to worry about the possibility is disturbing. In the end, we’re only talking about a problem afflicting a relative handful of people. But that also means it would be fairly painless to fix. Fixing the withholding limits to make sure nobody’s benefit payments fell below the poverty level would have cost just 94 million in 2013. This does not seem like a hard trade-off to make. Of course, the really humane thing would be to finally let Americans discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, so they aren’t dogged by their borrowing mistakes deep into old age. But baby steps first. * * * ||||| Financial Aid Elderly Americans have more student loan debt than ever and are more likely to become chronically unable to make payments than younger borrowers. Those findings from a new report by the Government Accountability Office took center stage at Wednesday’s Senate hearing on how seniors deal with unprecedented education debt. Federal student debt among Americans 65 and older increased sixfold since 2005, reaching 18.2 billion in 2013, according to the report. Over 80 percent of elderly borrowers were still struggling to pay off loans they took out to pay for their education, which suggests that the debt ballooned, in part, due to interest. United States Government Accountability Office Seniors hold a small minority of all student debt in the country, but their fate is a cautionary tale for today’s students taking out more and bigger loans. It is also a sign of financial stress to come for people who are heading toward retirement. Some 31 percent of the student loans held by Americans aged 65 and older were in default last year. That makes the elderly about twice as likely to hold defaulted loans as Americans under the age of 50. Defaulting on student loans is bad for anyone: It can harm your credit and multiply your debt by adding fees. For older Americans, the consequences can be especially dire. United States Government Accountability Office More elderly Americans are seeing retirement benefits cut to order to repay education debt, as Bloomberg Businessweek reported last month. The government reduced the Social Security payments or other retirement benefits of 155,000 people last year to pay off student loans, according to the new GAO report, up from just 31,000 in 2002. A 1998 law specified that the government could not seize more than 15 percent of people’s retirement benefits or leave them with a check of less than 750. At the time that limit was above the poverty line. The limit hasn’t since increased and is now about 181 under the poverty threshold for a person over the age of 65. Most of those who saw Social Security payments slashed to repay student loans in 2013 were living on benefit income that was under the poverty line. “If the offset limit had been indexed to match the rate of increase in the poverty threshold,” the report noted, “in 2013, 68 percent of all borrowers whose Social Security benefits were offset for federal student loan debt would have kept their entire benefit.” |||||","completion":"According to a federal report, the rising cost of higher education is causing issues for older Americans, with people aged 65 and above still carrying around 18.2 billion in unpaid student loans.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle.

Next, we need to simplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms (the terms with the same variable, i.e., i). In this case, both terms have the variable i, so we can combine them: 424 = 53*i 3. Now, we need to isolate the variable i by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable (53). Dividing by 53, we get: 424 / 53 = 53*i / 53 4. Simplifying the equation, we obtain: 8 = i So, the value of the variable i in the given equation is 8."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I have a new situation: Large birds are natural predators of rodents. Unfortunately, rodents consume crops in farmlands. In recent years, use of chemicals in agriculture has seen reduced number of large birds in Germany. But in some places in France farmers are cautions about using chemicals in agriculture. As a result, large bird population had been stable in France. But I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. What is an answer for this question: Which country would see less crops produced, France or Germany?","completion":"To answer the question of which country would see less crops produced, let's analyze the given information step-by-step: 1. Large birds are natural predators of rodents. 2. Rodents consume crops in farmlands. 3. Chemicals in agriculture have reduced the number of large birds in Germany. 4. Farmers in some places in France are cautious about using chemicals, and as a result, large bird populations have remained stable. Now, let's connect these pieces of information: - In Germany, the use of chemicals in agriculture has reduced the large bird population. - Since large birds are predators of rodents, this could lead to an increased number of rodents in Germany. - Increased rodent population might result in more crop consumption, leading to less overall crop production. On the other hand: - In France, the stable large bird population due to the cautious use of chemicals might keep the rodent population in check. - Fewer rodents would mean less consumption of crops, which might result in more overall crop production. Based on this analysis, it seems that Germany would likely see less crop production compared to France due to the reduced number of large birds and potential increase in rodent population consuming crops. However, it's important to keep in mind that many other factors could influence crop production in both countries. This answer is based solely on the provided information about large birds, rodents, and chemical use in agriculture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The game was a shootout as Russell Wilson, playing on his 27th birthday, passed for 345 yards and threw five touchdown passes (three of them to WR Doug Baldwin).

OPT: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze the meanings of the two sentences step by step: 1. In the first sentence, the speaker is expressing their anticipation for \\"one of those days.\\" They use \\"oh\\" to emphasize their enthusiasm, and the phrase \\"look forward to\\" denotes that the speaker feels excitement or eagerness about a specific situation or event. 2. In the second sentence, the speaker simply states that they \\"looked forward to those days.\\" This sentence conveys that the speaker was anticipating a series of instances or events in the past. Here, the focus is on the past tense, whereas, in the first sentence, the focus is on the present tense and anticipation of future events. Now, let's see if the second sentence can be logically derived from the first sentence: - The first sentence talks about looking forward to one instance (\\"one of those days\\"). - The second sentence talks about looking forward to multiple instances (\\"those days\\"). Given this differentiation in the number of instances, we cannot conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which the introduced small interfering RNA (siRNA) could cause the degradation of mRNA with identical sequence speci¢city. The RNAi methodology has been used as a tool to silence genes in cultured cells and in animals. Recently, this technique was employed in anti-virus infections in human immunode¢ciency virus and hepatitis C/B virus. In this study, RNAi technology has been applied to explore the possibility for prevention of SARS-CoV infection. We constructed speci¢c siRNAs targeting the S gene in SARS-CoV. We demonstrated that the siRNAs could e¡ectively and speci¢cally inhibit gene expression of Spike protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Our study provided evidence that RNAi could be a tool for inhibition of SARS-CoV. ß 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years.\\", answer the following question.

Who was British Prime Minister from 1922-23, shortly before he died?","completion":"The British Prime Minister from 1922-1923, shortly before he died, was Andrew Bonar Law. Born on September 16, 1858, in Rexton, New Brunswick, Canada, Bonar Law was a prominent British Conservative politician who served as the leader of the Conservative Party from 1911 to 1921 and became Prime Minister following the resignation of David Lloyd George in October 1922. Bonar Law's tenure as Prime Minister was brief, spanning only from October 23, 1922, to May 20, 1923. During his time in office, his government focused on supporting the restoration of the British economy, which had been severely affected by World War I. He also worked towards the resolution of the Irish Question and signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State and ended the Irish War of Independence. The circumstances surrounding Bonar Law's ultimate departure from office were tragic. In early 1923, he began experiencing severe throat pain, which was subsequently diagnosed as terminal throat cancer. Recognizing that his health was rapidly deteriorating and that he was unable to fulfill the demanding responsibilities of a prime minister, Bonar Law submitted his resignation on May 20, 1923, after serving just 211 days – making his tenure one of the shortest in British history. Tragically, Bonar Law succumbed to his illness just six months later, passing away on October 30, 1923. Despite his brief time as Prime Minister, Bonar Law's influence on British politics was significant. Throughout his political career, he was highly regarded for his moral integrity, dedication to public service, and pragmatic, non-confrontational leadership style – all of which endeared him to colleagues and the public alike. While his lasting impact may be difficult to quantify due to the brevity of his time in office, Bonar Law is remembered as a respected and influential figure in early 20th-century British politics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: +Yes. +No. The answer is:","completion":"No. The right answer to the question \\"beef jerky is what?\\" is not \\"wet,\\" given that beef jerky is preserved. Beef jerky is a popular snack made from lean cuts of beef (or other types of meat, such as turkey) that have been trimmed of fat and then dried or smoked to preserve them. First, the meat is marinated in a mixture of spices, herbs, and other flavorings, which typically includes salt, sugar, soy sauce, and various spices. The marination process not only adds flavor but also helps to preserve the meat by introducing antimicrobial agents and reducing the water content. After marinating, the meat is placed on racks or hung in a smoker (if available) to allow for even air circulation during the drying process. It can be dried using a dehydrator, smoker, or even in an oven with the door slightly ajar at a low temperature. The drying process generally takes several hours, depending on the thickness of the meat and the desired level of dryness. During the drying process, the water content of the meat is reduced, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and helps preserve the meat for an extended period. The final product is a chewy, flavorful snack that can be stored for months without refrigeration. As a result, labeling beef jerky as \\"wet\\" is incorrect, as the preservation process aims to reduce moisture levels and reveal a predominantly dry texture. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe beef jerky as a dehydrated, preserved, and seasoned meat snack. The low moisture content, combined with added preservatives and salt, contributes to its relatively long shelf life and makes it a popular and convenient option for travel, camping, or simply a protein-packed snack."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Given the following context: The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without.

Sir Osbert Lancaster, CBE (4 August 1908 – 27 July 1986) was an English cartoonist, architectural historian, stage designer and author. He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. The only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at Charterhouse School and Lincoln College, Oxford, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to The Architectural Review in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including \\"Pont Street Dutch\\" and \\"Stockbrokers' Tudor\\", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject. In 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to The Daily Express. He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these \\"pocket cartoons\\", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, Maudie Littlehampton, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day. From his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, Pineapple Poll. Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the Royal Ballet, Glyndebourne, D'Oyly Carte, the Old Vic and the West End.

As such, I don't have the accent, but still connect deeply to my culture; Hindi is my first language, and I visit Delhi to see my family every year. I grew up pretty well-off, but both of my parents grew up in abject poverty, and raised me humbly. The school I went to was filled with rich kids, who would often not realize the privileged position they were in. Casual conversation at my school was often about which holiday home in the Mediterranean they were visiting this spring, and I generally felt pretty out of place. Many of my friends are British, and often fiercely patriotic. They have a tendency to make jokes that make me feel uncomfortable, such as attending a fancy dress party dressed as \\"the Sun setting on the British Empire\\", and saying things such as \\"you're only allowed to be proud of where you're from if you're from Britain\\", among countless other examples. Whenever I previously expressed discomfort, they would often play it off as them trying to be \\"edgy\\" or \\"ironic\\". One comment that made me particularly outraged was when one of them got into a fight with one of our mutual friends, who is Japanese, and blurted out \\"President Truman didn't do enough; he should have dropped three bombs\\" (or something to that effect) (I went absolutely ballistic at her for that one. Haven't had a conversation with her since, don't intend to). For a while, I kept mute. I'm generally not outgoing, and have found a group of friends who I generally enjoyed hanging out with, aside from in instances like this. I am afraid of jeopardizing that. Recently however, particularly after the New Zealand attacks, I've been calling them out. In one heated exchange, I told a friend that her \\"jokes\\" were what normalized white supremacy. I'm certain that the comments they make don't come from genuine malicious intent, but I feel as though I'm drifting from my group of friends because I don't find them funny. I feel as though that sort of normalization is what often leads me to feel ashamed of my own skin color and my heritage. My family, particularly my grandparents, had a poor relationship with the British. My grandfather lost three of his siblings when he was forced to leave his home during the partition. I understand that I was not a direct victim of colonization, and I also understand that my friends who make these jokes are not the direct perpetrators.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The device in the circuit in Figure above is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below . Q: What device measures current that flows through wire? A: A:","completion":"An ammeter is the device that measures the current flowing through a wire. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the device in the circuit shown in the Figure above is an ammeter. The ammeter's purpose is to measure the amount of electric current that flows through a specific point in a circuit. It can typically do this without interrupting the flow of current. The paragraph further explains that the faster the magnet or coil moves within the circuit, the greater the amount of current produced. This is due to the changing magnetic field that induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the wire, which ultimately causes current to flow. Adding more turns to the coil within the circuit increases the strength of the magnetic field, resulting in a higher current being generated. Moreover, if the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would continually change direction, producing what is known as alternating current (AC). AC is the type of current commonly used in most household and commercial electrical systems, as it allows for easy transmission of electricity over long distances and convenient transformation of voltage levels. In conclusion, an ammeter is the device responsible for measuring the current that flows through a wire in a given circuit. It is an essential tool for understanding and analyzing the behavior of various electronic circuits and systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners? Answer the above question based on the context below: John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators. Answer:","completion":"The person who is re-making the garden that was seen as a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners is Troy Scott Smith. He was given the role of head gardener in 2014 and had formerly been the head gardener at Bodnant. Scott Smith is the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He understands the significant challenges that come with taking care of the garden in the manner envisioned by its creator post their departure. He respects and upholds the garden's legacy while also seeking to innovate and enhance its appeal to visitors. In line with his philosophy, he announced in 2018 that he was planning to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst into the winter months. This would pave the way for the garden to stay open throughout the year, as opposed to being restricted to the autumn period which was a norm established by Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger. One of Scott Smith's restoration endeavors involves reintroducing every species of rose that was known to have been cultivated by the previous owner, Vita Sackville-West. He aims to cherish and carry forward the garden's past while also modifying certain aspects to keep up with the contemporary tastes and requirements Well-known gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, in writing about Scott Smith's overhaul of the garden in 2015, stated that \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion.

Question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. After each week you should probably A. think about diet B. check results C. weigh in D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"To reach your weight-loss goal, it is crucial to remain committed and motivated throughout the process. Two important tips that can help you achieve your goal are: 1. Take It a Week at a Time: Breaking down your ultimate goal into smaller, manageable chunks is an effective strategy for staying motivated. The Mayo Clinic recommends aiming to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week, as this is a healthy and achievable rate. This approach allows you to focus on your week-by-week progress, which can help to boost your confidence and maintain your determination. Be sure to take into account your current health condition and lifestyle, and commit to a healthy diet, regular exercise, and sufficient rest. Keeping your weekly weight-loss target realistic and clear will enable you to more easily stay on track and achieve success over time. 2. Regularly Assess Your Progress: After each week, take the time to evaluate your progress and make any necessary adjustments. This may include: A. Reevaluating your diet: Assess whether the dietary choices you are making are contributing to your weekly weight-loss goals, and make changes as needed. B. Checking your results: Monitor your progress by recognizing the achievements you have made toward your goal thus far. If you find that you are not meeting your target, consider whether you need to adjust your expectations or examine your approach. C. Weighing in: Weekly weigh-ins can help provide accountability and insight into your progress. As long as you keep in mind that weight fluctuations are normal, consistently tracking your weight can help you recognize trends and determine areas for improvement. D. Honest introspection: Reflect on your experiences and emotions throughout your weight-loss journey. Engage in self-examination to determine whether you are putting too much pressure on yourself, or whether your goals and methods are suitable for your individual situation. Making adjustments to your plan based on your personal reflection can enhance your long-term success. By taking your weight-loss journey one week at a time and consistently evaluating your progress, you can set realistic goals, make necessary adjustments, and ultimately achieve your desired weight-loss results. Remember that there is no \\"one size fits all\\" approach, so finding a plan that works specifically for your lifestyle is essential. With diligence, patience, and commitment, you can successfully reach your weight-loss goal and maintain optimal well-being."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Magic earrings for the following movie plot: Valerie [Jaroslava Schallerová] has just come of age with her first bleeding.

Babischka then shows up as Valerie's second cousin Elsa, young, beautiful, and vampire. When Valerie learns that the Vampire is dying and must have blood, she steals a chicken and feeds him the blood off her lips.A visiting priest, another of Babischka's lovers, tells Valerie that her father was also Orlik's father, which greatly disturbs Valerie to find that she and Orlik are brother and sister, but she is more disturbed when the priest attempts to seduce her, so upset in fact that she kills herself with her magic earrings.

Although the PC market declined, Apple still managed to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the majority of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks, although there were dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air. The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to \\"OS X experience, full keyboard, superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction\\". The Air was among the first to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air.

Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011. The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes.

Due to anti-death penalty advocacy and the European Union's ban on exporting products that could be used in executions, both drugs have faced supply constraints in the United States, causing difficulties for those seeking to use them in this context.

He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers.

Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking whether bamboo produces less heat when cooking, considering the fact that microwaves cook food using less heat.

This process requires much less heat than conventional cooking methods. Step 3: Analyze the role of bamboo in cooking Bamboo is a versatile and sustainable material, often used for making utensils, bowls, and other cooking tools. In some cooking techniques, bamboo is used as a steamer or a container that holds food while it cooks. However, bamboo itself does not have a direct impact on the amount of heat used for cooking. Step 4: Make a conclusion While using a bamboo container or utensil could contribute to more sustainable cooking practices, the heat generated in cooking depends on the cooking method itself (using less heat in a microwave, for example). Bamboo in itself doesn't produce less heat when cooking; it is the cooking method that matters. Therefore, the answer is (ii) No."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Love is an American rock group that was most prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They were originally led by singer/songwriter Arthur Lee, who wrote most of the songs, although some of their best known songs were written by Bryan MacLean. One of the first racially diverse American bands, their music drew on a diverse range of sources including folk rock, hard rock, blues, jazz, flamenco and orchestral pop. While finding only modest success on the music charts, Love would come to be praised by critics as one of the finest and most important American rock groups of their era. Signed to the Elektra Records label as their first rock act, the band scored a minor hit single in 1966 with their version of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \\"My Little Red Book\\". Their first album, Love, was released in March 1966. The album sold moderately well and reached No. 57 on the Billboard 200 chart. In August 1966 the single written by Arthur Lee \\"7 and 7 Is\\", notable for the exceptional guitar work of Johnny Echols and proto-punk styled drumming by Pfisterer, became their highest-charting single at No. 33 in the Billboard Hot 100. Two more members were added around this time, Tjay Cantrelli (real name John Barbieri) on woodwinds and Michael Stuart on drums. Pfisterer, never a confident drummer, switched to harpsichord. Their musical reputation largely rests on the next two albums, Da Capo and Forever Changes. Da Capo, released in November 1966, included \\"7 and 7 Is\\" as well as the subsequent singles \\"She Comes in Colors\\" and \\"!Que Vida!\\" and MacLean's \\"Orange Skies\\". Cantrelli and Pfisterer soon left the band, leaving it as a five-piece once again. Forever Changes, released in November 1967 and recorded and co-produced by Bruce Botnick is a suite of songs using acoustic guitars, strings, and horns that was recorded while the band was falling apart as the result of various substance abuse problems and tension between Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean, who wanted more of his songs on the album. The band recorded the album in only 64 hours, though many professional session players were utilized, including some who replaced the actual band members in some songs. Writer Richard Meltzer, in his book The Aesthetics of Rock, commented on Love's \\"orchestral moves\\", \\"post-doper word contraction cuteness\\", and Lee's vocal style that serves as a \\"reaffirmation of Johnny Mathis\\". Forever Changes included one hit single, Bryan MacLean's \\"Alone Again Or\\", while \\"You Set the Scene\\" received airplay from some progressive rock radio stations. By this stage, Love were far more popular in the UK, where the album reached No. 24, than in their home country, where it could only reach No. 154. More recently the album has received recognition as one of the greatest rock albums of all time, appearing on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and being added to the National Recording Registry.

Based on the sentence \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\", is the sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, fundamentally, the sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" can be considered true when compared with the statement \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\". Let's break this down to better understand. Although the two sentences do not have identical wording, they describe a similar action and scenario. In the first sentence, \\"A man in a blue shirt walking out a door.\\" signifies a particular event. It describes a man, specifically one in a blue shirt, who is in the process of walking out a door. The second sentence, \\"A person goes through a door.\\", is more general. It doesn't mention the gender or any specific characteristics of the person, like what they are wearing, nor does it specify the direction of movement, i.e., in or out. What the two sentences share is the primary action, which is someone (either a man or a person) moving through a door. If we dissect these sentences conceptually: 1. \\"A man\\" in the first sentence is a subset of \\"A person\\". A man is a person. 2. \\"Walking out a door\\" in the first sentence describes a more specific version of \\"goes through a door\\". 'Walking out' and 'going through' ultimately convey the same general event - a person moving through a doorway. While the first sentence provides more context and details about the scene, the second sentence maintains the core essentials -- a person and a door. They both describe the same basic action - a person moving through a door. Therefore, even though the second sentence is less specific than the first, we can consider the second sentence as essentially a simplified version of the first. Thus, based on the context provided by the first sentence, the second sentence \\"A person goes through a door.\\" can be taken as a true sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Frank Baum, the author of the famous children's novel \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" and its sequels, led a life that spanned different locations in the United States. Born as Lyman Frank Baum on May 15, 1856, in Chittenango, New York, he spent the early years of his life with his family in that region. His parents, Cynthia Ann Cynthia Stanton and Benjamin Ward Baum, were affluent, which influenced the various occupations and pursuits Frank would undertake throughout his life. In 1869, the Baum family relocated to Syracuse, New York, where L. Frank Baum enjoyed the privileges of attending a prestigious school called Syracuse Classical School. Later, he briefly attended Peekskill Military Academy, north of Manhattan, for two years. However, he left the academy due to health issues and returned to Syracuse. In his 20s, Baum moved from New York to South Dakota, motivated by the discovery of gold in the Black Hills. In 1888, he settled in Aberdeen with his wife, Maud Gage Baum, and started a novelty goods store called Baum's Bazaar. A few years later, he shifted his working interests and launched a newspaper named The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, which he edited and published. Unfortunately, both the store and the newspaper eventually folded due to financial difficulties. In 1891, Baum and his family moved to Chicago, Illinois. While in Chicago, he worked as a newspaper reporter and also entered into the then-thriving industry of window display design. His experiences in these fields contributed to the foundation of his career as a writer. He began submitting stories, articles, and poems to various publications, often adopting different pseudonyms to increase his chances of being published. It was during his time in Chicago that Baum started writing stories for young readers, culminating in the publication of \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" in 1900. The book's success set the stage for the remainder of Baum's life and career, making him one of the most beloved children's authors of the time. In 1910, Baum decided to move his family once again, this time to California. He settled in the coastal city of Coronado, building a house which he named Ozcot. Baum's fondly creative naming style echoed the whimsical worlds he built through his books. In California, he engaged in filmmaking and scriptwriting as an extension of his storytelling skills. Baum passed away in Hollywood, California, on May 6, 1919. In summary, L. Frank Baum lived in several locations throughout his life, including Chittenango and Syracuse, New York; Aberdeen, South Dakota; Chicago, Illinois; and Coronado and Hollywood, California. Each of these places had an impact on his experiences and the evolution of his writing career, making him a notable figure in American literary history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Really brief we have used this urgent care twice because it is convenient to our house but we will not go back. My 35 year old husband went here for prolonged fever over 102 degreesfor six days he was sent home with ATB for sinus infection. He developed severe abdominal pain after day one and by day 7 was still very sick. Since we could not get in to see PCP for another week we had to go back there today. My husband went alone until I could drop off our son and catch up with him before/while he met with the provider. When I arrived I was told by the front office staff he was meeting with the \\"Dr.\\" (who was actually a PA) and they would not interrupt him. I explained that I drove there just to be in on the office visit -- I was told someone would come and get me shortly. About 7 minutes after arriving my husband walked out and said he was told to \\"let it run its course.\\" I called the office to speak to the office manager regarding the lack of integrating family (myself) into the office visit and was told she would call me back. I called again 4 hours later and spoke with the office staff explaining I wanted to complain about my experience of being excluded from being a part of my husbands office visit and she said \\"she is very busy I don't know if she can call you back.\\" I am writing this review because most people will not patronize a business when they know the business philosophy reflects disdain for the customers experience.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: How does Nigeria feel about Trump's comments?

An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story. It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. In turn, Richard Widmark {bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire}, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic. Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece. From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior. It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of the descendant of Robert Campbell? from the following article ? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Determine the sentiment: The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called \\"Nandini vs. Narasimha\\". India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar, it is beautiful. The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension. The film's biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen, Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress, Deepti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway, do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.","completion":"The sentiment in this review is mostly positive.

[i] no [ii] yes","completion":"[ii] yes Both Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 convey the same information, despite the slightly different structures used in each sentence. They both inform the reader that the 1982-83 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) was the 37th season of the league. The use of the em dash in Sentence 1 and the phrasing \\"from 1982 to 83\\" in Sentence 2 both indicate the same time period for the season, which is from 1982 to 1983. While Sentence 1 employs an em dash to separate the date from the main clause, Sentence 2 chooses the preposition \\"from\\" to indicate the same time span. This distinction does not change the overall meaning of both sentences, as they still indicate the same NBA season and its chronological position. The events mentioned in the sentences and the details they provide are the same, albeit presented using alternative wording and punctuation.

She loves them A:","completion":"Title: Art of the Heart Genre: Romantic Comedy-Drama Plot Summary: Art of the Heart follows Stephanie, an aspiring film critic and journalist with a passion for cinema, and Guido, an independent filmmaker known for his controversial yet thought-provoking films. The story revolves around the complex and transformative love-hate relationship between Stephanie and Guido's movies, as they navigate through the ups and downs of the competitive film world, ultimately connecting on a personal and creative level. Stephanie, a 28-year-old woman with a Master's in Film Studies, is an avid movie aficionado with a preference for thought-provoking films that challenge viewers' perceptions. Although a sharp critic of commercial mainstream films, Stephanie stumbles across a hidden gem: a collection of rough and edgy movies by the lesser-known but immensely talented Guido. He's an Italian-American filmmaker in his early 30s whose films often tackle societal issues and personal struggles. Initially, Stephanie is transfixed by Guido's movies, praising his work in her blog and even writing an in-depth analysis of one of his films as part of her job application to a prestigious film magazine. Enchanted by Guido's unusual storytelling style, she quickly becomes engrossed in his fusion of social themes with raw, vivid character portrayals. One day, Stephanie gets the opportunity to attend a film festival where Guido is showcasing his latest film. Full of anticipation and excitement, Stephanie eagerly waits for their first encounter, only to witness a polarizing response from the festival audience. Some people love Guido's film, while others criticize it for being too radical and unrestrained. Amid the heated discussion, Stephanie approaches Guido, who is feeling disheartened by the mixed reactions, and they strike up a conversation. She confidently defends his work, sparking a lively debate that leads to a newfound friendship. As Stephanie and Guido grow closer, they discover a shared love for the power of cinema and storytelling, fueling their creative partnership. They collaborate on Guido's next film project, injecting Stephanie's critical perspective and balancing it against Guido's bold filmmaking style. However, as challenges mount during the production process, their relationship begins to strain. During one particularly grueling day on set, Stephanie criticizes Guido's stubborn and uncompromising approach to filmmaking. Simultaneously, Guido accuses Stephanie of prioritizing her career and craving acceptance from the elitist film community, thereby causing the duo to have a falling out. In the aftermath of the argument, both Stephanie and Guido reflect on the meaning and impact of their work and relationship. Stephanie realizes that her love for Guido's films was never about blind adoration but rather an appreciation for the thought-provoking, emotional resonance that his films invoke. Guido comes to understand that Stephanie's criticisms, stemming from her love for him and his movies, have ultimately helped to elevate his art. In a climactic scene near the end, Stephanie publishes a heartfelt, nuanced review of Guido's latest film. Gaining widespread attention in the film community, the review offers a balanced take on Guido's work – highlighting both its strengths and areas for growth. Guido reads Stephanie's review, finally understanding her perspective, and acknowledges the significance of her influence on his filmmaking. With newfound clarity, Guido reaches out to Stephanie, and they reunite under the dim lights of a classic movie theater, rekindling their love for each other and their shared passion for cinema. As the credits roll on the screen before them, their story illustrates that love and hate reside on a spectrum – and in the art of filmmaking, as well as in matters of the heart, both can play a transformative role."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Against this background, a \\"great assembly\\" was organised by the Manchester Patriotic Union formed by radicals from the Manchester Observer. The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester.

The band are taken to an underground facility, where their memories are removed to disks and their blue skin changed to make them resemble humans.

Article:Thousands defied a ban to protest, taking to the streets of Minsk and other cities. Demonstrators shouted \\"Fascists!\\" at riot police. There have been weeks of sporadic protests against a 230 (Â£185) levy on those unemployed for six months. President Alexander Lukashenko insists the tax will not be scrapped. He says it instils discipline in the workshy, though he has suspended it for this year. Opponents say it punishes those who cannot find a job. Organisers called the protest Freedom Day, evoking the independent Belarus that lasted just six months after the First World War, in 1918. The march in the capital Minsk took place on the 99th anniversary of the proclamation of the Belarusian People's Republic. Demonstrators tried to march down one of the major streets in Minsk, but were blocked by police who began arresting them, along with journalists covering the protest. \\"They're beating the participants, dragging women by the hair to buses. I was able to run to a nearby courtyard,\\" demonstrator Alexander Ponomarev told AP news agency. Earlier, police raided the offices of human rights group Vesna and detained about 30 activists. The authorities had already jailed more than 100 opposition supporters for terms of between three and 15 days in the lead-up to the demonstration, reports said. It seemed like the whole city was in a state of emergency - police everywhere, a lot of police trucks, water cannons, cars with equipment for storming barricades. We heard that people who were unable to get to the first meeting place, the Science Academy metro station, gathered in another place - Yakub Kolas square. There we saw a crowd with white-red-white flags, which are a symbol of opposition in Belarus. The crowd was around 1,000-1,500 strong. We started filming there. People shouted \\"long live Belarus\\". Very soon riot police appeared. In a couple of minutes police blocked the whole street from both sides. Protesters were surrounded. Several police trucks were sent in and arrests started. Riot police started to detain literally everyone, even some journalists and old people were detained. Those who were trying to resist were beaten. Earlier this month Mr Lukashenko said people who worked fewer than 183 days a year would not have to pay the tax this year and said those who had already paid it last year would be compensated if they found a job. According to a recent tax inspection, 470,000 people should have paid the tax but only 50,000 had done so, Reuters news agency said. Mr Lukashenko has run Belarus - a country where little dissent is tolerated - since 1994. He has been described by some Western officials as \\"Europe's last dictator\\". However, Mr Lukashenko has recently been seeking to improve ties with the West and lessen the country's dependence on Russia.

Hypothesis: The man has his eyes closed in the park. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise of a man in a suit taking a nap in the park, we can reasonably infer certain conclusions related to the hypothesis that the man has his eyes closed in the park. When someone takes a nap, it generally implies that the person is briefly resting or sleeping. In most cases, people close their eyes while sleeping. Therefore, it can be inferred that the man in the suit most likely would have his eyes closed as he takes a nap in the park. However, it is important to acknowledge some potential variables that could impact this conclusion. 1. Sleep behavior: Although it is typical for people to close their eyes while sleeping, a small percentage of individuals might exhibit different sleep behaviors, such as partially closed or open eyes during sleep. If the man in the suit belongs to this group, he might not have his eyes fully closed while napping in the park. 2. Resting without actually sleeping: \\"Taking a nap\\" may be interpreted in different ways by different people. Some may view napping as a brief period of actual sleep, while others could see it as just a moment to rest and recharge without falling asleep. If the man in the suit is simply resting without sleeping, he could have his eyes open or closed, depending on his preference. 3. Distractions or interruptions: External factors in the park, such as noise or an uncomfortable resting spot, could cause the man to briefly open his eyes during his nap. In this case, his eyes might not always be closed while he attempts to take a nap. Despite these potential variables, it is generally plausible to conclude, based on the premise, that the man in the suit has his eyes closed while taking a nap in the park. Nonetheless, it is advisable to consider the different factors and contexts that may influence the situation before making a definitive conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Falling from grace and teetering on the brink of relegation, both clubs knew that everything was on the line for their fans and the cities they represent. As the final whistle blew, both teams' fate was sealed with a nail-biting draw and a joint sigh of relief. Ewood Park was a mixture of nerves and excitement as Blackburn Rovers and Bristol City geared up to face each other in a match that would not only prove their mettle as Championship contenders but would also help shape the future of the clubs. Moments into the match, it was clear that the stakes could not have been higher. Both teams played with ferocity and determination, eager to climb the ladder and put as much distance between them and the dreaded relegation zone as possible. The expansive green of Ewood Park quickly became a battleground, a stark reminder of the tough sport football can be.

As the first half drew to a close, the goals remained elusive, but the intensity on the pitch continued to rise. The players contested every ball, fought for every inch and tackled fiercely, mindful of what a win would mean for their survival in the league. As the second half kicked off, the urgency ramped up, and more opportunities began to unfold. Fans at Ewood Park held their breath with each chance – no one daring to look away as the drama continued to unfold. Both teams pushed forward, threatening to break the deadlock. Coaches were seen pacing the sidelines, shouting instructions and urging on their players, knowing all too well that a single moment of brilliance or lapse in concentration could make or break the game. Soon, the hard-fought battle spilled into a stream of goals from both sides. The deadlock was broken, and the scoring began in earnest. The crowd erupted with every goal, but each positional advantage was swiftly neutralized, as though fate had already woven the story of this game and ensured the clubs remained on equal footing.

Given the question: Process: - Iron is exposed to oxygen - Is exposed to air - A chemical reaction occurs - The iron starts to oxidize - The iron starts to rust. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is very high altitude happens, how will it affect MORE rust forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of being at a very high altitude can have an indirect effect on the rust formation process. At high altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, which results in lower oxygen concentrations. Since the rust formation process depends on the iron being exposed to oxygen, this reduction in oxygen concentration can slow down the rate of rust formation. Additionally, temperatures at high altitudes can be colder, which may also contribute to the slower rate of chemical reactions, including rust formation. However, high altitude environments can also have higher levels of humidity due to increased cloud cover. Increased humidity can speed up the rust formation process, as water is another essential component for rust to form.

Answer the following question: Information: - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris. - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"ásphaltos\\". - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills. - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971. - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams. - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m³ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM . With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001 the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system , however the results were n't as good as expected .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb Löffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\"). - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways. - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time.

Spielberg's DreamWorks bought the rights in 2010, originally intending John Madden to direct. The film was written by E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison and is co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg. The BFG is set to premiere out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2016, before its wide release in the US on July 1, 2016. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What film festival will first air 'The BFG'?","completion":"The BFG will first air at the Cannes Film Festival. Specifically, the movie is set to premiere out of competition at this event in May 2016. The Cannes Film Festival is a globally recognized event that's often a platform for films to gain international acclaim and recognition. This prestigious festival located in Cannes, France, and it's overseen by a board of directors and a jury that changes annually. The event seeks to draw attention to and raise the profile of films with the aim of contributing towards the development of cinema, boosting the film industry worldwide and celebrating cinema at an international level. After its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, 'The BFG' is then scheduled for wide release in the United States on July 1, 2016. This movie is a significant collaboration from entertainment powerhouses such as DreamWorks, Walt Disney Pictures, and Steven Spielberg. Notably, it's the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg, a distinguished filmmaker renowned for his impact on the film industry. DreamWorks bought the film rights to Roald Dahl's beloved children's story 'The BFG' in 2010, and although John Madden was initially intended to direct, Spielberg ultimately took on that role. The screenplay was written by Melissa Mathison, who also penned 'E.T.', one of Spielberg's most famous films. This fact carries the expectation that 'The BFG' will possess similar emotional depth and cinematic magic that has become Spielberg's storytelling signature. 'The BFG' tells the delightful story of a young London girl and the mysterious Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. Roald Dahl's novels, filled with imagination and adventure, have often been the basis for compelling cinema, and the combination of Dahl's storytelling with Spielberg's direction presents an exciting collaboration. Having Spielberg direct a celebrated children's story from Dahl in collaboration with a script from Mathison, with the backing of DreamWorks and Disney, is a testament to the rich storytelling and broad appeal that 'The BFG' offers. By premiering at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie gets an international platform to showcase this collaborative effort between these masters of storytelling. After its international début at Cannes, it will then be ready for a wide release in the U.S, where it's likely to be a considerable summer draw for viewers of all ages."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: SINGAPORE — What now? That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state. Rarely can any collection of a few hundred words adequately encapsulate the geo-political conundrum. It is... What are Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump? A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects C. not enough information D. He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him A:","completion":"Kim Jong Un's motivations in meeting with Trump are likely a combination of factors: A. He admires Trump and is genuinely willing to cut back or eliminate his nuclear program in return for a lifting of sanctions: This motivation could be partially true, as Kim Jong Un might understand the potential benefits that would come from easing tensions with the U.S. and lifting sanctions, which would help improve North Korea's struggling economy. B. He wants to appear as a competent statesman before the world and his subjects: This could be another significant factor in Kim's decision to meet with Trump. By showing the world and his people that he can hold talks with the U.S. president, Kim strengthens his position as a leader and demonstrates a certain level of political prowess. C: not enough information: While we may not have all the information needed to fully understand Kim's motivations, we do have enough to analyze his possible reasons for meeting with Trump based on the available information. D: He plans to take advantage of Trump's political naivete to deceive him: This motivation cannot be ruled out. As a skilled political strategist, Kim Jong Un might attempt to manipulate Trump in order to achieve his objectives while making it appear as if he's making concessions. It is important for the U.S. administration to remain cautious and vigilant during this delicate diplomatic process. In conclusion, Kim Jong Un's motivations for meeting with Trump likely include a combination of factors such as A, B, and D. It is essential to approach this situation carefully and with a clear understanding of North Korea's history and intentions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously... What is the key factor making the fish smaller now? A) The rising body temperatures.

In the premise, it is stated that the person made a decision to try something. On the other hand, the hypothesis says the person didn't dare try it. Step 3: Analyze logical consistency Since the hypothesis contradicts the premise, it means that the hypothesis is not logically consistent with the premise. The premise shows that a person decided to try something, indicating they did dare to try it, whereas the hypothesis claims that the person didn't dare to try it. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on our analysis, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I didn't dare try it.\\" is true.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale.

When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them. There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to break down the meanings of both statements and analyze their relationship. Premise: \\"The farmers tended their crops.\\" In this statement, we are given the information that the farmers are actively engaging in the process of managing and maintaining their crops. This could involve activities such as planting seeds, watering plants, fertilizing soil, weeding, and harvesting. The term \\"tended\\" indicates a level of care and attention given by the farmers towards their crops. Hypothesis: \\"The farmers took good care of their crops.\\" The hypothesis suggests that the farmers engaged in activities that promote the health and growth of their crops. It implies that the farmers' actions were positive and beneficial for the crops. The statement emphasizes the quality of care the farmers provided to their crops, using the descriptor \\"good.\\" Now that we have a clearer understanding of both statements, we can assess if the premise entails the hypothesis: In this case, the premise does entail the hypothesis. By stating that the farmers tended their crops, we understand that they were engaging in activities to manage and maintain the crops, which aligns with the idea of taking good care of them. The term \\"tended\\" carries a positive connotation, which supports the notion that the farmers were providing good care. However, it's important to note that the term \\"good\\" in the hypothesis might imply a certain level of quality in the farmers' actions that might not be necessarily covered by the premise. If ample evidence supports the fact that the farmers are indeed providing good care, then the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis will be stronger. In conclusion, the premise \\"The farmers tended their crops\\" entails the hypothesis \\"The farmers took good care of their crops\\" as both statements imply an active involvement in managing and maintaining the crops. However, the degree to which the care provided is considered \\"good\\" may require further evidence or clarification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: suppose less blood plasma available happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"The option B: less is the correct answer. When there is less blood plasma available, it means that there is a lower volume of blood circulating through the body. This can lead to reduced blood flow to the liver, which in turn would mean that the liver has to work less hard to perform its various functions. The liver is responsible for filtering blood from the digestive tract, producing bile, creating proteins for blood plasma, storing glucose as glycogen, converting ammonia to urea, and regulating blood clotting. With a reduced blood plasma volume, the liver will have fewer substances to process and convert, leading to a situation where it has to work \\"softer\\" or less hard than under normal conditions. However, it is important to note that a decrease in blood plasma could have negative effects on the overall functioning of the body.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

The base commander is an old friend, Lt.

Steve says he wants the job because he is too old for combat and the war will be won by pilots trained on bases like Thunderbird, but it is soon clear that he chose this base because his former girlfriend, Kay Saunders, lives nearby with her grandfather, retired Colonel Cyrus \\"Gramps\\" Saunders, also a close friend of Steve's.

In recent years, the countries of Eastern Europe have been told that they should privatise their banks, in other words, that they should subordinate them to Western European banks. Translate to Finnish","completion":"Viime vuosina Itä-Euroopan maihin on suositeltu pankkisektorin yksityistämistä eli muun muassa alisteisuutta Länsi-Euroopan pankkien kontrollille. Viime aikoina Itä-Euroopan maat ovat saaneet kuulla, että niiden tulisi yksityistää pankkinsa - toisin sanoen alistaa ne Länsi-Euroopan pankkien alaisuuteen. Tämän taustalla vaikuttava ajatus on se, että pankkisektorin yksityistäminen ja integroituminen osaksi Länsi-Euroopan rahoitusmarkkinoita auttaisivat Itä-Euroopan maita parantamaan taloudellista vakauttaan ja kasvattamaan vaurauttaan. Yksityistämistoimet ovat kuitenkin herättäneet myös kritiikkiä ja keskustelua sekä Itä-Euroopassa että laajemmassa kansainvälisessä yhteisössä. Kritiikin keskiössä ovat usein esimerkiksi paikallisten pankkien aseman heikkeneminen ja pääomasijoitusten mahdolliset riskit. Pankkitoiminnan yksityistäminen Itä-Euroopassa tarkoittaisi pääasiallisesti sen järjestämistä niin, että pankkitoimiala toimisi enemmän länsimaisilla ja yksityisillä markkinaperiaatteilla. Tämä tarkoittaa, että valtioiden rooli pankkitoiminnassa vähenisi ja pankkitoiminnan määräysvalta siirtyisi yksityisiin ja ulkomaisiin käsiin. Tällainen muutos voisi tuoda monia hyötyjä Itä-Euroopan maille, kuten uusia investointeja, teknologista osaamista ja kansainvälistä rahoitusmarkkinoiden osaamista. Länsi-Euroopan pankkien tuoma määräysvalta saattaisi myös tuoda mukanaan parannuksia pankkitoiminnan tehokkuuteen ja sääntelyyn. Toisaalta yksityistäminen voi synnyttää myös huolia ja riskejä. Esimerkiksi valtiollisten pankkien aseman heikkeneminen voi lisätä pankkitoiminnan kontrolloimatonta kilpailua ja keskittymistä. Ulkomaiset sijoittajat saattavat myös pyrkiä hyödyntämään paikallisten pankkien asemaa ja voivat vaikuttaa pankkisektorin vakavuuteen hinta- ja valuuttakurssien vaihteluilla. Lopulta Itä-Euroopan maiden tulee punnita yksityistämisen hyötyjä ja riskejä ja tehdä päätöksiä, jotka parhaiten palvelevat niiden omia taloudellisia, poliittisia ja sosiaalisia tarpeita. Pankkisektorin yksityistäminen ei ole yksiselitteisesti oikea tai väärä ratkaisu, vaan sen toteuttamisessa on tärkeää ottaa huomioon eri näkökulmia ja ehdottaa selkeitä menettelytapoja, joilla voidaan minimoida haitalliset vaikutukset ja maksimoida taloudellinen hyöty kunkin Itä-Euroopan maan tilanteen mukaan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Switzer began his career as a child actor in the mid-1930s appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as Alfalfa, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters. After leaving the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles owing to typecasting. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. Context: In early 1954, Switzer went on a blind date with Diantha (Dian) Collingwood, heiress of grain elevator empire Collingwood Grain. Collingwood had moved with her mother and sister to California in 1953 because her sister wanted to become an actress. Switzer and Collingwood got along well and married in Las Vegas three months later. In 1956, with his money running out and Diantha pregnant, his mother-in-law offered them a farm near Pretty Prairie, Kansas, west of Wichita. Their son, Justin Lance Collingwood Switzer (now Eldridge), was born that year. They divorced in 1957. In 1987, former Our Gang co-star George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland recalled a meeting with Switzer when they spoke about the farm: The last time I saw Carl was 1957. It was a tough time for me--and him. I was starting a tour of theme parks and county fairs in the Midwest. Carl had married this girl whose father owned a pretty good size farm near Wichita. When I came through town, he heard about it and called. He told me he was helping to run the farm, but he finally had to put a radio on the tractor while he was out there plowing. Knowing Carl, I knew that wasn't going to last. He may have come from Paris, Illinois, but he wasn't a farmer! We hadn't seen each other since we left the 'Gang.' So we had lunch. We talked about all the things you'd expect. And then I never saw him again. He looked pretty much the same. He was just Carl Switzer--kind of cocky, a little antsy--and I thought to myself he hadn't changed that much. He still talked big. He just grew up. In January 1958 Switzer was getting into his car in front of a bar in Studio City, when a bullet smashed through the window and struck him in the upper right arm. The gunman was never caught. That December he was arrested in Sequoia National Forest for cutting down 15 pine trees; he was sentenced to a year's probation and ordered to pay a 225 fine. Question: when did this tragedy happen?.

The Scot is the most successful manager in British football, and his status as the longest-serving one in United's history was cemented when the English Premier League champions renamed the biggest stand at Old Trafford in his honor. It is the first time in the ground's 101 years that a section has been named after an individual. Club officials have also commissioned an award-winning Scottish sculptor, Philip Jackson, to build a statue of the 69-year-old to be erected outside the stand's entrance next year. The unveiling of the newly christened Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was truly a significant event in the club's rich history, as it acknowledged the enduring impact that the iconic manager has had on both Manchester United and British football. As a testament to his remarkable achievements, the ceremony was attended by a host of dignitaries from the footballing world as well as Sir Alex's family and friends, who joined together to pay tribute to the man who defied expectations and transformed United into a global powerhouse. Ferguson's journey at the helm of Manchester United began in 1986 when he was appointed as the club's manager, following an impressive tenure at Aberdeen. Despite a challenging start, Sir Alex quickly silenced his critics by rebuilding the team and instilling a never-say-die attitude among its members. This culminated in unparalleled accomplishments that include an astounding 13 English Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League crowns, five FA Cups, and four League Cups, among numerous other domestic and international honors. It wasn't always a smooth ride, as he faced numerous adversities along the way, from internal conflicts to intense rivalry with other top English clubs. However, Ferguson's unwavering dedication to the club and his relentless pursuit of excellence set him apart, and he became synonymous with the Red Devils' rise to the zenith of European football. Under his stewardship, the club also nurtured and developed several generations of world-class talents such as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney, further cementing his reputation as a true football visionary. The anniversary celebration was, in many ways, a microcosm of Ferguson's tenure, as it showcased both the joys and challenges that have marked his extraordinary career. The festivities were heightened by the electrifying atmosphere at the packed Old Trafford stadium, which reverberated with chants and songs in honor of the living legend. The occasion, however, was not without some nervous moments, as the Red Devils' on-field performance seemed to wobble under the sheer weight of expectations. Nevertheless, much like countless times before, Ferguson's side ultimately prevailed, underlining the indelible spirit that he has instilled in his players and the organization as a whole. And as the final whistle blew, emotions, memories, and tributes poured forth once more, reflecting on the lasting legacy of a man who has steadfastly given his all for the love of the beautiful game and etched his name in the annals of football history. In conclusion, Sir Alex Ferguson's 25th anniversary celebration at Manchester United was a fitting blend of highs and lows, reflecting the immense challenges he faced and the incredible success he achieved as the club's manager. As a sign of deep appreciation and respect for his contributions, the christening of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and the commissioning of a statue in his honor are emblematic of the enduring bond between the legendary manager and the club he has helped define over the past quarter-century."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all. What does a dog communicate with its tail? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"A dog's tail is an important tool for communication, both with other dogs and with humans. By observing the position, movement, and speed of a dog's tail, one can gain insight into its emotions, intentions, and overall demeanor. Here is a breakdown of the various ways a dog communicates using its tail: 1. Tail position: - A high tail often signifies a dog that is confident, assertive or excited. This can, at times, be a sign of aggression or dominance. - A tail held in its natural position (varying depending on the breed) signals that the dog is relaxed and comfortable. - A low tail, tucked between the legs, indicates fear, submissiveness, or anxiety. 2. Tail wagging: - A slow wag, especially with the tail held low or in its natural position, usually means the dog is uncertain, cautious, or slightly anxious. - A rapid and wide wag, with the tail held at the dog's natural level, signals a happy and excited dog, often seeking attention, play, or affection from others. - A fast, stiff wag, particularly with a high tail, may signify aggression, tension, or alertness to a potential threat. 3. The direction of wagging: - Some studies suggest that a wag that leans more predominantly to the dog's right side indicates a positive emotion or encounter, such as happiness, excitement, or friendliness. - Conversely, a wag that leans more to the dog's left side can suggest negative emotions or experiences, such as wariness, fear, or suspicion. 4. Tail movement speed: - The faster the tail is wagging, the more heightened the dog's emotional state, be it positive or negative. 5. Breed-specific tail considerations: - As mentioned earlier, certain dog breeds have unique tail shapes that can influence the way they communicate with their tails. For example, a Greyhound's natural tail position when relaxed is low and close to its hind legs, while an Akita's natural tail position consists of a curl over its back. It is essential to consider the dog's tail movement and position in conjunction with other body language cues, such as ear position, facial expressions, and overall posture, to better understand the dog's emotional state and intentions. By observing these non-verbal signals, one can form a holistic understanding of a dog's communication and respond appropriately in various situations."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This product was a wonderful tool to use with children who love the game Jenga.

Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel stash and increase their coins at the Cool World bank . Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel storage space and increase their coins at the Cool World Bank .","completion":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia are similar, they do not convey the same meaning entirely. The subtle differences between them lie in the terms \\"nickel stash\\" and \\"nickel storage space\\" as well as in capitalization of \\"Cool World bank\\" versus \\"Cool World Bank.\\" Here is a comparison of both sentences and how they differ in meaning: 1. \\"Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel stash and increase their coins at the Cool World bank.\\" This sentence focuses on explaining the action of players visiting Las Vegas to store their \\"nickel stash.\\" Here, the term \\"stash\\" refers to a collection or a group of nickels that players have accumulated. The sentence implies that storing their nickels at the \\"Cool World bank\\" would also enable players to increase their number of coins. It's important to note that the term \\"bank\\" is not capitalized in this sentence, which could suggest the \\"Cool World bank\\" is a general financial institution within the game environment and not necessarily an official name. 2. \\"Players can visit Las Vegas to store their nickel storage space and increase their coins at the Cool World Bank.\\" In contrast to the first sentence, this version refers to \\"nickel storage space\\" instead of \\"nickel stash.\\" The term \\"storage space\\" might suggest a physical location or a capacity limit for storing nickels. This change makes the sentence slightly more ambiguous and creates confusion about whether players are storing their nickels or increasing the storage capacity for nickels. Furthermore, this sentence includes a capitalized \\"Bank,\\" implying that the \\"Cool World Bank\\" is an official name or a specific institution within the game setting. Though the primary action remains the same—players visiting Las Vegas to increase their coins—using \\"Cool World Bank\\" implies that it is a specific, named location. In summary, while both sentences convey the idea that players are visiting Las Vegas to store their nickels and increase their coins, the first sentence highlights the action of storing a collection of nickels, whereas the second sentence is more ambiguous about whether it is the nickels or their storage capacity that is being stored. Additionally, the capitalization difference implies a more specific location in the second sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides - The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere - The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide - The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid - The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is \\"Burning of coal\\": 1. Burning of coal: When coal is burned in industries or power plants, it releases a large amount of heat energy, which is used to generate electricity or to power various industrial processes. During combustion, the sulfur present in the coal is exposed to oxygen. 2. Sulfur in the coal combines with oxygen to form sulfur oxides: As the coal burns, the sulfur atoms present in the fuel react with oxygen to form sulfur oxides, predominantly sulfur dioxide (SO2). 3. The sulfur oxides are released into the atmosphere: The sulfur oxides created during combustion are released into the atmosphere as part of the flue gas emissions from power plants and industrial facilities. 4. The sulfides combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to form sulfur trioxide: Once in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide can undergo a series of chemical reactions with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide (SO3). 5. The sulfur trioxide reacts with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid, a very strong acid: The sulfur trioxide will then react with water vapor present in the atmosphere to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a highly corrosive and strong acid. 6. The sulfuric acid makes the rain acidic: The resulting sulfuric acid becomes part of the atmospheric moisture, which falls as acid rain when precipitation occurs. Acid rain can have harmful effects on the environment, including causing damage to forests, water ecosystems, and buildings or monuments made from materials such as limestone and marble."},{"prompt":"Question: what is a Four Lokos?

Riots were sparked across the Islamic world in September after a 14-minute trailer for the \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video was released on YouTube. Troops are now on heightened alert to the risk of another round of protests because a derivative film called \\"The Innocent Prophet\\" is slated to be released on Friday. The new footage created by an ex- Muslim originally from Pakistan has already inflamed tensions in his former home country ahead of its release. Coalition forces are prepared for extreme reactions to the provocative video that could hamper their efforts in neighbouring Afghanistan, which is already a tinder box of religious sensitivities. Defence forces are warned to be wary of inadvertently offending locals as part of their preparations for deployment to the main Australian base in Uruzgan province or other centres of Kabul and Kandahar. Cultural sensitivity training is a standard element of soldiers' pre-deployment training in Australia. But the key points are drilled into all military and civilian personnel going to work in Afghanistan in another intensive four day program at the Al Minhad Air Base outside Dubai. The training includes appropriate ways to handle and store the Koran, which is generally wrapped in a cloth and only opened after the reader has ritually cleansed themselves. This preparation has taken on extra urgency in the aftermath of an increase in insider attacks against Coalition forces. Retribution for perceived slights on Islam are thought to be one possible trigger for these turncoat attacks, which claimed three out of the seven Diggers' lives lost in Afghanistan this year. Coalition forces are wary of violent reactions from Afghans who are upset by breaches of religious protocol. Days of rioting ensued after Coalition soldiers burned copies of the Koran when they were disposing of old books at the Bagram Air Base near Kabul last February. US President Barack Obama and the chief of NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, both issued televised apologies in a bid to quell the outcry, which insurgents have used as justification for attacks. The Australians' training also covers emergency care of battle casualties, shooting practice and the latest intelligence on the other big killer of troops - improvised explosive devices. Troops are briefed on the latest threats from explosives, practice travelling through mine fields and detecting suicide bombers. Simulated rescue missions of injured people from buildings and vehicles while under fire are used to prepare troops for the worst case scenarios they could encounter during their deployment.

Some animals are living in big forests. And some animals are living with man. Animals are very important to man. For example, people can train the elephants to do some heavy work. And they can also train the dogs to look after the house. A police dog is clever. It can help people in danger. And it can also help the policeman to catch the thieves or murderers. The children like dogs very much. Everyone knows sheep and pigs very well. Man eats their meat almost every day. People can make coasts and shoes with their skins. From cows, we can get milk. It's good for our health. And horses can take us to other places. In some places, horses and camels are instead of car and buses. It's clear that man can't live comfortably without these animals.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Information: - Apollyon Sun were an industrial metal band formed by singer/guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer and guitarist Erol Unala in early 1995, after the termination of Celtic Frost, Fischer's prior group. The group was unofficially dissolved in 2001 when Fischer invited Erol Unala to contribute to the reformation of Celtic Frost. Their name is taken from the Celtic Frost demo \\"Under Apollyon's Sun\\". - Black Sabbath are an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war. - Necrophilia, also called thanatophilia, is a sexual attraction or sexual act involving corpses. The attraction is classified as a paraphilia by the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\" (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. The term was coined by the Belgian alienist Joseph Guislain, who first used it in a lecture in 1850. It derives from the Greek words \\"\\" (\\"nekros\\"; \\"dead\\") and \\"\\" (\\"philia\\"; \\"love\\"). - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration perpetrated against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term \\"rape\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"sexual assault.\\" - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Cannibalism is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices cannibalism is called a cannibal. The expression \\"cannibalism\\" has been extended into zoology to mean one individual of a species consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food, including sexual cannibalism. - Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and bass guitarist Steven Severin. Initially associated with the English punk rock scene, the band rapidly evolved to create \\"a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation\\". \\"The Times\\" cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as \\"one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era\\". - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture. - Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1969. The band has sold close to 50 million albums to date. MTV ranked them the second greatest metal band of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferently produced records, repeated changes of drummer and a lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album \\"British Steel\\", which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. In 1989, they were named as defendants in an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging that subliminal messages on the song \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" had caused the suicide attempts of two young men. - Thomas Gabriel Fischer ( born 19 July 1963 ) , earlier known by his stage name of Tom G. Warrior , is a Swiss metal musician . He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the death metal style of singing , which resembles guttural growling . He led the groups Hellhammer and Celtic Frost , and today is the frontman of the band Triptykon . - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - Slasher films are a subgenre of horror films, typically involving a violent psychopath stalking and murdering several people, usually with bladed tools. Although the term \\"slasher\\" is sometimes used informally as a generic term for any horror movie involving murder, analysts of the genre cite an established set of characteristics which set these films apart from other horror subgenres, such as splatter films and psychological horror films. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Atonality in its broadest sense is music that lacks a tonal center, or key. \\"Atonality\\", in this sense, usually describes compositions written from about 1908 to the present day where a hierarchy of pitches focusing on a single, central tone is not used, and the notes of the chromatic scale function independently of one another . More narrowly, the term \\"atonality\\" describes music that does not conform to the system of tonal hierarchies that characterized classical European music between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries . \\"The repertory of atonal music is characterized by the occurrence of pitches in novel combinations, as well as by the occurrence of familiar pitch combinations in unfamiliar environments\\" . - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - A triptych (; from the Greek adjective \\"\\" \\"\\"triptukhon\\"\\" (\\"three-fold\\"), from \\"tri\\", i.e., \\"three\\" and \\"ptysso\\", i.e., \\"to fold\\" or \\"ptyx\\", i.e., \\"fold\\") is a work of art (usually a panel painting) that is divided into three sections, or three carved panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of polyptych, the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for pendant jewelry. - Dissection (from Latin ' \\"to cut to pieces\\"; also called anatomization), is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. It is carried out by or demonstrated to biology and anatomy students in high school and medical school. Less advanced courses typically focus on smaller subjects, such as small formaldehyde-preserved animals, while the more advanced courses normally use cadavers. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab. - Celtic Frost was a Swiss extreme metal band from Zürich. They are known for their heavy influence on the extreme metal genres. Formed in 1981 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. The band was inspired by heavy metal groups such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom, but also by gothic rock acts like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Christian Death, and by the hardcore punk group Discharge. - Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. \\"Nature\\" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena. - Lovecraftian horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that emphasizes the cosmic horror of the unknown (and in some cases, unknowable) more than gore or other elements of shock, though these may still be present. It is named after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890 1937). - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body. - Hellhammer was a Swiss extreme metal band from Nurensdorf, active during 19811984. They are regarded as a key influence on black metal, and one of the founders of death metal. In June 1984, Hellhammer became Celtic Frost. - Triptykon is a musical project of Thomas Gabriel Fischer, founding member of the pioneering heavy metal bands Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Apollyon Sun. Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in May 2008 and shortly afterwards revealed his new project would be entitled Triptykon. The name of the band is the Greek word for \\"triptych\\", and is aimed at stating that Triptykon is founding member Thomas Gabriel Fischer's third project after Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The band logo is inspired by a writing pattern used in Weimar Republic. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams. They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements. - A blast beat is a drum beat that originated in hardcore punk and grindcore, and is often associated with extreme metal and more recently black metal and thrash. It is utilised by many different styles of metal. In Adam MacGregor's definition, \\"the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the bass drum, snare, and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.\\" Blast beats have been described as, \\"maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence\\". - Satanism is a group of ideological and philosophical beliefs based on the character of Satan. Contemporary religious practice of Satanism began with the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966, although a few historical precedents exist. Prior to the public practice, Satanism existed primarily as an accusation by various Christian groups toward perceived ideological opponents, rather than a self-identity. Satanism, and the concept of Satan, has also been used by artists and entertainers for symbolic expression. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. What is the relationship between 'thomas gabriel fischer' and 'zürich'?

While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Budapest is the capital and most populous city of Hungary, one of the largest cities in the European Union and sometimes described as the primate city of Hungary.

Here is a premise: \\"A four person band is playing in a church.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"Nobody is playing.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise given is \\"A four-person band is playing in a church.\\" This statement suggests that there is indeed a band consisting of four individuals, and they are performing in a church setting. Consequently, we can infer that there is some form of music being played, as the information revolves around a band performing, and bands are typically associated with playing music. On the other hand, the hypothesis provided is \\"Nobody is playing.\\" This assumption directly contradicts the premise, as it claims that nobody is engaged in musical performance. Since the hypothesis opposes the premise, the information from the premise indicates that the hypothesis is not true. The inherent contradiction makes it impossible to support the hypothesis by using the premise as evidence. In conclusion, the premise \\"A four-person band is playing in a church\\" contradicts the hypothesis \\"Nobody is playing,\\" implying that the hypothesis is false based on the information given in the premise.

Premise: \\"The Astronomer sighed and said, \\"There are the boys!\\" \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there.\\"?","completion":"The given premise, in which the Astronomer sighs and says \\"There are the boys!\\", suggests that the boys were in the presence of the Astronomer, or at least within his visual range. However, the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" can be evaluated based on various factors that might affect its likelihood of being accurate or imprecise when compared to the given premise. Firstly, it is important to consider the context in which the given premise and hypothesis are placed. The Astronomer's sigh could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as relief, frustration, disappointment, or admiration, depending on the situation and the intentions involved. If the boys were the topic of their conversation or thoughts, the presence of the boys can confirm their position and possibly lend some support to the hypothesis. With the given information, it is possible that the Astronomer's exclamation signifies an acknowledgment of the boys' location, which could be described by the term \\"over there.\\" This might imply a physical distance between the boys and the speaker, but \\"over there\\" is a subjective term and depends on the perspective of the speaker. In this sense, \\"over there\\" could mean that the boys are nearby or far away; therefore, it is not completely certain that the premise entails the hypothesis. Furthermore, the Astronomer's statement doesn't specify the actual direction or position of the boys. Without specific details on the location of the boys in relation to the Astronomer, it is impossible to be certain that the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" clearly follows or contradicts the premise. In conclusion, given the premise \\"The Astronomer sighed and said, 'There are the boys!\\", it is possible that it supports the hypothesis \\"The boys were over there\\" when considering the Astronomer's acknowledgment of their location. However, due to the vague nature of the term \\"over there\\" and the lack of details regarding the boys' actual position in relation to the speaker, the premise doesn't definitely entail the hypothesis. We would require more contextual information and details of their location to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis within the premise's framework."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Refusal: Stephanie Kercher, pictured in 2011, has said her family are not interested in what Amanda Knox has to say in her book. It is one of the most keenly anticipated books of the decade. But Amanda Knox’s million-dollar memoir isn’t to everyone’s taste - the Kercher family have made it clear that they at least will not be reading it. ‘We're not interested in this book, just like we weren't interested in the others about the case, and we won't read it,' Meredith’s sister Stephanie Kercher said, after its US release yesterday. She added: ‘Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox served four years in an Italian jail for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Perugia. She and former boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito were freed on appeal in 2011, but last month Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial. Her memoir Waiting to be Heard, for which Knox was reportedly paid a 2 million pound advance, was published today in the US although plans to sell it in the UK were shelved after its publisher Harper Collins took legal advice. While a new trial is expected to take place by the summer in Florence, US authorities could invoke the principle of double-jeopardy, arguing that a person cannot be convicted of the same offence twice, and so refuse to extradite Knox back to Italy. Stephanie Kercher, the sister of the victim, released a statement in Italian through the family's lawyers Francesco Maresca and Serena Perna in Italy late on Tuesday after excerpts of Miss Knox's first US TV interview were released to publicise the release of her book, Waiting to Be Heard. She also emphasised that Miss Knox could be found guilty in the new trial. She said: ‘The Italian legal system still has an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new court hearing. The sentence can still be overturned. ‘I have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life. Her story: In pre-interviews ahead of the release of 'Waiting to be Heard', Amanda Knox has said she wants the Kercher family top read her memoirs. Killed: Knox spent four years in jail for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, in Perugia, Italy, November 2007. ‘Something Meredith will never have and something we can never share with her. Meredith is the victim in this tragic case.’ Knox had earlier expressed the desire that Meredith’s parents would read the book, something she hoped would give her some ‘closure’. ‘The ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me Meredith's grave,' she told USA Today. ‘I wasn't allowed to grieve, either, and that would mean a lot to me’. ‘I really want to go see her grave,\\" repeated Miss Knox, who spent four years in prison before being acquitted. 'And right now I don't feel I have the right to without her family's permission.’ Knox likened her ordeal to being forced to crawl through a 'field of barbed wire' to reach the 'same side' as the Kerchers. In another interview, she told ABC News that she wrote the book to respond in full to accusations that meant ‘for all intents and purposes I was a murderer’. ‘I want the truth to come out. I'd like to be reconsidered as a person,' she said. 'I was in the courtroom when they were calling me a devil. ‘It's one thing to be called certain things in the media, but it's another to be sitting in a courtroom, fighting for your life, while people are calling you a devil.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Help as much as you can. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What policy serves to protect children according to the church? Context: Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.

Given the question \\"How would Taylor feel afterwards?\\", is \\"like a failure\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"like a failure\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe how Taylor might feel after missing an important exam due to oversleeping. However, this is a shorthand interpretation, and to better understand Taylor's emotions, it would be helpful to explore the issue more comprehensively, taking into consideration various emotional, psychological, and social factors. First, let's consider the emotional aspects. Missing an important exam due to oversleeping could elicit a range of emotions in Taylor. These emotions might include: 1. Frustration: Taylor might feel frustrated with themselves for not being able to manage their sleep habits and schedule well enough to be awake and prepared for the exam. 2. Sadness: Taylor may experience sadness as they realize the potential consequences of missing the exam, such as a lower grade or poor academic performance. 3. Anxiety: Taylor could feel anxious about how this event will impact their future, whether it concerns their academic progress, career opportunities, or personal goals. 4. Disappointment: Taylor might be disappointed in themselves for not living up to their own expectations or the expectations of others (e.g., teachers, parents, friends). 5. Guilt: Taylor may feel guilty for failing to meet their responsibilities and for potentially letting down others who have invested time and effort in supporting their education. Considering the psychological aspects, Taylor's self-perception could be affected by this incident. They might: 1. Experience reduced self-esteem: Taylor could view themselves as less capable or worthy due to their perceived failure. 2. Develop a negative self-schema: Taylor might start to see themselves as someone who fails frequently, leading to a pessimistic outlook on their abilities. 3. Engage in self-blame: Taylor may attribute the event to internal causes, such as personal flaws, rather than external factors like poor time management or an unpredictable sleep schedule. 4. Feel a loss of control: Taylor could perceive their sleep habits as something they are powerless to change, leading to a sense of helplessness. Finally, let's examine the potential social consequences that might also influence Taylor's emotions: 1. Fear of judgment: Taylor may worry about being judged or stigmatized by their peers, teachers, or family members for missing the exam. 2. Social isolation: Taylor might feel isolated from friends or classmates who successfully completed the exam, leading to further feelings of failure or inadequacy. 3. Damaged reputation: Taylor could be concerned about how this event might impact their relationships and reputation within their social and academic circles. In conclusion, although \\"like a failure\\" can be considered a valid answer to describe Taylor's feelings after missing an important exam due to oversleeping, it is important to recognize that their emotional experience could be more complex and multifaceted. To truly understand their emotions, it is essential to consider the various emotional, psychological, and social factors contributing to Taylor's reaction to the incident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now this is perhaps the first generation of American youngsters who have never been close by during of the birth a baby and have never experienced the death of a family member. Nowadays when people grow old, we often send them to nursing homes. When they get sick, we send them to a hospital, where children are forbidden to visit terminally in patients-- even when those patients are their parents. This deprives the dying patient of family members during the last few days of his life and it deprives the children of an experience of death, which is an important learning experience. Some of my colleagues and I once interviewed and followed about 500 terminally in order to find out what they could teach us and how we could be of more benefit, not just to them but to the members of their families as well. We were most impressed by the fact that even those patients who were not told of their serious illness were quite aware of its potential outcome. It is important for family members, and doctors and nurses to understand these patients' communication in order to truly understand their needs, fears and fantasies . Most of our patients welcomed another human being with whom they could talk openly, honestly, and frankly about their trouble. Many of them shared with us their great need to be informed, to be kept up - to - date on their medical condition and to be told when the end was near.

For example, one sentence says \\"what is happening here,\\" while the other does not include this phrase. Another distinction is the use of \\"this action\\" in contrast to \\"these actions,\\" but this difference does not change the meaning significantly. The second part of both sentences focuses on people trying to find fresh reasons to state why the actions were not the right thing to do. One sentence uses \\"to say this wasn't the right thing to do\\" while the other has \\"why it was not the right thing to do.\\" Still, this difference in phrasing does not alter the primary message of the sentences. Overall, although the two sentences may demonstrate slight variations in their expression, their core meaning is the same, and therefore, I would rate them as being highly similar with a score of 5 on the scale of 0 to 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Young accusers to be revealed at Sandusky sex abuse trial STATE COLLEGE, Pa. – The young men who accuse former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky of molesting them have been allowed to remain anonymous through months of intense news coverage and water-cooler conversation about the scandal. When they take the witness stand in a packed Pennsylvania courtroom as early as next week, the alleged victims will be forced to state their names for the record -- traumatizing them all over again, their lawyers and victims' advocates argue, especially given the very real possibility their identities will become common knowledge via social media and the wider Internet. Most traditional media organizations, including The Associated Press, have longstanding policies against using the names of alleged victims of sexual assault, viewing the crime as so intensely personal and the potential effect of public disclosure so traumatic for the accuser that withholding the identity outweighs the public's right to know. But in this anything-goes age of social media and citizen journalists, when anyone with a smartphone can tweet or blog, old media standards may no longer make much difference. Anyone lucky enough to grab one of the 85 courtroom seats reserved for the public could sit in for the day, jot down some of the accusers' names, leave and disseminate them to the world. \\"Most of us want to have some control over who we share intimate details of our lives with,\\" said Karen Baker, director of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. \\"To have that out there on the Internet, you've totally lost control, and it's a scary thing.\\" Sandusky, 68, faces 52 counts accusing him of sexually abusing 10 boys over a span of 15 years. Prosecutors say the retired coach befriended boys he met through The Second Mile, the charity he founded for youngsters in 1977, then attacked them, in some cases in his home or inside university athletic facilities. He has denied the allegations. Most of the accusers are now in their 20s. Up to now, they have been identified in court papers only as \\"Victim 1,\\" \\"Victim 2\\" and so on. Five of the eight alleged victims who could be called to the stand asked Judge John Cleland for permission to testify under pseudonyms, saying through their lawyers that exposing their names would subject them to shame, ridicule and harassment. An attorney for the accuser known as Victim 4 submitted an affidavit from his psychologist that said public disclosure could trigger symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and interfere with the young man's treatment and recovery. And a coalition of advocacy groups argued that removing the cloak of anonymity would have a chilling effect on victims' willingness to report abuse. Most childhood sexual abuse already goes unreported because young victims fear they will be ridiculed or disbelieved, the groups noted in a brief submitted to the judge. But the judge said there is no authority in Pennsylvania law to allow the alleged victims to remain anonymous. While state law shields the identities of child victims of sexual assault, it affords no explicit protection to adult accusers even if the abuse took place when they were children. Cleland also said there is a public policy consideration at stake. \\"Courts are not customarily in the business of withholding information,\\" he wrote. \\"Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully.\\" With rare exception, Cleland said, all citizens have a duty to testify publicly, \\"no matter how personally unpleasant.\\" In the wake of that ruling, victims' organizations pleaded with the public and the media Thursday to exercise restraint. \\"Victims everywhere should know that their privacy will be respected when they come forward to reveal intimate details of sexual abuse. They participate in the criminal justice process in an effort to do the right thing and testify about their experiences; they should not have to worry about being publicly targeted when doing so,\\" said Baker's group and others said in a statement. John Giugliano, a clinical social worker and associate professor at Widener University, said victims of childhood sexual abuse can suffer anew when their names are publicized because the most humiliating episode of their lives is suddenly open to public inspection and judgment. Common symptoms of abuse -- depression, anxiety, substance abuse, difficulty connecting with others -- can flare up or become more severe, he said. Beth Docherty, who was 15 when her music teacher raped her, said she was grateful her name wasn't released. Even with the court's protection, though, a newspaper account contained just enough detail about her identity -- that she played flute -- that it became known within her school. She said the teacher's supporters sent her hate mail and broke her windows. Docherty, now 43 and president of the board of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, sees parallels with the Sandusky case. Just as she was blamed for reporting her attacker, Docherty said, some Penn State fans have blamed the accusers for football coach Joe Paterno's firing last fall, just months before his death from cancer. \\"You've gone through this horrible thing, and you have people who don't know you blaming you, saying you caused this icon to be brought down. It stays with you. It affects you for a long time,\\" she said. \\"Having that identity kept from the public is a little bit of a comfort, so I feel for them. It's going to be really traumatic, and I give them a lot of credit to still go through with it and not crush and crumble under all the pressure.\\" If the victims' names do become public knowledge during trial, it probably won't be the result of reporting by the traditional media. \\"We have a firm and longstanding policy not to publish the names of victims of sexual crimes without their consent,\\" Lawrence Beaupre, executive editor of Times-Shamrock Communications, said in an email. The media conglomerate publishes The Times-Tribune in Scranton and several other newspapers and has sent a reporter to the trial. More than 80 media outlets have been credentialed to cover the trial, from broadcast networks and major newspapers to Internet portals, independent journalists and tiny online news operations, some of which told AP that they, too, plan to withhold the accusers' names. At the same time, the issue of whether to shield victims of sex crimes from exposure has launched countless newsroom arguments. Is it fair to the alleged perpetrators to allow accusers to remain anonymous, especially in cases where the charge has turned out to be false? Is such a policy inadvertently perpetuating the notion that victims of sexual abuse have something to be ashamed about? The Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics does not include a blanket prohibition on using the names of sexual abuse victims; it merely advises news organizations to \\"be cautious\\" about identifying them. Kevin Z. Smith, SPJ's past president and chairman of its ethics committee, said it is his personal belief that media organizations should reconsider their stand against naming. \\"We shouldn't stigmatize victims of sexual assault,\\" he said. \\"I don't think as a society we do ourselves a favor by ostracizing these people, and I don't think the press does a helpful job by perpetuating that by saying, \`We are going to protect you.\\"' Even Giugliano, the social worker, said there can be a benefit to testifying in open court. Some victims find it liberating to confront their abuser, he said. \\"There can be a very positive effect through all of this, a release of shame, having their voice heard and their day in court, a feeling of being vindicated,\\" Giugliano said. \\"Those things can have a very positive, empowering effect.\\" But he said that decision should be left to the individual and his therapist. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A trial is taking place where some young men are accusing a former football coach, Jerry Sandusky, of sexually abusing them when they were younger.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions. After reading the above, is \\"European 1498\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In what town and in what year was Durer born?\\"? Options: --no --yes","completion":"--no The text states that Durer was born in Nuremberg in 1471, not \\"European 1498.\\" Durer is indeed a renowned European artist, and 1498 is a significant year as it's when he created the \\"Apocalypse\\" series of woodcuts, but these details don't pertain to the city and year of his birth. The information provided shows Durer's broad influence across Europe and the significant events and creations throughout his lifetime, from the start of his career in his twenties with high-quality woodcut prints to his collaborations with major Italian artists of his time. His prolific body of work includes various techniques such as engravings, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours, and books, with a preference for engraving in his latter years. His well-known engravings include pieces like \\"The Knight, Death, and the Devil\\" (1513), \\"Saint Jerome in his Study\\" (1514), and \\"Melencolia I\\" (1514). Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists made him an important figure in the Northern Renaissance. His theoretical treatises, which involve the principles of mathematics, perspective, and ideal proportions, also reinforce his significant contribution to the arts. Despite all his achievements, however, the correct answer remains that he was born in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1471.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Dam building prevents life-threatening situations.","completion":"While the given paragraph does not specifically address the issue of dam building preventing life-threatening situations, it does emphasize the importance of tailoring dam construction to the unique requirements of each individual project, taking into consideration factors such as geophysical conditions, social uncertainty, management organizations, operational complexities, and logistics. These considerations can indirectly contribute to reducing or preventing life-threatening situations. However, to determine the truth of the statement \\"Dam building prevents life-threatening situations,\\" we must examine the broader context and objectives of dam construction and their potential impact on public safety and environmental conditions. Dams serve several vital purposes, including flood control, water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation. These functions can help mitigate natural disasters, such as floods, or contribute to more consistent water supply and energy production, which can improve living conditions for populations in surrounding areas. In this sense, dam building may indeed help prevent life-threatening situations resulting from water-related disasters or resource shortages. However, dams can also pose risks and create potentially life-threatening situations if not properly designed, constructed, and maintained. Structural failures, such as dam breaches, can lead to devastating downstream flooding, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Additionally, dams can significantly impact river ecosystems and the people who rely on those ecosystems for their livelihoods, leading to potential societal and environmental repercussions. In conclusion, while it is not possible to definitively conclude that dam building universally prevents life-threatening situations based on the information provided in the paragraph, dam construction can contribute to mitigating certain risks when executed and managed appropriately. The level of public safety and environmental protection offered by a dam largely hinges on the careful consideration of factors mentioned in the paragraph and the implementation of robust engineering, management, and maintenance practices."},{"prompt":"Q:The answer to the question: Which types of boards have four holes where the binding threads were laced through? is inside the article: The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques.

Randy drew a simple diamond shape in the dirt to help Michael understand. \\"This is the baseball field,\\" he said. \\"There are four bases – first base, second base, third base, and home plate – where we run to when we hit the ball.\\" Randy showed Michael how to stand and hold the bat. \\"Bend your knees a little, and hold the bat like you're about to give it a great big hug,\\" Randy instructed. Michael followed along, trying to copy his friend's movements. Then, Randy taught Michael how to throw the ball. \\"Hold it with your fingers like this,\\" he said, demonstrating how to grip the ball. \\"Then, wind up your arm, and let it fly through the air like a soaring bird.\\" After practicing for a while, Randy and Michael were ready to play a simple game of baseball. They took turns being the batter and the pitcher, trying to hit the ball and catch it. They laughed as they ran around the bases, sometimes tripping over their own feet. As the sun began to set, Randy and Michael were both sweaty, giggly, and tired. But they had a wonderful time learning how to play baseball. Michael couldn't wait to play again soon. And so, Randy's love for baseball spread to his friend Michael. Now they shared a special bond as they played the game together, making memories and having lots of fun under the sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Annoying since it's finished jailbreaking...","completion":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet, we need to break it down into its different components and analyze the emotions being expressed by the user. The tweet says, \\"Cydia's dying on me. Annoying since it's finished jailbreaking...\\" First, let's understand the context of the tweet. Cydia is a third-party app platform available for iPhones and other Apple devices that have been jailbroken, which means breaking the limitations set by the manufacturer by removing software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, thus allowing the user to install unofficial apps and tweaks. In this tweet, the user is expressing frustration regarding an issue they're having with Cydia. Now, let's look at the sentiment behind each part of the tweet: 1. \\"Cydia's dying on me\\": The user is experiencing some form of malfunction or instability with the Cydia app. The term \\"dying\\" often denotes a negative emotion, which in this context suggests that the user is not satisfied with the performance of the app. This statement portrays a negative sentiment. 2. \\"Annoying\\": The use of the word \\"annoying\\" directly shows that the user is experiencing irritation or frustration due to the problem they're facing with Cydia. This reveals that the user's sentiment is of discontent and dissatisfaction. 3. \\"since it's finished jailbreaking\\": This part of the tweet provides the context for the user's frustration. The user has already gone through the jailbreaking process, which presumably was successful, but now, they are being hindered by this issue with the Cydia app. This further emphasizes the negative sentiment of the tweet, where the user feels disappointment in not being able to continue with their desired tasks after completing the jailbreak. In summary, the overall sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative. The user is expressing multiple emotions like frustration, dissatisfaction, irritation, and disappointment, all of which stem from the issues they are encountering with Cydia after completing the jailbreaking process. The user's experience, as portrayed in this tweet, is clearly not what they had expected or hoped for after jailbreaking their device."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The beach near our house is a lot better than the shore near my mom's place, because the","completion":"sand is finer and the water is clearer. Additionally, there are a number of factors that contribute to why I prefer our local beach over the other one. Step 1: I will elaborate on the main reasons. The first reason is primarily ecological. Due to the absence of any nearby factories or pollution sources, the beach near our house boasts pristine waters, ideal for swimming and aquatic activities. On the other hand, the shore near my mom's place tends to have a murkier appearance, making it less appealing for such endeavors. Step 2: I will compare the facilities and amenities. Moreover, our local beach provides a variety of amenities and facilities, such as public restrooms, showers, and well-maintained picnic areas. This ensures that the experience is both pleasant and convenient for visitors. Conversely, the shoreline near my mom's house often lacks adequate infrastructure, which may result in a less enjoyable visit for beachgoers. Step 3: I will describe the beach environment and crowd. Another aspect that sets our beach apart is its more peaceful and relaxing vibe. The laid-back atmosphere, coupled with the gentle sound of waves and a generally less crowded environment, allows for a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. My mom's coastal area, however, is often congested with tourists and locals, which can make it chaotic and noisy. Step 4: I will talk about the recreational opportunities. Furthermore, the beach near our house offers a multitude of recreational activities, including surfing, beach volleyball, and leisurely walks along the shoreline. These options cater to a wide range of interests and skill levels, ensuring that everyone can participate and have fun. Regrettably, the shore near my mom's place has limited choices for entertainment, thus reducing its overall appeal. Step 5: I will conclude by summarizing the main points. In conclusion, the beach near our house is hands down a superior choice when compared to the shore near my mom's place. The remarkable cleanliness, well-maintained facilities, serene atmosphere, and diverse range of recreational activities all contribute to making our local beach a more desirable destination for relaxation and enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\" you should practice how to _ .
