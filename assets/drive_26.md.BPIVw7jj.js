What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, and served time in a remand centre? from the following article ? Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon later observed, \\"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration. That's what it all meant to Sid.\\" Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from the other members of the band. Lydon later wrote, \\"We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely...

FBI investigating 'suspicious' death aboard Royal Caribbean cruise BALTIMORE – An FBI spokesman said Tuesday the death of an American woman aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship has been classified as suspicious. The 64-year-old Virginia woman was found dead Sunday inside her cabin aboard the Enchantment of the Seas, The Baltimore Sun reported. The company said her husband found her dead. The FBI did not release the names of the woman or her husband Tuesday, citing their investigation into the cause of death, according to the Sun. The woman was on a six-night, seven-day cruise to Florida and the Bahamas that left Baltimore March 18. FBI Baltimore field office spokesman Rich Wolf said agents boarded the ship Monday after it returned to Baltimore as scheduled. He says an autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause and manner of death. \\"The ship was working with us the whole way,\\" Wolf told the paper, adding that agents are interviewing the unidentified woman's husband. He declined to say whether the woman suffered any trauma. Maryland Port Administration spokesman Richard Scher told the Sun that the FBI completed its interviews after the ship's 2,409 passengers disembarked in Baltimore on Monday. In a statement released to the paper, Royal Caribbean said a member of its \\"Care Team\\" was providing support and assistance to the woman's family. \\"We extend our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the 64-year-old female guest from the United States who died while onboard Enchantment of the Seas,\\" the statement said.

Is The mosaic was probably created in 565/6. a good answer to this question? Choose from: (A). yes (B). no","completion":"(B). no The answer, \\"The mosaic was probably created in 565/6,\\" is not a good answer to the question, \\"Why have wall mosaics generally not survived in the region?\\" The reason it's not a good answer is because it doesn't address the factors that may have contributed to the poor preservation of wall mosaics in the region. A detailed explanation should be provided to answer the question thoroughly. Wall mosaics are an essential form of artistic expression that have been used in various architectural structures like churches, palaces, and public buildings since ancient times. Despite their historical significance and beauty, many wall mosaics have not survived in some regions. In order to provide a detailed answer to why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it's essential to explore various factors that may have contributed to their deterioration or disappearance. These factors could include natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, and socio-cultural influences. 1. Natural disasters: Earthquakes, floods, and fires may have caused the destruction of many wall mosaics. These natural disasters can compromise the structural integrity of the buildings, leading to the collapse of walls or the complete destruction of the structure, which would inevitably result in the loss of the mosaics. 2. Political conflicts: War and other political conflicts in the region may have led to the intentional or collateral damage to the buildings containing wall mosaics. In some cases, cultural artifacts like mosaics may have been intentionally destroyed as a symbolic act of victory or defiance during the conflict. 3. Environmental factors: Over time, environmental factors such as climate, humidity, and exposure to sunlight can contribute to the deterioration of wall mosaics. Materials used in the creation of these artworks, like stones, brick, and mortar, might become compromised due to continuous exposure to the elements. 4. Socio-cultural influences: Changes in societal values and beliefs may contribute to the neglect or destruction of wall mosaics. This could be due to an intentional rejection of the cultural or religious significance of the mosaics or simply due to a lack of appreciation for the art form. 5. Poor preservation efforts: In some cases, the local communities or authorities may not have had the necessary resources or knowledge to maintain the wall mosaics effectively. Poor preservation practices may lead to the degradation of these artworks over time. In conclusion, the survival of wall mosaics in a specific region can be influenced by several factors, including natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental factors, socio-cultural influences, and preservation efforts. To answer the question of why wall mosaics generally have not survived in a certain region, it is essential to assess these factors and provide a comprehensive explanation of their impact on the preservation of wall mosaics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cela est crucial car, en intégrant les perspectives de genre, nous pouvons reconnaître et aborder les problèmes et les défis spécifiques auxquels les femmes et les hommes sont confrontés dans divers contextes. En outre, cela garantit que les politiques et les interventions mises en place sont véritablement inclusives et tiennent compte des besoins de tous les individus, quel que soit leur sexe. L'intégration de la perspective de genre ne se limite pas seulement à tenir compte des besoins des femmes, mais elle englobe également la promotion de l'égalité des sexes et l'autonomisation des femmes, ainsi que la prise en compte des rôles et des responsabilités des hommes et des femmes dans les processus décisionnels. Cela inclut également la reconnaissance et l'analyse des différents besoins, intérêts et préoccupations des femmes et des hommes, ainsi que la réduction de toute inégalité de genre ou discrimination basée sur le sexe. En d'autres termes, il s'agit de veiller à ce que toutes les politiques, programmes et stratégies soient analysées de manière approfondie à travers le prisme du genre, en vue de déterminer leur impact sur les femmes, les hommes, les garçons et les filles. Un certain nombre d'organisations internationales, telles que les Nations Unies, l'Union européenne, et la Banque mondiale, ont encouragé et promu l'intégration des perspectives de genre, en élaborant des stratégies et des objectifs spécifiques pour atteindre l'égalité des genres à l'échelle mondiale. Toutefois, pour que l'intégration des perspectives de genre soit efficace, il est essentiel que les gouvernements et les autres entités impliquées disposent des ressources et des compétences nécessaires pour intégrer ces perspectives de manière efficace et cohérente dans toutes les politiques et les programmes. Cela inclut la formation des décideurs politiques et des gestionnaires de programmes, le suivi et l'évaluation réguliers des progrès réalisés et la mise en œuvre de mesures correctives si nécessaire. En conclusion, l'intégration des perspectives de genre dans les politiques et les programmes internationaux est une étape essentielle pour garantir que les besoins et les défis spécifiques auxquels les femmes et les hommes sont confrontés sont pris en compte.

For all that's been written about the show, there don't seem to be many stories from the set. Have a favorite anecdote? Will Arnett: We were shooting Season 2, and Liza Minnelli had been sued by her bodyguard and/or driver for sexual harassment. He was suing her for 100 million. I have no idea what became of that. But we were shooting, and she was there for a wardrobe fitting or whatever. Nobody knew Liza was even on-set. We were rolling. And she walked through the kitchen door, took center stage, put her hands out, and said, \\"Am I really that bad?\\" Meaning, \\"Was sex with me that bad that you had to sue me for 100 million?\\" It was so disarming. DETAILS: Your character, Gob, is famous for his ridiculous chicken dance. Do people ask you to do it? Will Arnett: Nonstop. I've been asked on the subway in New York, I've been asked in England. I did it once publicly—at an auction benefiting a hospital. It was for a good cause. But I don't do it. If you're reading this, don't ask me on the street to do it. DETAILS: You and Jason Bateman run a digital-marketing firm, Dumbdumb, that makes comedic shorts for brands like Subaru and Old Navy. Were you afraid people would say you sold out? Will Arnett: I think people would have said that five or ten years ago. Now everyone understands the economics of it. I don't care if you're in the coolest movie or on the coolest TV show—guys who are way too cool for school aren't paying the rent. Guys like Jason and me, we have families. DETAILS: You didn't become successful until you were in your thirties. Were you jealous of people whose careers had taken off earlier? Will Arnett: I never really spent time being jealous. Maybe I should have. I'd handicapped myself. Back then I was partying. Maybe I would have gotten more jobs if I didn't look so hungover all the time. I lived in a string of shitty apartments in New York. I had a futon on the floor—not even a frame—that I'd roll up during the day. I had a lot of dreams—I wanted to be taken seriously, and I had something important to say. I said, \\"I'll never read for TV!\\" Those are the trappings of youth. As you get older, you take yourself less seriously. That, I think, is actually the freedom of age. DETAILS: You're sober now. What was the turning point? Will Arnett: Every day at 5 o'clock, I'd go to Peter McManus on 19th and 7th. It's a classic Irish bar. For six years, I was there six nights a week. In the fall of '99, I did The Mike O'Malley Show for NBC. After two episodes, it was panned and it was canceled. I took it a lot harder than I thought. I had a lot of stuff going on in my life. I'd broken up with my then-girlfriend of many years. I proceeded to spend the next six to nine months on an unprecedented run. And by run, I mean downward spiral. A friend called me up, and she said, \\"What are you doing?\\" It was almost as simple as that. DETAILS: You were raised in Toronto. Your dad, a Harvard graduate, was the head of Molson for a time. What did you learn from him? Will Arnett: I remember asking my dad, \\"Why didn't you ever move to the States? You probably could have made a lot more money.\\" My dad said, \\"Because I have an obligation to give back.\\" I always admired him for that. DETAILS: When you were 12, your parents sent you to boarding school. Had you done something wrong? Will Arnett: I probably suffered from ADHD, but they weren't so quick to diagnose it back then. For PE, they'd drop you in the woods with a compass and a pack of matches. It gave you confidence that you could rely on yourself. ||||| There's a new budding summer romance in Hollywood. E!

Options: - exercise - dehydration - breathing hard - sweat - trip and fall Explain why a human would choose \\"sweat\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"Humans would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question \\"Running is a great workout, it really works up a what?\\" for several reasons, which can be understood by analyzing the physical aspects of running, as well as the purpose and process of sweating. Running is a form of aerobic exercise that engages multiple muscle groups and demands a lot of energy from the body. When a person runs, their heart rate increases, and the body works harder in order to provide the necessary oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. The muscles generate heat as they utilize energy to maintain the running motion. Sweating is a natural process that helps the body regulate its temperature. When the body's temperature rises, the sweat glands produce sweat, which is a fluid composed primarily of water, salt, and other minerals. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface, it cools down the body and helps maintain an optimal internal temperature. In the context of running, the human body experiences an increase in temperature due to the intense physical activity and the heat generated by working muscles. As a result, the body starts sweating to prevent overheating and maintain homeostasis. This means that sweat is a direct outcome of the vigorous nature of running, and thus is the most relevant answer to the question posed. The other options have their own explanations as to why they might not be the best answer: - Exercise: While running is indeed an exercise, the question specifically asks what running \\"works up.\\" Running is already the exercise, so it doesn't \\"work up\\" exercise. - Dehydration: Although running can lead to dehydration if one does not stay properly hydrated, dehydration is not an inevitable outcome of running. It is a potential result of not properly replenishing fluids lost through sweat, but it's not the only possible outcome. - Breathing hard: Running can definitely result in heavy breathing due to the increased oxygen demands of the body. However, the primary focus of the question is what running \\"works up,\\" and sweating is a more direct and universal result of running than heavy breathing. - Trip and fall: This option is not an inherent aspect of running. It's a possible risk or accident that can happen during running, but it's not something that running inherently \\"works up.\\" In conclusion, a human would choose \\"sweat\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most accurate representation of a natural response the body has to the act of running. Sweating is a direct result of increased heat production during running and helps regulate body temperature, making it the most suitable answer among the given options."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His girlfriend Karen (Christina Moore) comes up to him and quickly tells him she's pregnant, and before she can stop him, he announces to everybody that she is pregnant and proposes to her. She then tells him that it is not his baby.Meanwhile, Bill Little (Bill Engvall) is talking about marriage with his neighbor (Michael Papajohn). The neighbor points out that most marriages end in divorce, and Bill says that it takes a lot to make a marriage work, such as incriminating photos of him with a girl who was just a good listener and eager to please at the local nightclub.Elsewhere, a man opens up a storage shed to see the leotard-and-leopard-skirt (with a porn-star mustache) clad Everett (DJ Qualls) watching TV. He reprimands Everett for living here when he just works here and berates him for having been a cop for only four days.Sometime later, the three are getting set for their Monthly trip up to their deserted army recruitment camp; turns out these three are also army reservists and picking on Everett about his tendency to be trigger-happy is their form of entertainment.Meanwhile, on an army base somewhere, a Colonel gets a request for more troops for Fallujah and he pulls up the name of the base where the boys are staying and sends Sgt.

A:","completion":"The three friends, Larry, Bill, and Everett, are members of the Army Reserve. They are also acquaintances outside of their military service, as shown by their interactions and shared experiences in both their civilian and military lives. The movie \\"Delta Farce\\" is a comedy centered around these three unlikely and unprepared reservists who are unexpectedly called up for active duty and find themselves in a series of ridiculous and humorous situations throughout the course of the film. The plot introduces various elements that add layers to each character's background and personality, such as Larry working as a diner waiter, dealing with an unexpected pregnancy announcement from his girlfriend Karen, and ultimately proposing to her. Bill, on the other hand, discusses the challenges of marriage with his neighbor, revealing some flaws and indiscretions in his own relationship. Meanwhile, Everett is reprimanded for living in a storage shed at his workplace and exposed to ridicule for his brief experience as a cop before joining the reserves. Their dynamic as friends is further explored during their monthly trips to their deserted army recruitment camp, which serves as a bonding opportunity for the trio as well as an outlet for them to engage in lighthearted teasing, particularly towards the trigger-happy Everett. The story takes a turn when a Colonel, needing more troops for Fallujah, decides to send Sgt. Kilgore to assess the situation at the reserve base where the three friends are stationed. Upon arriving, Kilgore is unimpressed with their lack of discipline and puts them through a rigorous training regimen. This ultimately results in their deployment, adding an additional layer of confusion and comedy as they struggle to adapt to their new circumstances and face the reality of serving in a wartime situation. Through their shared experiences, both in their civilian lives and the unexpected military deployment, Larry, Bill, and Everett develop a bond that not only highlights the importance of friendship and camaraderie but also serves as a source of humor and lightheartedness amid the harsh realities they face. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to consider the potential appeal of the characters and storyline, the strength of the comedic elements, and the overall marketability of the film. Since the movie features a mix of relatable life challenges, military experiences, and humor, it may resonate with a wide range of audiences. However, factors such as cast, production quality, and how effectively the comedy translates to screen should also be taken into account when making your decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, there are slight differences in the context of each sentence: - Sentence 1 specifically mentions Cleveland's school voucher program. - Sentence 2 discusses an Ohio case, which, while closely related, does not explicitly mention Cleveland.

Considering the key similarities and differences outlined in Step 2, if the first sentence is true, it is very likely that the second sentence is also true. Both sentences mention similar rulings related to the constitutionality of vouchers and the need for choice in religious and secular schools. The only notable difference is that Sentence 1 refers to Cleveland's school voucher program, while Sentence 2 refers to an Ohio case. Since Cleveland is a city in Ohio, it is reasonable to assume that the Ohio case mentioned in Sentence 2 might be the same case related to Cleveland's school voucher program.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, newly elected Cuban President Manuel Urrutia Lleo, a devout Christian, began a program of closing gambling outlets, nightclubs, and other establishments associated with Havana's hedonistic lifestyle. This had an immediate impact on the livelihoods of local entertainers. As the Cuban government rapidly shifted towards the left in an effort to build a \\"classless and colourblind society\\", it struggled to define policy toward forms of cultural expression in the black community; expressions which had implicitly emphasized cultural differences. Consequently, the cultural and social centers were abolished, including the Afro-Cuban mutual aid Sociedades de Color in 1962, to make way for racially integrated societies. Private festivities were limited to weekend parties and organizers' funds were confiscated. The measures meant the closure of the Buena Vista Social Club. Although the Cuban government continued to support traditional music after the revolution, certain favor was given to the politically charged nueva trova, and poetic singer-songwriters such as Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes. The emergence of pop music and salsa, a style derived from Cuban music but developed in the United States, meant that son music became even less common. Cuban music experienced quite a radical change in the 1960s, as National Geographic notes: Cuban dance music also witnessed dramatic change beginning in the late 1960s, as groups explored the fusion of Cuban son with American rock, jazz and funk styles. Groups such as Los Van Van and Irakere established modern forms of Cuban music, paving the way for new rhythms and dances to emerge as well as fresh concepts in instrumentation. ... Cuba's dance music had already inspired a change from the older son-style dances, as younger Cubans broke free of step-oriented dances... The occurrence of these closures and the change in traditions is the simplest explanation of why many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was the program to close these establishments successful?","completion":"The provided text does not contain any direct quote or information about the success of the program to close these establishments.

Victim in the family: Matt Sandusky was preparing to testify against his adopted father during the child sex abuse trial. Jerry Sandusky's own adopted son has dramatically accused him of abuse as a jury deliberates over scores of sex abuse charges against the former Penn State coach. A lawyer for Matt Sandusky said the man told authorities that the former Penn State assistant football coach abused him. Matt Sandusky is one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children. His lawyers, Andrew Shubin and Justine Andronici, issued a statement on Thursday naming Matt Sandusky and saying that the 33-year-old had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors at his father's sex abuse trial. The statement says Matt Sandusky is 'a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,' but doesn't go into specifics. NBC News reported that Matt Sandusky was to take the stand as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's defence team ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence. Matt Sandusky's attorney's told the network: 'This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,' they said. The statement came after jurors began deliberating 48 charges against the ex-coach. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which he established in 1977. Lawyers for Matt and Jerry Sandusky and. prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Matt. Sandusky's lawyer says his client met with investigators very recently. Scroll down for video. New allegation: One of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted sons, Matt, has come forward through an attorney, saying that the ex-coach abused him too. Spouse: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie, pictured Thursday outside the courthouse, were married in 1966, and have no biological children, but they adopted six times. Matt Sandusky went to live with Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child and was adopted by them as an adult. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest in November, Matt Sandusky's ex-wife Jill Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping at their grandparents' home. At about the same time, details emerged that Matt Sandusky had attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky in 1995. He had come into the home through The Second Mile charity, and was first a foster child before being legally adopted. His name also came up last week during the testimony of one of Sandusky's 10 accusers. The man, dubbed Victim 4 by prosecutors, said Matt Sandusky was living at the Sandusky home on an occasion when he had stayed there overnight. When asked by prosecutors whether Jerry Sandusky ever engaged him in a soap battle in the showers, he recounted a time when he and Matt Sandusky had been playing racket ball. When they were done, he said, they went back to a locker room. Matt got undressed and got into the shower and then Victim 4 and Sandusky followed him in there, he testified. 'Me and Jerry came in. He started pumping his hand full of soap,' he said. At that point, Matt shut off his shower and left and went to another locker room to shower, the witness said. Asked by prosecutors about Matt's facial expression when the soap battles started, he replied: 'Nervous.' Jerry and Dottie Sandusky married in 1966 and have no biological children together, but adopted six times and have served as foster parents. The news comes just hours after a 30-year-old Ohio man became the first alleged Sandusky victim to reveal himself to the public, saying in an interview that he was sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky more than 100 times, starting when he was just ten. Travis Weaver said Sandusky preyed on. him after he and his brother went to a summer camp for the Second Mile, a. charity the coach founded and through which he is accused of cultivating. most of his victims. In the jurors' hands: Sandusky is pictured leaving court on Thursday after closing arguments in his child sex abuse trial. Coming forward: Travis Weaver is the first alleged victim of Jerry Sandusky to go public with his story of abuse at the hands of the Penn State coach. The revelation comes on the same day as a jury begins to deliberate Mr Sandusky's fate on 48 counts of sexual abuse charges. In closing arguments, his attorney said the accusers were liars who were hoping to cash in on legal settlements from the university. Mr Weaver is not one of the eight accusers who testified at trial, but he did tell his story to the grand jury that handed down the Sandusky's indictment, NBC News reported. An exclusive interview with Mr Weaver will air at 10pm Thursday on Rock Center. When asked what he would do if he ever met Sandusky again, Mr Weaver doesn't hesitate. Silence: For 15 years, Mr Weaver says, he thought he was Sandusky's only victim. That all changed last fall when the former coach was indicted on charges he abused other eight boys. 'I'd punch him in his mouth,' he said. 'There would be no reason to say anything. He knows what he did.' During the sex abuse trial, Sandusky's. lawyer Joe Amendola said the former coach is being railroaded by. overzealous investigators and prosecutors. He strenuously denied that. accusations and Sandusky has maintained his innocence since his arrest. last fall. Jurors in Jerry Sandusky's child sexual abuse case began deliberations on Thursday after his lawyer and a state prosecutor made closing arguments that followed seven days of testimony. The former Penn State University coach's attorney claimed all eight of Jerry Sandusky's accusers are lying about their sex abuse allegations in the hopes of winning big settlements from the college. Joe Amendola quoted Mother Theresa as he said his client had been railroaded by overzealous investigators and greedy witnesses. He told the jury that prosecutors' case 'doesn't make sense. Sandusky is accused of molesting eight boys over the course of 15 years in a case that shocked the nation and led to the firing of Joe Paterno, one of the most respected head coaches in college football history. When Amendola cited Sandusky's decades of charity work, he referred to the Mother Theresa 'Anyway.' It includes the line: 'If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.' Amendola laid the blame for the allegations at the feet of state police investigators who he said coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. Amendola. said the accusers were greedy an they lied about the abuse in the hopes. of winning big payouts from Penn State University so they could drive. new cars and buy big houses. Mr Weaver has also filed a lawsuit and is being represented by a well-known attorney who has specialized in sex abuse cases against the Catholic church. The abuse began in 1992, Mr Weaver told NBC's Rock Center, when he met Sandusky at a swimming pool at a camp sponsored by the Second Miles, which Sandusky founded to help at-risk young boys. 'It was like meeting my hero,' Mr Weaver said of Sandusky, who was once the top pick to replace legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. The individual attention Sandusky gave Mr Weaver began innocently, but gradually grew more and more sinister, he said. It began with a shower in the Penn State football team's locker room. 'After the shower was over... he'd dry me off with a towel. He'd say he was trying to wrestle with me... and then it progressed into oral sex,' Mr Weaver told NBC. He always assumed he was the only victim, he said. He never imagined there have been other boys until Sandusky was arrested last fall. Mr Weaver also blasted Sandusky's wife, Dottie, who testified that she never saw or heard anything that would have made her think her husband was molesting boys. He recalled on incident when Sandusky performed oral sex on him in a bedroom across the hall from Mrs Sandusky. 'How could she not know?' Mr Weaver said. He man said the abuse continued for four years until he moved away to Ohio to flee Sandusky. Watch video here. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy.

Include supporting documentation of entries on your card. Bring your record card to all medical appointments.\\"","completion":"Title: The Importance of Using an Immunization Tracker and Maintaining Accurate Records Introduction Immunizations play a vital role in safeguarding our health by helping our bodies build resilience and immunity against infectious diseases. As new vaccines are developed and immunization schedules streamline, it is essential to keep a thorough record of the vaccines we have received. This is where an immunization tracker comes in handy, ensuring that our vaccinations are up-to-date and recorded accurately. This article will delve into the importance of getting an immunization tracker, making backups, including supporting documentation and the role played by carrying your record card to all medical appointments. The Value of an Immunization Tracker Immunization trackers offer several benefits for both individuals and healthcare providers. They are easy-to-use tools that can help monitor and organize all vaccination-related information at our fingertips: 1. Staying up-to-date: With an immunization tracker, you can easily keep track of your vaccination schedule. This ensures that you never miss any important vaccines, which could potentially expose you to preventable infectious diseases. 2. Travel requirements: Some countries require proof of vaccination as part of the entry process. Presenting an updated immunization record can prevent complications and potential delays when traveling. 3. Healthcare provider collaboration: By having a comprehensive immunization history, healthcare providers can accurately assess and guide your treatment if you have a disease that needs specific immunizations. 4. Personal health management: An immunization tracker can help you become proactive about your health, making informed decisions in consultation with medical professionals. The Importance of Backups and Supporting Documentation It's never wise to rely solely on the original immunization record card. Disasters, such as fires, floods, or theft, can lead to important documents being misplaced or destroyed. Here's why you need to create at least one backup of your immunization record card and include supporting documentation for all entries: 1. Proof of immunizations: If your original record card becomes lost or damaged, a backup will serve as a reliable record of the vaccines you've received. Keeping supporting documentation, such as receipts or medical reports, will make it easier to verify the entries and details on your card. 2. Insurance claims: In the event of an injury or illness related to your vaccinations, having accurate records can support your claims and ensure that insurance companies can process them without undue delays. 3. School or work regulations: Some schools and workplaces have immunization requirements to protect the institution's population against infectious diseases. Backing up your records and having supporting documentation allows you to easily prove that you meet these requirements. Bringing Your Record Card to Medical Appointments To achieve a holistic approach to healthcare, medical professionals need access to accurate and up-to-date information about your health, including immunization history. Here are a few reasons why carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments is essential: 1. Continuity of care: By reviewing your immunization record card, your healthcare provider can make more informed decisions about any necessary immunizations or booster shots, as well as identify and address potential vaccine-related side effects. 2. Coordination of treatments: For specific medical conditions or treatments, your medical professional may need to know if you've received certain vaccinations. For instance, your vaccination status may impact the choice of medications or timing of surgeries. 3. Preventing avoidable complications: Uninformed booster shots or additional vaccinations could lead to adverse reactions or complications. By having your immunization record available, your healthcare provider can easily cross-reference the details and prevent any potential mishaps. Conclusion In conclusion, investing in an immunization tracker and maintaining accurate records is an essential process for not just individual healthcare management but also for the betterment of public health. Backing up your records and carrying your immunization record card to all medical appointments can save time, reduce the risk of adverse reactions, and contribute to more informed medical decisions. By doing so, you play an active role in maintaining your health and promoting the overall well-being of the community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In college, I decided to focus primarily on track and pursue my dream of going to the Paralympics. With the support of a great coach and team, I was selected as a member of Team USA and competed in track at the Paralympic Games in London in 2012. On Saturday, April 6, I embarked on the most challenging journey of my life. I left Los Angeles, heading toward New York City in my racing wheelchair -- a 71-day journey of 3,300 miles. While I didn't know what to expect or how my body would react to the demands of \\"pushing\\" the equivalent of two to three marathons a day, I knew one thing for sure -- I'd get it done. I committed to Push Across America as my way of giving back to Stay-Focused, an organization that has significantly impacted my life. During my Paralympic experience in London, where 80,000 fans cheered for me and my fellow Paralympians at each and every event, I was impressed with how the fans embraced us as athletes -- athletes first,","completion":"disabled second. It was this positive attitude and embracing spirit that fueled my desire to give back to my community and inspire others through my journey. Push Across America was not just about the physical challenge but also about raising awareness and funding for Stay-Focused, a non-profit organization that serves disabled children and young adults by offering adaptable sports experiences and opportunities. In the weeks leading up to my departure, I trained rigorously and prepared by reviewing expert advice on techniques, nutrition, and gear to ensure my success. Day after day, I pushed through various terrains, battling unpredictable weather conditions, including high heat, strong winds, and even hailstorms. I tackled steep inclines, difficult descents, and countless miles of rough pavement. Along the way, I encountered the most amazing and supportive people who came out to cheer me on, provide me with shelter, food, and encouragement, and share their own inspiring stories with me. These interactions drove me to keep pushing forward and inspired me to work even harder. As I approached the East Coast, media outlets picked up on my story, and the visibility for Push Across America and Stay-Focused dramatically increased. More people started to join me on my journey, either by pushing alongside me for a portion or by sharing their own stories on social media and news outlets. This widespread support showed me the true power of community and the impact a single person's story could have on so many lives. After 71 days of intense physical and emotional challenges, I finally reached my destination: New York City. I crossed the finish line in Central Park, accompanied by friends, family, and supporters who had followed my journey. Though my body was exhausted and my hands were blistered from trembling along the wheelchair's wheels, my spirit soared with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude. As I rested and reflected on my journey, I realized that I had achieved my goal: people not only saw me as an athlete but as a testament to the power of perseverance and the strength of the human spirit. Push Across America raised over 150,000 for Stay-Focused, which enabled the organization to expand its programming and reach more young adults with disabilities. My story had inspired others to break through their own limitations and chase their dreams, regardless of the obstacles they faced. The story of Push Across America doesn't just end with the completion of my 3,300-mile journey. It serves as a reminder that we all possess untapped potential and that we can achieve extraordinary feats when we step out of our comfort zones. It's a testament to the power of community and the importance of supporting each other to create a more inclusive, understanding, and just world. As I continue to compete on an international level and work with Stay-Focused, I carry the lessons and experiences of Push Across America with me, using them to shape my future and the lives of those I aim to inspire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"An' seem' as how they was only one company hereabouts Howard's Rangers they didn't try.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"In other places, there are lots of companies.\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"In other places, there are lots of companies\\" based on the premise \\"An' seem' as how they was only one company hereabouts Howard's Rangers they didn't try,\\" we need to analyze the context and information provided in the statement, as well as consider possible interpretations and connections between them. First, let's break down the premise. It appears to be set in a colloquial, informal tone, implying a non-technical or casual conversation. There is mention of one company, Howard's Rangers, and the fact that there's only one in the immediate vicinity. The final part of the sentence, \\"they didn't try,\\" establishes a lack of substantial competition or motivation for Howard's Rangers, possibly due to the absence of other companies. However, there's not much information provided about other places or regions, so we cannot directly deduce that there are lots of companies in other places. The limited scope of this statement hinders our ability to infer anything concrete about other locations. To determine if the hypothesis is true, we need to examine some possible interpretations of the premise: 1. Interpretation 1: The premise implies that there is a lesser concentration of companies in the speaker's local area compared to other places. In this case, the hypothesis could be considered true. However, this is still an assumption, as the statement does not explicitly contain information about other locations. 2. Interpretation 2: The unique context of the speaker's local area has resulted in there only being one company. This implies that the situation is specific to this area and does not necessarily reflect the rest of the world. Therefore, the hypothesis may or may not be true, as there's no tangible claim regarding the company concentration in other places. 3. Interpretation 3: The existence of only one company in the area is purely coincidental and doesn't hold any relation to the presence of multiple companies in other locations. In this interpretation, the premise can neither confirm nor disprove the hypothesis. Ultimately, although the premise provides insight into the local presence of one company, Howard’s Rangers, and implies a lack of competition, there is not enough information to definitely support the hypothesis that \\"In other places, there are lots of companies.\\" It's essential to gather more comprehensive data about company distribution in various regions before drawing such a conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Subject - Nate, action - struggle for Ricky, confirmation of love - for her (referring to Ricky) Sentence 2: Subject - Ricky, action - fight for Nate, confirmation of love - for them (referring to Nate) Step 2: Compare the subjects and actions. Subjects: In sentence 1, Nate is the subject, while in sentence 2, Ricky is the subject. These are different. Actions: In both sentences, the characters are performing similar actions - struggling or fighting for the other person. However, the choice of words is different (struggle vs. fight). Confirmation of love: In both sentences, the subjects confirm their love for the other person. Step 3: Determine whether the sentences mean the same thing. While there are similarities between the two sentences, such as both characters expressing their love for the other and taking some action to fight for the relationship, there are differences as well. The subjects are different, and the choice of words used to describe their actions (struggle vs. fight) is also different. Conclusion: These two sentences do not mean the exact same thing, but they are similar in expressing that both Nate and Ricky are willing to fight for each other and confirm their love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\", answer the following question.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idol Meter: The finals Performance order: Studies by WhatNotToSing.com and others have established that singing first on the show is a clear handicap, while singing last is a big plus and second-to-last a lesser but still significant plus. So show-closers get 10 points, the second-to-last contestant gets 5, the opener gets minus 5, the rest zero. Performance quality: Buzz, judges' verdict and (especially) song choice are vital to a contestant's survival, but none of that would mean a thing without what we watch Idol for: the performance itself. It's worth anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points. Exceptional circumstances: Idol is live, and the unpredictable can happen. When it does, we'll dole out anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points for incidents including, but not limited to, emotional shout-outs or breakdowns, sickbed performances, superstar stage lighting, forgetting lyrics, false starts, major vocal gaffes, tantrums, overt sullenness, sassing a judge, being adopted as perverse causes clbres or anything else that might influence voting. Judges' verdict: Respect them or not, the judges' opinions can't help but influence voters. So positive comments from Randy, Steven and Jennifer are worth up to 6 points each, while a negative comment scores as much as minus 6. If a performance receives a unanimous, three-judge, flat-out rave, 3 bonus points will be added for a total of 21. Dial Idol: DialIdol.com, which calculates phone-voting strength from busy signals, has had a strong record of predicting eliminations over the years, though its accuracy might suffer this year as online voting is being allowed for the first time. While we monitor the situation, contestants receiving green (or safe) ratings from Dial Idol get 5 points. The lowest-rated contestant gets minus 5; the remainder, in the yellow danger zone, score zero. Online buzz: Standout performances tend to generate high volumes of post-show online searches, so contestants who spike in Google Trends, Yahoo Buzz, Twitter's popular topics or other queries get 14, 10 or 5 points. Outcome: Nothing spells danger for an Idol contestant more than showing up in the dreaded bottom three the previous week. Contestants score minus 5 points if they were in the bottom three or plus 20 points if they escaped. Contestants who elude elimination on their first trip to the bottom three get a one-week bounce worth 5 points. Summary:","completion":"This news article discusses the scoring system and factors that impact contestant rankings on the singing competition show, Idol. Factors include performance order, performance quality, exceptional circumstances, judges' verdicts, DialIdol.com predictions, online buzz, and outcome from the previous week.

It 's not fair , and I feel incredibly disrespected and violated by the whole situation . Why should I have to pay for her poor choices ? Question Why is the narrator so upset about the bill ? Answer:","completion":"The narrator is deeply upset about the bill for several reasons, each contributing to the emotional turmoil they are experiencing. Here are the main factors explaining the narrator's distress: 1. Lack of respect: The narrator feels disrespected by the person who has downplayed the issue, belittling its significance in their life. Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, that individual has attempted to minimize its impact, undermining the narrator's emotional response. This lack of understanding and empathy is hurtful and adds to the frustration. 2. Unfair burden of responsibility: The narrator explicitly mentions not having purchased a single item on the Best Buy card, making it evident that the bill is not a result of their actions. Consequently, they are being forced to bear the financial responsibility for someone else's choices. This unjust imposition of obligation is frustrating and leads to profound disquiet. 3. Emotional violation: The whole situation has left the narrator feeling violated, as someone else's actions have interfered with their life and personal finances. This intrusion is far from a minor inconvenience; it carries emotional weight and generates a sense of vulnerability, further heightening the narrator's distress. 4. Long-lasting impact: The narrator emphasizes that the issue will have a \\"profound and long-lasting impact\\" on their life. This implies that the financial burden might affect their credit score, future opportunities, and overall stability for an extended period, significantly worsening their quality of life and causing considerable anxiety. 5. Absence of accountability: The narrator is upset because they are being forced to pay for someone else's poor choices, while the person responsible does not seem to face any consequences. This lack of accountability creates a feeling of injustice and further aggravates the narrator's discontent. In conclusion, the narrator is so upset about the bill because it represents a convergence of disrespect, emotional violation, and unfair imposition of responsibility, all stemming from another person's poor choices. This situation has caused considerable distress and is likely to have long-lasting negative consequences in the narrator's life, amplifying their sense of injustice and frustration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Money talks: December 19th 2011 This discussion demonstrates that the Economist at least still obsesses about the banks, and their Eurobonds. I know they are the ones that pay you, but as Mario Draghi of the ECB has realized, these bonds are not now the central issue. The banks have made bad and risky loans by lending to the Euro States instead of the private economy. Indeed they continue to do so. They must: 1. Be forced to realize that they are going to pay ALL the losses on the Euro bonds. 2. The banks must be forced to stop lending to the Euro states, that is stop buying (these high risk) Euro bonds, NOW. That is the ONLY way to stop these countries spending excessively. In fact the cure, the solution, to the Euro crisis is simple, and has one simple solution as all basic solutions have. It must be announced that ALL banks WILL NOT BE RECOMPENSED for their Euro bond losses, and if the continue buying Euro bonds (very foolishly) they must take these inevitable losses on the chin. Everybody, except a complete fool, can see that the EU is heading for a system wide bond DEFAULT. The banks are heading now for pretty well a 100% loss on their Euro bonds. These loopy discussions by the Economists economists (I know that they are paid to say these thing) that some organization (Father Christmas?) is going to refund the Banks' losses on the Eurobonds should cease. After all, these comments are being recorded and will be hauled back to blame you. No, not even Germany, the IMF, the ECB, combined, can repay these losses. FORGET IT.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 for p, we shall first simplify the equation by combining like terms. 0 = (-8069*p + 8099*p) + 150 Since -8069*p and 8099*p are like terms (both have the variable p), we can add their coefficients: (-8069 + 8099) * p = 30 * p So, the simplified equation is: 0 = 30*p + 150 Now, we need to isolate the variable p. We can do this by moving all the terms involving p to one side of the equation and all the constants to the other side. In this case, we want to get rid of the constant term 150 on the right side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 150 from both sides: 0 - 150 = 30*p + 150 - 150 -150 = 30*p Now, we can solve for p by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is 30: -150 / 30 = 30*p / 30 -5 = p So, the solution to the equation 0 = -8069*p + 8099*p + 150 is p = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven. Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","completion":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when the gas inside it is heated. This can be explained by understanding the behavior of gases using the ideal gas law, which is represented by the equation: PV = nRT where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. In an airtight sauna room, the volume (V) is constant. When the gas (air) inside the room is heated, its temperature (T) increases. According to the ideal gas law, when the temperature increases and the volume remains constant, the pressure (P) must also increase to maintain the balance in the equation. This increased pressure in the airtight sauna room could be causing the customers' ears to pop when they leave the room. When they exit to a different environment, the ears need to adjust to the pressure difference between the sauna and the outside air, causing the sensation of ear-popping similar to being on an airplane."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, but I will provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive explanation to help you understand the meaning of \\"add my two cents\\" better. \\"Add my two cents\\" is a common phrase used in conversation that signifies a person is sharing their opinion or thoughts on a particular matter. The phrase is derived from the original expression \\"put(or throw) in one's two cents,\\" which has evolved over time. The \\"two cents\\" in the phrase refers to a metaphorical and minimal amount of money, representing the idea that the speaker's contribution to the conversation might not be significant or valuable, but they still want to express their views. In American currency, two cents is a small value, so using this term emphasizes the humility or cautiousness with which the person is speaking. The phrase often carries a tone of humility as it suggests that the speaker is aware that their input might not be the most important or essential part of the discussion. They want to acknowledge that they are respectfully offering their perspective without dominating or overwhelming the conversation. As mentioned in your original answer, \\"add my two cents\\" can also be used with a touch of irony when someone has a strong opinion about something and wants to make their point emphatically. In these cases, the phrase is used to indicate feigned modesty as the speaker knows that their opinion may be more influential or important than they are making it out to be. Overall, \\"add my two cents\\" is a useful expression to communicate one's thoughts or opinions in a conversation without appearing overly assertive or opinionated, and sometimes with a sense of irony to make a strong point."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts.

A:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly provide the crude death rate for 1990. While a life table does indeed give a more complete understanding of mortality rates by separating the data by age, it still doesn't answer your question about the specific crude death rate in 1990. The crude death rate (CDR) is a number that illustrates the number of deaths in a certain year for every 1,000 people in a population. It's an important demographic metric which helps assess the mortality situation of a region or a country. The crude death rate for 1990 varied depending on the country or region in question. For a more accurate answer, you would need a specific region or data source to find the rate you are looking for. For instance, in 1990, the crude death rate for the United States was approximately 8.6 deaths per 1,000 population. On the other hand, the global crude death rate in 1990 was estimated to be around 9.3 deaths per 1,000 population.

Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What city in Pakistan is a global city? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the meaning of 'global city' A global city, also known as a world city or an alpha city, is a city that is considered to be an important node in the global economic system. These cities serve as key centers for global capital and trade, and possess a high level of influence in terms of culture, politics, and technology. Step 2: Research about cities in Pakistan Research various cities in Pakistan to determine which one(s) might fit the criteria for being a global city. Some of the major cities in Pakistan include Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. Step 3: Evaluate the cities in terms of global city criteria Evaluate the major cities based on their extent of influence in the global economy, as well as their cultural, political, and technological impact. a) Karachi: As Pakistan's largest city and economic hub, Karachi is home to the country's largest collection of businesses, industries, and financial institutions. The city also hosts the largest seaport in the country, Port of Karachi, making it an essential player in international trade. Karachi's diverse cultural scene and role as a key city in Pakistan's media industry further contribute to its status as a global city. b) Lahore: Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is known for its rich cultural heritage, architectural landmarks, and educational institutions. While Lahore is an important city in Pakistan, its global influence may not be as extensive as that of Karachi. c) Islamabad: As the capital city of Pakistan, Islamabad holds significant political power and influence. The city is home to numerous government institutions, international organizations, and embassies. However, its impact on the global economy and culture is less pronounced than Karachi's. d) Peshawar: Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has a strategic location near Afghanistan and serves as a significant trade center linking Central Asia to South Asia. Its role in regional trade and historical significance contribute to its global status, but its overall global impact may be less than that of Karachi. Step 4: Determine the most suitable city based on the evaluation Based on the evaluation, Karachi appears to have the strongest claim as a global city in Pakistan, given its crucial role in international trade, its economic clout, and its cultural influence. Answer: The city in Pakistan that can be considered a global city is Karachi, due to its significant contributions to the global economy, extensive international trade connections, and cultural impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process: 1. Pulse 1/2 stick softened butter with 2 tablespoons chopped crystallized ginger in a food processor: Doing this creates a ginger-infused butter mixture that will add a nice spicy undertone to the toast. 2. Spread the ginger-butter on 4 slices toasted white bread: The next step is to spread the ginger-butter mixture onto the pre-toasted slices of white bread evenly. This ensures that each resulting piece of toast will have a consistent flavor profile. 3. Top the toast with grapefruit segments: Arrange the grapefruit segments on top of the bread slices with ginger-butter spread. This brings the tart, citrusy essence of the grapefruit into play, complementing the spiciness of the ginger. 4. Sprinkle sugar on top of the grapefruit segments: To finish off the grapefruit-ginger toast, sprinkle an appropriate amount of sugar on each toast. This step adds sweetness to the dish to balance out the tangy grapefruit and spicy ginger flavors. By following these steps, you will create a delicious and unique grapefruit-ginger toast that features a perfect balance of sweet, tart, and spicy flavors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In my case I was made redundant, and, when it came to looking around for a new job, I just couldn't face going back into an office again. So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do. Interviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country? Roger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring. Interviewer: So what happened, why didn't you? Roger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again. Interviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along? Roger: No, you have to have a diploma.

So, where did you go when you did decide to move? Roger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own. Interviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills?

I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd. It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father. When we meet him, he's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a 'Jackass' movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join his 'crew'. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mom, Marie. She remarried Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank's a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls. It's clear that Rod's not going to earn Frank's respect till he can beat him. We find out Frank needs a 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass' once he's healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to 'go big' on one stunt. Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch- at a children's birthday party. There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump. He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole town turns out and the world tunes in. Does he make the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the 50k? Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod? Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out.

The question is asking about how many social classes existed in the Han Dynasty, and the answer you provided does not offer a specific number of classes. For more clarity, the Han Dynasty society was mainly composed of four social classes. These were the emperor and his court, the scholars (also known as gentry), the farmers (or peasants), and the merchants. 1. Emperor and his court: The ruling class comprised the emperor and his extended family, his many courtiers and civil servants. 2. Scholars (Gentry): This was a literate class, often from noble families or were officials that passed civil service examinations. 3. Farmers (Peasants): They are common people and were considered the backbone of the empire because of the basic need of food. 4. Merchants: Despite being successful, wealthy, and contributing to the economy, merchants were generally considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy because they were thought to get rich from the works of others. Apart from these four major classes, there was another class of people that one could say were outside the social classes, which the Chinese call the \\"mean people\\". These were people who did not own land, and it also included craftsmen and skillful artisans, making this situation more like a caste system than a rigid social stratification system.

Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns).

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given inputs 'i', 'j', and A, where 'i' and 'j' are integers and A is a list. A list is shown by two brackets and comma-separated numbers and characters inside, like ['1', '12', 'l']. You need to concatenate all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element, and then reverse the resulting string. 'i' and 'j' will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. 'i' will always be less than 'j'.

Kuroń , Modzelewski and Michnik were detained again and a majority of the \`\` Komandosi '' members were imprisoned .","completion":"Both sentences describe a situation where Kuroń, Modzelewski, and Michnik were apprehended, and a significant number of \\"Komandosi\\" members were incarcerated. However, there are slight differences in the context and connotations of the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained,\\" affecting the level of formality and the legal meaning of the two sentences. 1. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were arrested again, and the majority of \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, the word \\"arrested\\" typically implies that formal charges have been brought against the individuals, and they have been taken into custody by law enforcement. Arrests are part of the legal process that leads to a trial or some other form of judicial investigation. This generally includes being read their legal rights, being booked into a facility, and potentially having a bail amount set. The use of \\"arrested\\" highlights the severity of the situation and the involvement of the criminal justice system. 2. \\"Kuroń, Modzelewski and Michnik were detained again and a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members were imprisoned.\\" In this sentence, \\"detained\\" refers to the temporary restraining of the individuals' freedom of movement, typically by law enforcement, which can happen for various reasons. Detainment may happen due to suspicion, questioning, or for further investigation. Detainment is less formal than an arrest, and the individuals may or may not be formally charged with any crimes. It is also possible for them to be released without any legal consequences if it is determined that they have no connection with the ongoing investigation or have not committed any criminal actions. While both sentences imply the apprehension of Kuroń, Modzelewski, and Michnik, as well as the imprisonment of a majority of the \\"Komandosi\\" members, the key difference lies in the words \\"arrested\\" and \\"detained.\\" In essence, the first sentence suggests a more formal legal process, while the second sentence portrays a situation that might not necessarily lead to charges or trial. Nonetheless, both sentences communicate that the individuals were taken into custody and members of the \\"Komandosi\\" faced imprisonment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Why did Manny slow down?

Devil's Due was filmed in America","completion":"Based on the information given in the text, we cannot conclusively validate the sentence \\"Devil's Due was filmed in America.\\" Here is my rationale: 1. We learn that Devil's Due is an American film. This means it was largely produced by an American production house, featuring largely American crew and cast. This however doesn't necessarily imply that it was filmed in America. 2. We learn that it's a found footage psychological horror film, which indicates the style of the film but doesn't reveal anything about its filming location. 3. The directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, along with the writer Lindsay Devlin, are mentioned, as are the actors.

Valencia was also third in industrial and economic development; notable milestones include urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s, the creation of the Banco de Valencia in 1900, construction of the Central and Columbus markets, and the construction of the Gare du Nord railway station, completed in 1921. The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities. This production was promoted by the Ateneo Mercantil de Valencia (Mercantile Athenaeum of Valencia), especially by its chairman, Tomás Trénor y Palavicino, and had the support of the Government and the Crown; it was officially inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII himself.","completion":"The creation of the Banco de Valencia occurred second, after the urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Maria had always been a shy person.; 2). Tanya had always been a shy person.;","completion":"Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person. This trait is often characterized by a lack of self-confidence, feelings of inadequacy, and a general reluctance to engage in social situations. This distinction between the two girls wasn't a judgment on their qualities, abilities, or values but rather, a distinct difference in their social dispositions that played a significant role in how their lives played out, specifically in terms of forming friendships. Growing up, Maria's shyness manifested in various ways. She tended to avoid eye contact, struggled to voice her opinions or join in group discussions, and often found herself hesitating to participate in activities for fear of being judged or criticized. Additionally, her introverted nature made it challenging for her to navigate school functions, extracurricular activities, and other settings where making new friends was a common expectation. Consequently, others may have perceived Maria as distant or aloof, which further diminished her ability to connect with her peers and establish meaningful relationships. On the other hand, Tanya's personality and social skills enabled her to form multiple connections with ease. As an outgoing, friendly, and warm person, she naturally drew others towards her. She wasn't afraid of stepping out of her comfort zone, and her open, approachable demeanor made it easy for her peers to feel at ease around her. This magnetism translated into a larger circle of friends and acquaintances for Tanya, helping her foster relationships that could range from surface-level connections to deep, lasting friendships. Despite their different social experiences, it is essential to recognize that Maria's and Tanya's individual traits are not inherently superior or inferior in any way. Shyness, introversion, extroversion, boldness – all have their unique strengths and challenges. What's important is understanding and embracing those differences and learning how to navigate social situations to form meaningful connections. For Maria, taking small steps to build her self-confidence, enhance her communication skills, and push herself to explore new experiences could help her expand her social circle. In turn, Tanya could continue leveraging her outgoing personality to uplift others, offering her support and friendship to those who may feel less comfortable in social situations. Ultimately, Maria had a lot less friends than Tanya because Maria had always been a shy person, but every person has their own unique journey when it comes to building and maintaining friendships. Acknowledging these individual differences and working together to support one another's growth can lead to stronger, more diverse, and meaningful relationships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Beehives -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today, Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away.

In terms of accessibility, these corridors are open 24 hours, serving as a public thoroughfare between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre. This allows people to move between these locations at any time of day or night, providing a key convenience and accessibility feature for the residents, visitors, and workers in Utrecht. Maintaining these corridors as public spaces contributes not only to the day-to-day operations of Hoog Catharijne as a large indoor shopping center but also to the overall urban design and functionality of Utrecht as a city. They act as connectors between major parts of the city, integrating the shopping center with the surrounding urban fabric and enhancing the overall cohesion and movement within the city. Looking forward, with the 20-year renovation plan starting from 2004, parts of Hoog Catharijne will be redeveloped as part of the improvements to the larger station area, including the recreation of parts of the city's network of canals. These renovations and changes will likely play into how the shopping center corridors continue to function as public places and how they contribute to the overall character and dynamics of the city of Utrecht."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: One benefit is better meeting the diverse information needs of investors in evaluating funds, which has become more difficult as the number of funds has grown. Hypothesis: Investors all need the same information. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that a benefit of better meeting diverse information needs of investors is in evaluating funds, which becomes harder as the number of funds increases. This implies that different investors may have various information needs when it comes to evaluating funds. The diverse information needs also suggest that each investor may have unique preferences and priorities when assessing fund performance, investment risks, and potential opportunities. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that \\"investors all need the same information,\\" which contradicts the premise. By suggesting that all investors have identical information needs, the hypothesis overlooks the fact that investors have different profiles, risk tolerance levels, and investment goals. These varying factors logically lead to diverse information requirements while evaluating funds. To gain a deeper understanding, let's examine the key differences between the premise and hypothesis in greater detail: 1. Diversity of information needs vs. uniform information needs: The premise emphasizes the requirement for diverse information to cater to the individual preferences of investors. This is based on the understanding that each investor may have specific details they value or require while making investment decisions. In contrast, the hypothesis assumes that all investors share identical information requirements, discarding the likelihood of any diversity in their preferences or decision-making criteria. 2. Challenges arising from an increasing number of funds: The premise acknowledges that as the number of funds grows, it becomes more challenging for investors to evaluate them properly based on their unique needs. The presence of a large number of funds also necessitates better-tailored information and greater customizability to cater to a vast range of investor preferences. However, the hypothesis contradicts this notion by asserting that all investors need the same information, regardless of the variety and complexity of the available funds. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis represent opposing viewpoints, with the premise suggesting the significance of diverse information needs to cater to a variety of investors while the hypothesis argues that all investors require the same information. As such, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the two cannot be logically reconciled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A 15-year-old schoolboy could save millions of lives after he invented a new, low-cost test that can detect the early stages of a deadly form of cancer. Jack Andraka from Crownsville, Maryland, developed a simple dip-stick test for levels of mesothelin, a biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer found in blood and urine. It promises to revolutionise treatment of the disease, which currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages. Prodigy: Jack Andraka speaks after receiving Smithsonian Magazine's first annual American Ingenuity Award for youth achievement in Washington, DC. last November. He has invented a new test for pancreatic cancer. Jack's invention, for which he was last month awarded the grand prize of 75,000 in scholarship funds at the 2012 Intel Science Fair, means that patients now have a simple method to detect pancreatic cancer before it becomes invasive. His novel patent-pending sensor has proved to be 28 times faster, 28 times less expensive, and over 100 times more sensitive than current tests. Thanks to the test, pancreatic cancer. patients could now get an early earning to seek medical help when it. still has a chance of working, which could, he claims, potentially bump. up survival rates to 'close to 100 per cent'. Deadly: Pancreatic cancer is the same form of the disease that caused late Apple CEO Steve Jobs' long decline and eventual death. The test works in a similar way to diabetic testing strips, with his paper strips using only a drop of blood to determine whether patients carry the mesothelin biomarker. It is said to be over 90 per cent accurate, practically instant - and costs only 3 cents. And what's more, his simple test can also be used to detect ovarian and lung cancer, and it could be easily altered to detect the biomarkers of a range of other conditions. 'What’s so cool about that is its applicability to other diseases…for example other forms of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, environmental contaminants like E Coli, salmonella,' Jack told Take Part. 'All for three cents for a test that takes five minutes to run.' Jack was moved to come up with the. test after a family friend passed away from pancreatic cancer, but it. was as he surreptitiously read a journal article about carbon nanotubes. in a biology lesson that he had his 'epiphany'. But. that eureka moment was not enough; the persistent teenager was rejected. by 197 scientists he solicited for help with his research - with some. plainly telling him his idea simply would not work. A cluster of pancreatic cancer cells: The disease currently kills 19 out of 20 sufferers after five years - largely because its so difficult to detect until its final stages when patients are less likely to respond to treatment. To come up with his new pancreatic cancer test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with conductive single walled carbon nanotubes. He used the mixture to coat strips of ordinary filter paper, making them conductive, and determined the optimal layering using a scanning election microscope. Cell media spiked with varying amounts of mesothelin was then tested against to the paper biosensor and any change in the electrical potential of the sensor strip (due to the changing conductivity of the nanotubes) was measured. Changes in conductivity occurred because the antibodies on the strips binded to the mesothelin and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes further apart and changing the electrical properties of the network. The more mesothelin applied, the more the antibodies would grow and the weaker the electrical signal would become. Andraka's sensor costs 3.00 and 10 tests can be performed per strip, taking 5 minutes each. The test is said to be 168 times faster, 26,667 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive than current testing methods. Finally Dr Anirban Maitra, a professor of pathology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, agreed to give him space in the lab and mentored him through the process of developing the test. To create the test, Jack mixed human mesothelin-specific antibodies with single-walled carbon nanotubes used the product to coat strips of ordinary filter paper. The nanotubes make the paper conductive, but when mesothelin is applied the antibodies would bind to the biomarker and enlarge, spreading the nanotubes apart and changing the strips' electrical properties. The more mesothelin present, the more antibodies bind and grow, and the weaker the electrical signal becomes - allowing scientists to accurately measure the levels of the biomarker. Now the teenage prodigy has plans to mass-market the tests and make them widely available to the public, which he believes could alter the balance of power in medicine. 'Essentially what I’m envisioning here is that this could be on your shelf at your Walgreens, your Kmart,' he said. 'Let’s say you suspect you have a condition…you buy the test for that. And you can see immediately if you have it. 'Instead of your doctor being the doctor, you’re the doctor.'

Context: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support.

Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region.

He was a key figure in the country's history, playing an instrumental role in shaping its political landscape and implementing social and economic reforms during his tenures as president. His legacy is remembered fondly, and numerous places and institutions in Uruguay bear his name, including the Parque Batlle. His first term, which falls outside of the given range, took place from 1903 to 1907. Still, he assumed office again from 1911 to 1915, as specified in the statement. During his second term, he continued to advocate for progressive policies that would come to define Uruguay's welfare state and political system. Some of these reforms included the separation of church and state, the establishment of the eight-hour workday, the provision of free and compulsory primary education, and the nationalization of key industries. The fact that Parque Batlle is named after José Batlle y Ordóñez is a testament to his significant contributions to the Uruguayan society and the country's development. However, it is crucial to remember that his time in office was not limited to 1911-1915, as he also served a term from 1903-1907. In conclusion, the statement does indeed provide the correct answer to the question, as José Batlle y Ordóñez was indeed President of Uruguay from 1911 to 1915. However, it is essential to keep in mind that he also held the office from 1903 to 1907, and his achievements during both terms have left a lasting impact on the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

Question: What is Haeckel unsuccessful in creating? Movie title: Haeckel's Tale Movie plot: Beginning[edit] The story, set in the late 19th century, begins with a young man named Edward Ralston (Steve Bacic), coming to an old woman, Miz Carnation, who lives in an old cabin deep in the woods of upstate New York. Ralston asks Miz Carnation, a necromancer, to revive his recently deceased wife; she refuses, but then decides to tell him the story of Ernst Haeckel, and says that, if he still wishes to revive his wife afterwards, she will do as he asks. Main story[edit] The story mainly concerns Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), who is trying to follow in the footsteps of Victor Frankenstein, but is unsuccessful with his attempts to create life. He learns of Montesquino, a necromancer, but believes that the man is a charlatan. Learning of his father's ill condition, he travels and encounters Walter Wolfram (Tom McBeath) and his wife Elise (Leela Savasta). Haeckel is oddly drawn to Elise and vice versa. Wolfram seems undisturbed by the attraction but when unearthly shrieks echo outside, Elise is drawn to them. Haeckel also notices that Elise is caring for a baby. Elise finally goes outside and the despondent Wolfram notes that he can't satisfy his wife, although he has sold everything he has to take care of her. Haeckel goes after Elise and follows the shrieks to a nearby necropolis. There he discovers that Elise is having sexual consort with her dead husband and the other resurrected corpses. Wolfram has paid Montesquino to raise the dead so that they can satisfy Elise. When Wolfram tries to take her home, the corpses kill him. Haeckel confronts Montesquino and demands that he make it stop. The necromancer says that he cannot, and an angry Haeckel shoots him as he tries to escape. The dying Montesquino shoves Haeckel into a tombstone, knocking him out. The next morning, Haeckel wakes up and returns to the cabin, where he finds Elise nursing the baby: a corpse-child, the son of her \\"true\\" husband. The baby rips out Haeckel's throat.

However, we can analyze the review and understand what the reviewer feels about the movie. The review begins by stating that it's \\"a very good movie,\\" which indicates that the overall quality of the film met or exceeded the reviewer's expectations. This suggests a well-executed story with strong directing and possibly a compelling narrative. The next part of the review praises the acting as \\"great.\\" This is a key element in any film and can carry a lot of weight in determining a movie's success. Exceptional acting can make a good movie into a great one by elevating the story and creating a believable and engaging atmosphere for the viewer.

Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr. (May 27, 1911 - January 13, 1978) was an American politician who served as the 38th Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969. He twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 1971 to 1978. He was the Democratic Party's nominee in the 1968 presidential election, losing to Republican nominee Richard Nixon. Humphrey and his running mate, Ed Muskie, who had not entered any of the 13 state primary elections, went on to win the Democratic nomination at the party convention in Chicago, Illinois even though 80 percent of the primary voters had been for anti-war candidates, the delegates had defeated the peace plank by 1,567 3/4 to 1,041 1/4 . Unfortunately for Humphrey and his campaign, in Grant Park, just five miles south of International Amphitheater convention hall (closed 1999), and at other sites near downtown Chicago, there were gatherings and protests by the thousands of antiwar demonstrators, many of whom favored McCarthy, George McGovern, or other \\"anti-war\\" candidates. These protesters - most of them young college students - were attacked and beaten on live television by Chicago police, actions which merely amplified the growing feelings of unrest in the general public. Humphrey's inaction during these activities along with President Johnson and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's behind the scenes convention influencing, public backlash from securing the presidential nomination without entering a single primary, as well as Humphrey refusal to meet McCarthy half way on his demands, resulting in McCarthy's lack of full endorsement of Humphrey, highlighted turmoil in the Democratic party's base that proved to be too much for Humphrey to overcome in time for the general election. The combination of the unpopularity of Johnson, the Chicago demonstrations, and the discouragement of liberals and African-Americans when both Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated during the election year, were all contributing factors that caused him to eventually lose the election to former Vice President Nixon. Although he lost the election by less than 1% of the popular vote, 43.4% for Nixon (31,783,783 votes) to 42.7% (31,271,839 votes) for Humphrey, with 13.5% (9,901,118 votes) for George Wallace, Humphrey carried just 13 states with 191 electoral college votes. Richard Nixon carried 32 states and 301 electoral votes, and Wallace carried 5 states in the South and 46 electoral votes (270 were needed to win).

Now, bizarrely, a few drops of the first of these are coming up for sale at auction next month. A phial containing traces of Churchill’s blood, drawn from the former prime minister as he recovered in hospital from a fractured hip, is being offered for sale to the highest bidder. Churchill was treated in the Middlesex hospital in London in 1962 at the age of 87 after breaking his hip while in Monte Carlo, Monaco. It was feared that he would not survive but he soldiered on until the age of 90. The blood taken at the Middlesex was about to be disposed of when a student nurse called Patricia Fitzgibbon asked if she could keep the tube, which was clearly labelled with Churchill’s name. She was given permission and kept it for the rest of her life. Now it is being put up for auction following her death. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Timothy Medhurst of Duke’s auction house with the phial of Winston Churchill’s blood. Photograph: Deep South Media Timothy Medhurst, of Duke’s auction house in Dorset, said experts had estimated the lot at £300-£600. He said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history. “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market. This year marks the 50-year anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and, as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.” The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial. In 2010 she recalled that, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay. She said: “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers, which he had specially delivered. He habitually smoked cigars in bed … [and] regularly mixed the first and second courses of his meal into one bowl before eating it.” The auction will take place at Duke’s of Dorchester in Dorset on 12 March. ||||| A few drops of blood taken from Sir Winston Churchill as he recovered with a broken hip are going under the hammer. The sample was collected in 1962 when the ‘blood, toil, tears and sweat’ orator was at The Middlesex Hospital being treated for a fractured hip. Student nurse Patricia Fitzgibbon asked if she could keep the small glass tube that was labelled ‘Sir Winston S Churchill WWB9’, and her request was granted. Following her death it is now being put up for sale at Duke’s of Dorchester in Dorset on March 12. In 1962, Churchill, aged 87, was on holiday in Monte Carlo when he reportedly fell out of his bed, fracturing his hip. He was flown back to London in an RAF VC10 jet at the request of the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. He spent several weeks recovering in the Woolavington Wing for private patients at the hospita, when the phial of blood was taken. His recovery was slow as he contracted bronchitis and pneumonia which in turn led to thrombosis. It was widely anticipated that he would not survive the ordeal at his advanced age. The blood was about to be thrown away when nurse Fitzgibbon was given permission to keep the 7cm-long tube. In 2010 she remembered how, despite the severity of his injury, Churchill remained steadfast throughout his stay. She said: “While the ward sister generally kept nurses out of his room, I did have occasional duties to carry out. “I remember that he would never settle at night until after he had read the first edition of all the daily newspapers which he had specially delivered. \\"He habitually smoked cigars in bed … [and] regularly mixed the first and second courses of his meal into one bowl before eating it!” The blood – taken three years before Churchill’s death – is going under the hammer with an estimate of £300-600. Timothy Medhurst from Duke’s said: “It is impossible to put an accurate estimate on this unique piece of history. “There are just a couple of drops in the phial that is clearly labelled. “At the time this blood was taken Churchill had already experienced a catalogue of injuries. “So to have another devastating injury occur at such an old age was a threat to his stalwart ‘British Bulldog’ image. “Though Churchill largely relied on his walking stick by the time this broken hip occurred, the operation to fix the fracture would have a caused a shortening in his leg and photographs following 1962 always show Churchill leaning on his iconic walking stick. “This injury was also at a poignant moment in Churchill’s personal life – his beloved poodle Rufus II died whilst he was in hospital recovering. “The blood will be sold together with a signed declaration by Patricia Fitzgibbon detailing the circumstances in which she acquired the phial. “It is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill’s history has been offered on the open market. “This year marks the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death. The blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill and as such, we expect there to be great interest in it. It could sell for thousands.” On May 10, 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister and when he met his Cabinet on May 13 he told them: “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.” He repeated that phrase later in the day when he asked the House of Commons for a vote of confidence in his new all-party government that would stand up to the Nazi aggressors. Also in the sale are a set of Churchill’s ‘The Second World War’ books, which he has inscribed as a gift for Mabel Johnson, who worked with Lady Spencer Churchill during the war. These have an estimate of £4,000-8,000.

In the 18th century, the course in North Yorkshire became one of the biggest and most celebrated attractions in the racing calendar with a prize of 100 guineas or more. This large ‘double gilt’ cup was – by tradition – paid for by general subscription and the worthy gentleman of the town with the silversmith being ordered to ‘make the best cup he can for 100 guineas’. The cup would generally weigh one hundred ounces or more. Subsequent cups were based on Adam’s original design and in the hands of the most eminent silversmiths, they evolved over the decades. This example is engraved on the rim ‘Richmond 1802’ and also engraved with the names of the stewards, Charles Brandling and Timothy Hutton. In addition, it is engraved ‘MAKEPEACE, FECIT’ on the rim of the lid.

A couple accused of kidnapping of two Amish girls in upstate New York last month was indicted on federal sex exploitation charges Thursday. Nicole Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells II, 39, were named in a five-count indictment in Syracuse. The charges included conspiracy to sexually exploit the two Amish girls along with a third female minor, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian. Howells also was charged with possession of child pornography. The pair had previously been charged with the kidnapping of the two Amish girls -- ages 6 and 12 -- about 50 miles from the Canadian border on August 13. \\"This indictment charges Howells and Vaisey with enticing and coercing children to engage in sexual conduct and making a video recording of it,\\" Hartunian said in a statement. Vaisey and Howells both face a maximum of 30 years in prison on the sexual exploitation charges against children. Howells faces a maximum of 20 years on the child pornography charge. If convicted, both could be fined up to 250,000 on each count. The pair also faces criminal court charges of first-degree kidnapping after luring the young Amish girls into a car with a puppy, authorities in New York's St. Lawrence County said. Details about the abduction in Oswegatchie emerged during a preliminary hearing in St. Lawrence County in August. Detective Sgt. Brooks Bigwarfe detailed the couples' alleged plan and kidnapping of the girls, as related to him by Vaisey. Vaisey told investigators that she and Howells were on a \\"shopping trip\\" for \\"slaves\\" when they allegedly kidnapped the girls. \\"They had been planning this for several weeks,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were picked up at a vegetable stand outside a family farm. Howells and Vaisey pulled up to the stand in a location where they couldn't be seen, and waited for the girls to approach the car, Bigwarfe said. Howells allegedly scouted out the stand the previous week. Howells asked the girls whether they wanted to pet the dog, a Doberman pinscher-golden retriever mix named Kaleidoscope, police said. When the older child grew suspicious, Bigwarfe said, Howells pushed the girls into the back of the car. \\"When he started forcing them into the vehicle, they were both screaming and yelling,\\" Bigwarfe said. The girls were held captive for nearly 24 hours, during which they were handcuffed together, shackled to a bed and sexually abused, according to the sheriff's department. With widening media coverage, a large police response in the area and an Amber Alert, the couple began to worry and decided it was too risky to keep the girls, he said. Howells abandoned the two girls in an isolated area 12 miles from where they were being held, Bigwarfe said. Attorneys for Vaisey and Howell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. After her August arrest, Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, told CNN that his client was allegedly in a master-slave relationship with Howells and that she was not the mastermind of the planned kidnapping.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (Financial Times) -- The Philippines would strongly support a rearmed Japan shorn of its pacifist constitution as a counterweight to the growing military assertiveness of China, according to the Philippine -foreign minister. \\"We would welcome that very much,\\" Albert del Rosario told the Financial Times in an interview. \\"We are looking for balancing factors in the region and Japan could be a significant balancing factor.\\" The unusual statement, which risks upsetting Beijing, reflects alarm in Manila at what it sees as Chinese provocation over the South China Sea, virtually all of which is claimed by Beijing. It also comes days before an election in Japan that could see the return as prime minister of Shinzo Abe, who is committed to revising Japan's pacifist constitution and to beefing up its military. The attitude towards Japanese rearmament in the Philippines, itself colonised by","completion":"Japan during World War II, has shifted significantly in recent years. This change can be attributed to growing concerns over China's expansionist policies and military assertiveness in the region. As the Philippine foreign minister suggests, a stronger and more proactive Japan could serve as a stabilizing force and provide a much-needed balance to China's growing influence. The Philippine government's embrace of such a notion indicates its willingness to put aside historical grievances and prioritize regional peace and stability. This decision is likely driven by the desire to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity amidst ongoing disputes with China over the South China Sea. Moreover, the upcoming election in Japan and the potential return of Shinzo Abe to the position of prime minister adds another layer of complexity to the situation. With Abe's commitment to revise Japan's pacifist constitution and strengthen its military capabilities, the Philippines finds itself in a position where it must align its strategic interests with the evolving dynamics of the region. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage is to highlight the shifting attitude of the Philippines towards Japanese rearmament due to concerns about China's military assertiveness, the necessity for a regional balance of power, and the changing political landscape in Japan. The Philippines is willing to support a rearmed Japan to ensure regional stability and safeguard its own interests, even if it means risking disagreements with China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence compares the speaker (\\"I\\") to the listener (\\"you\\") using the phrase \\"as much of a man as you are,\\" which allows a comparison to be drawn between the two people. Additionally, the term \\"my dear\\" is functioning as an address or a term of endearment, which is grammatically and semantically appropriate. Step 3: Check if the sentence follows proper syntax and word order. The sentence \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear\\" follows a proper syntax and word order, with the subject, verb, and object placed appropriately, and the comparative phrase \\"as much of a man as you are\\" is well-constructed. Conclusion: The sentence \\"I'm as much of a man as you are, my dear.\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Therefore, the correct answer is: b. acceptable"},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you're given a context passage.

His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games. - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins . - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.

Article: Should we be afraid of sharks ? Maybe not. New research into the reasons for shark attacks suggests that sharks don't like the way humans taste! In fact, most people who are attacked by the shark are still alive after receiving only one bite . Why is this? There are many opinions to explain why sharks sometimes attack people. One opinion is that sharks are just curious . We know that sharks are the strongest animals in their environment, so they are not afraid of anything. Naturally, that means they are curious when they meet something unusual. Because they don't have hands or feet., the only way they can find out an object is to bite it! It is thought that sharks sometimes bite humans for this reason, and then swim away. Scientists also say that sharks would not waste energy trying to eat a human, as we have a lot of bones . It is hard for a shark to eat us because sharks don't have hands, and they can't pull the meat off our bones. Maybe that's why they only bite us once. Unluckily, one bite from a large shark is serious enough to hurt people greatly! Another opinion is that sharks attack humans by mistake. Some sharks may sometimes mistake humans for a seal. An example of this is when a shark attacks a surfer. A surfer lying on a surfboard looks like a seal when seen from below. Sharks like seals because they have thick fat. Whatever the reason for shark attacks on humans, sharks should be afraid of us. Sadly, we kill almost 40 million of them each year.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: It's not always possible to dispose of food immediately, such as if garbage collection is weekly. Leaving it in the garbage until then can generate smells, attract animals, and breed flies. Ideally it should be made of glass, such as a pickle or spaghetti sauce jar, with a tight-fitting lid. Plastic jars can also be used, but may leak some odor. Sealable metal cans, such as coffee cans, can be used, but may create a rust ring if left in sink. Cardboard containers, like the cylinders oatmeal comes in, should be avoided. They may leak when they get wet from decomposing food. Ideally the jar should be small enough for a single use. Don't reopen it later, as this will let odor and potentially flies or fruit flies out, unless it has been kept frozen. (It's also possible to dump the contents in the garbage and then rinse and reuse the slop jar, but this is messy, and should be done outside.) This will halt the decomposition process and kill any insects or larva. This method can either be used in conjunction with a slop jar, or else large items, like a watermelon rind, can be placed in the freezer whole. However, it's easy to forget these items on garbage day, so a Post-it note on the trash can is a good reminder.

On 4/29/14 in the late evening, I was dismayed to discover a scorpion on the back deck of the house we had just moved into days before. I have a young daughter and a small dog and scorpions greatly concern me. We had asked the landlord about scorpions prior to signing anything and it was claimed that there were no scorpions. Of course, we live in the desert so I took this claim with a grain of salt. On the morning of 4/30/14, I began my search for a reputable pest company that could help me with my problem.

Background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Paragraph: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn?

Continuation: Jason ended up getting drenched in the rainstorm, his clothes clinging to his body as torrents of rainwater poured down on him. Nelson, on the other hand, was relatively dry, the thick animal hides of the teepee protecting him from the worst of the downpour. As the rain continued to pelt down, Jason grumbled to himself in discomfort. He tried seeking shelter under a nearby tree, but that proved to be no help whatsoever. The wind had picked up, and the rain was now coming at him sideways. Eventually, Jason could bear it no longer and shouted for Nelson to let him in.

Write highlights for this article: Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was \\"negligible\\" and an \\"extremely low level.\\" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said. See a timeline of the sub's movements ». The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing 70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane. Question: suppose more water vapor is collected happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If more water vapor is collected in the atmosphere, it will likely lead to MORE POWERFUL hurricanes. The reason for this is that hurricanes draw their energy from the warm, moist air that rises from the ocean surface. Specifically, the heat energy from the evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the hurricane's development and intensification. In the process you described, several thunderstorms come together and form around an area of low pressure to create a tropical cyclone or hurricane. The energy from the continuous evaporation of warm ocean water fuels the storm and allows it to continue developing. As more water vapor is added to the atmosphere, the potential energy for hurricane formation and intensification increases. This additional water vapor can cause hurricanes to become more intense and powerful due to the increased energy available to them. Regarding the second effect you mentioned, which is the area of low pressure causing rotation, the increased presence of water vapor may not have a direct impact on the rotation process. The rotation of the storm is mainly influenced by the Earth's rotation and the Coriolis effect, which is not directly affected by the amount of water vapor present. However, the intensified storm due to more water vapor could lead to stronger winds, indirectly enhancing the rotation process. In summary, the presence of more water vapor in the atmosphere can lead to more powerful and intense hurricanes, but it may have no direct effect on the area of low pressure causing rotation. The perturbation's indirect influence on the second effect can lead to stronger winds, enhancing the rotation process but not directly affecting the low pressure itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Iron in a circular motion with a dry, hot iron for 5 seconds. Using a paper towel apply a small amount of olive oil to the white, cloudy spot just heated. Repeat both steps until the white, cloudy spot is completely removed from the wooden furniture. This method makes more sense for accomplishing the goal of removing cloudy, white spots from wooden furniture, as it involves using heat to break up the moisture trapped within the finish that causes the white, cloudy appearance, and then applying a small amount of olive oil for rejuvenating the wood. First, by placing a pressing cloth over the cloudy spot, you are providing a protective layer between the furniture's surface and the iron. This helps prevent any direct heat damage to the wood. Ironing in a circular motion for 5 seconds allows for even distribution of heat over the area, effectively raising the temperature throughout the spot. This will cause the moisture trapped inside the finish to evaporate, thus removing a significant part of the cloudy appearance. Once the area has been heated, applying a small amount of olive oil with a paper towel helps to recondition the wood and replenish any natural oils that may have been lost during the heating process. This step helps to restore the wood's natural luster and provide a protective layer, which can prevent future cloudy spots from forming. Repeating the process of heating and oiling will gradually help to remove the entire cloudy, white spot from the wooden furniture. It also allows you to monitor the progress and ensure that you're not causing any harm to the furniture. Consequently, this method is a sensible approach to removing cloudy spots from wooden furniture, ensuring a gentle yet effective treatment for the affected area."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? My friends and I visited Las Vegas for the first time the week of 6/30 through 7/7. We decided that Saturday night we would enjoy a fine dining experience and then see what the nightlife had to offer. We got dressed and headed out to the strip sometime around 7PM. After debating on where to eat we settled on Giada (she is my partner and I's favorite chef after all!). We were all dressed in appropriate attire, however at the reception desk we were treated as though we had walked in wearing flip-flops and tattered shorts. We made our way up the escalator and I approached the desk. A young dirty-blonde haired woman greeted me and I stated that I had a party of 6 and we wished to have dinner. She started to say \\"Oh I\\"m sorry but we...\\" At that moment another blonde haired woman (slightly older) literally nudged her with her elbow and said \\"be nice\\". She then preceded to ask me if I would perhaps like to see the menu before we were seated. Essentially she was insinuating that we obviously could not afford a meal there and looked the part to boot. I was infuriated, however being the opposite of what hey assumed I was I played along and agreed to see the menu. We were then whisked away on a tour of the kitchen area and finally seated. The drink menu was very unique (based on Giada's father's favorite films), I had a Hannibal which was great and my partner had the Barbarella (his favorite film) which was equally refreshing. We ordered Giada's favorites and calamari for the table as the antipasto, spaghetti and tortellini for the pasta and shared the porterhouse steak with a side of polenta. The food was amazing just as we expected, however the treatment by the staff left a sour taste in our mouths. There were other patrons sitting near us wearing shorts and t-shirts whom I am sure were not treated as we were. The main reason in my opinion is because we mostly looked Hispanic unlike the fairer skinned individuals who were poorly dressed. While the food was amazing, we will not be visiting Giada again.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choices: [i] no; [ii] yes;","completion":"[i] no; While both questions are related to the concept of improving intelligence, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question inquires about the relationship between exercising (presumably physical exercise) and intelligence, while the second question focuses on mental math as a means to exercise the brain and improve general intelligence. To address the first question, numerous scientific studies have shown that engaging in regular physical exercise can have a positive impact on cognitive function and overall intelligence. Some of the benefits of exercise are more immediate, such as improvements in memory, attention, and problem-solving skills, while others develop over time, such as increased neural connections and enhanced neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections). Physical exercise has been shown to increase the production of hormones such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a critical role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. Additionally, exercise improves blood flow and oxygenation to the brain, contributing to better cognitive function. Furthermore, exercising also helps reduce stress and anxiety levels, which may lead to improved mental clarity and focus. Overall, a consistent exercise routine can positively influence brain health and cognitive abilities, thereby making a person \\"smarter\\" to some extent. Regarding the second question, mental math can indeed help exercise the brain and improve cognitive skills. Mental math challenges the brain to make calculations and solve problems in one's head, without external tools such as paper or calculators. This process requires the brain to engage in various cognitive functions, such as working memory, attention, and concentration. Practicing mental math can improve one's numerical abilities, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, engaging in consistent mental math exercises can support the development of memory, attention, and reasoning abilities, leading to an overall improvement in general intelligence. However, it is important to note that mental math is just one aspect of cognitive training. Balance and variety in cognitive exercises help ensure overall mental development. As such, engaging in a range of brain activities, including the arts, puzzles, reading, and learning new skills, can contribute to a more well-rounded improvement in general intelligence. In conclusion, while both physical exercise and mental math can have positive effects on cognitive function and general intelligence, these two questions focus on different aspects of intelligence improvement and are not simply paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the speaker is clearly expressing their belief that the people of Libya hold a strong devotion to their religious beliefs, and that these beliefs form a central part of their cultural identity. This commitment to faith in God is so deep-rooted that nothing else besides God has the power to instill fear or inspire reverence in them. The phrase \\"only worships God\\" signifies that the people of Libya are devoted to their faith and would not indulge in worshipping other deities or symbolic figures. This unwavering loyalty to their religion can be seen as an essential aspect of the Libyan national identity, as well as an important guiding force within their society. The phrase \\"fears only God\\" further emphasizes the importance of religious faith in Libyan culture. In this context, fear should be interpreted as a form of respect or awe, rather than a negative, paralyzing emotion. It means that the people hold God in such high regard that they consider Him as the ultimate authority in their lives and the only being truly worthy of their fear or veneration.

Once the butterfly has successfully pumped blood into its wings, gaining enough strength to enable flight, it takes off in search of several resources it needs for sustenance and reproduction. Some key activities that the butterfly engages in as part of its adult life include: 1. Feeding: Adult butterflies mainly feed on nectar from flowers, which serves as an essential energy source for activities such as flying, reproducing, and even thermoregulation. They may also consume other sources of nutrients like fruit juices, tree sap, or even dissolved nutrients from animal manure or carcasses. 2. Mating: One of the primary goals of the adult butterfly is to find a mate to continue the life cycle and ensure the survival of the species. Mating rituals can vary between different butterfly species. In many cases, males will use their vibrant wing color patterns to attract females, and the butterflies may engage in courtship dances or flights. After a successful mating, the female butterfly will carry fertilized eggs and start looking for suitable host plants to lay the eggs on. 3. Migration: Some species of butterflies, such as the Monarch butterfly, undertake a remarkable migration journey of thousands of miles, in search of ideal conditions to feed and reproduce. These migrations can span multiple generations as they fly to find their breeding grounds, spend the summer breeding, and then journey back to their overwintering sites. 4. Thermoregulation: Butterflies are ectothermic animals, which means that they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature. Adult butterflies need to maintain an optimal internal temperature to fly and perform other essential activities. They may engage in basking, where they spread their wings and orient themselves towards the sun to absorb heat, or find shade to cool down when the temperatures are too high. 5. Predator avoidance: Butterflies face numerous dangers during their adult life, including predators like birds, spiders, and other insects. They have evolved various strategies to avoid becoming prey, such as toxic chemicals or warning coloration to deter predators or even mimicry to camouflage with their surroundings. Once the adult butterfly has accomplished its primary objectives of feeding, mating, and, in some cases, migration, the butterflies reach the end of their life cycle. The next generation of butterflies is born when the fertilized eggs hatch, entering the metamorphic process, ultimately resulting in a new lineage of adult butterflies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dies kann beispielsweise durch den Zugang zu Sprachkursen und -trainings oder durch den Austausch von Best Practices zwischen den verschiedenen Institutionen erreicht werden. Es ist auch wichtig, dass die Auswahl geeigneter zweiter Sprachen individuell auf den jeweiligen Beamten und seine Aufgaben zugeschnitten ist. In einigen Fällen kann es sinnvoll sein, auf geografische oder thematische Schwerpunkte Rücksicht zu nehmen, um sicherzustellen, dass die gewählte Sprache für den jeweiligen Tätigkeitsbereich des Beamten von besonderem Nutzen ist. Letztendlich ist das Erlernen einer zweiten EU-Sprache für EU-Beamte, die regelmäßig in Kontakt mit Bürgern aus anderen Mitgliedstaaten kommen, von großer Bedeutung. Es fördert nicht nur die Effizienz und Zusammenarbeit innerhalb der Union, sondern stärkt auch das europäische Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl und trägt dazu bei, die Distanz zwischen den verschiedenen Völkern und Kulturen Europas zu überbrücken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after \\"natural bronze\\" had come into general use[citation needed]. Bronze artifacts from the Vinča culture date to 4500 BC. Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700–3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.

A forward, he played for several clubs including Liverpool and Hamburger SV. He went on to manage Newcastle United, Fulham and Manchester City, winning promotion as champions in his first full season at all three clubs. He also managed the England national team. After weeks of speculation, Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life. He led the team to a winning start with 3-1 victory over Poland to reignite England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, and they entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2-0 win in the first leg, and despite a 1-0 defeat in the second leg, they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts). After an initial popular period as manager, he began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3-2 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2-0 lead after 17 minutes. A 1-0 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, cost their opposition (the defending champions) progression to the quarter-finals, but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3-2, this time after taking a 2-1 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over. Keegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000, after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium, before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager - although unlike Don Revie (1974-1977) or Steve McClaren (2006-2007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England. When Sven-Goran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old. Keegan went on, \\"I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr Eriksson was and I'm delighted for him because that's the way it should be.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Punished how?","completion":"In the above article, the quote referring to punishment is in the context of Glenn Hoddle's controversial newspaper interview.

The Telegraph reports Idaho teen Erik Finman, after dropping out of high school, made a bet with his parents that if he made 1 million by the time he turned 18, he wouldn't have to go to college. \\"I won the million dollar bet,\\" Finman triumphantly tweeted Tuesday. Finman's journey to teenage millionaire started with 1,000 his grandma gave him when he was 12. He invested the money in bitcoin—which then cost 12 each—and by 2013, his bitcoins were worth 100,000, CNBC reports. Finman cashed out some of his bitcoins to start online teaching company Botangle, for which an investor gave him another 300 bitcoin. Flash forward to 2017, and Finman's 403 bitcoins have a value of 1.09 million. Finman left school because he thought it was a waste of time and his teachers were too negative.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"And\\" can be translated in Czech as \\"A\\". Note that the capitalization is not necessary in this context, as the sentence translation assumes a conversational context. The capitalization of \\"A\\" in the translation is used for clarity purposes only. 2. \\"a saga\\" refers to a long narrative, usually a story about the history or the heroic achievements of a certain person or a group. The Czech word for \\"saga\\" is \\"sága\\". 3. \\"shield\\" can be translated to Czech as \\"štít\\". It refers to a protective piece of armor, traditionally carried by warriors, that serves to deflect or absorb the impact of blows, projectiles, or other forms of attack. 4. The word order in Czech sentences may sometimes be different than in English. In this case, the word order of the translated phrase is \\"A štít ságy?\\", which corresponds to \\"And a shield of saga?\\" in English.

However, the pocket watch can be more than just an exquisite accessory; it can also be an ingenious tool for keeping your essential notes close at hand. Don't believe us? Here's a simple hack that could change the way you view pocket watches forever. Step 1: Choose the Right Pocket Watch To maximize the functionality of this hack, you need to select a pocket watch that comes equipped with a lid. The lid serves as a protective cover that conceals your notes while ensuring that your timepiece remains a discreet and stylish accessory. Additionally, the lid enables you to retrieve your notes without drawing undue attention to yourself – an invaluable quality for those who might be accessing their notes in formal or social settings. Step 2: Prepare Your Notes Identify the information you want to have readily available and jot it down on a piece of paper. Given the compact size of a pocket watch, we recommend keeping your notes concise and to-the-point. Alternatively, you can use abbreviations, symbols, or even a unique code system to ensure that your notes will fit comfortably within the watch's dimensions. Step 3: Attach the Notes to Your Watch After you've prepared your notes, cut the paper to fit the inside of the pocket watch's lid. Using a small piece of clear tape, affix the note to the watch's interior surface, ensuring that it lies flat and unobtrusive. Remember to avoid obstructing the watch's hands or mechanism, as this could potentially damage your timepiece. Step 4: Become an Expert at Checking the Time – And Accessing Your Notes With your notes securely in place, you can now access them discreetly by pretending to check the time on your pocket watch. Hold the watch naturally, perhaps even slightly cupping it in your hand, and glance at your notes as if glancing at the time. By maintaining a calm and collected demeanor, you'll avoid arousing suspicion while simultaneously having your essential information at your fingertips. Conclusion The humble pocket watch may have lost some of its popularity and practicality with the advent of modern smartwatches, but it still stands as a symbol of elegance and refinement. By adding this simple hack, you can transform your pocket watch into a functional and clever tool that combines the best of old-world charm and modern innovation.

Q:Question: how the capital of brazil, brasilia was created I found the following answer on Google: However, as a metropolitan area , it ranks lower at sixth in population. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, that answer does not correctly describe how the capital of Brazil, Brasília, was created. Let me give you a detailed answer. The idea of building a new capital for Brazil had been considered since the country's independence in 1822, primarily to promote the development of the interior and to reduce the country's coastal concentration. In the late 1950s, Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek decided to move forward with constructing a new capital to achieve these goals. The location for Brasília was chosen through a wide national competition, with the winning proposal situated in the Central Plateau region of Brazil. The city was designed by renowned Brazilian architect and urban planner Lúcio Costa and prominent architect Oscar Niemeyer, who was responsible for designing many of the city's signature buildings. Construction of Brasília took place at a rapid pace, officially starting in 1956 and being completed by 1960, when it was inaugurated as the country's new capital. The city was designed in a modernist style with a unique layout resembling the shape of an airplane or bird, consisting of various \\"sectors\\" designated for specific purposes, such as residential, commercial, and government areas. As for the population, Brasília currently ranks as the fourth-largest city in Brazil. However, as you mentioned, it has a lower population ranking when considering the metropolitan area, placing sixth in the country. In summary, Brasília was created to promote the development of Brazil's interior and reduce coastal concentration by establishing a new and modern capital city, designed and built with efforts led by key figures like Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Definition: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: Step 1: For each row in Tryout table, find corresponding rows in College table and in Player table. Step 2: find the average HS in the results of step 1 whose state equals no Output:","completion":"To accomplish this task, you can use the following SQL statement: \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(Tryout.HS) AS average_HS FROM Tryout JOIN College ON Tryout.college_id = College.id JOIN Player ON Tryout.player_id = Player.id WHERE College.state = 'no'; \`\`\` Explanation of the SQL statement: 1. I used the \\"SELECT\\" statement followed by the aggregate function \\"AVG\\" to calculate the average of the \\"HS\\" column in the Tryout table. 2. I used the \\"FROM\\" statement to specify the main table, which is the Tryout table in this case. 3. I used the \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the College table using the condition \\"Tryout.college_id = College.id\\". 4. I used another \\"JOIN\\" statement to join the Tryout table with the Player table using the condition \\"Tryout.player_id = Player.id\\". 5. I used the \\"WHERE\\" statement to filter the results based on the condition \\"College.state = 'no'\\".

To do that, we need to subtract 1219 from both sides of the equation: 78*u = 3949 - 1219 Now, subtract: 78*u = 2730 We're almost there!

(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. \\"Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,\\" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, \\"intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,\\" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. \\"The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,\\" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. \\"In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,\\" he said.

Valerio Olivera began his youth career at Real Madrid, one of the most successful football clubs in the world, which indicates he exhibited a talent for the sport from an early age. His professional career began in 1995, a career that would span over a decade. During this time, he moved between multiple clubs, starting with Real Poli Ejido in 2001. In 2002, he transitioned to Madrid Hércules and stayed there until 2003. Over the next four years, from 2003 to 2007, he played for Albacete Betis Elche. For the portion of the year 2007, the data doesn’t provide information on his involvement with any club. Moving to 2008, he had another stint with Elche, lasting until 2011. Furthermore, he had brief periods at Tenerife in 1996 and Almeria from 1996 to 1997. Proving his dedication to the defensive side of the game, the record shows he did not score any goals throughout his professional career. This is not surprising, though, as goalkeepers rarely had opportunities to score. In terms of caps, the data indicates Valerio Olivera played 56 times for Real Poli Ejido, then 16 times for Madrid Hércules. After that, he made 35 appearances for Albacete Betis Elche. During his period at Elche, he made 38 initial appearances, but following his return in 2008, he demonstrated a significant rise in appearances with 97 caps. He had only 4 appearances for Tenerife and made 69 for Almeria. Overall, the information suggests a seasoned goalkeeper who had a long career with various Spanish clubs.

Background: Sir David Frederick Attenborough (UK: ; born 8 May 1926) is an English broadcaster and naturalist. He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Context: Attenborough was born in Isleworth, Middlesex (now part of west London), but grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal. He is the middle of three sons (his elder brother, Richard, became an actor and director and his younger brother, John, was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo), and the only surviving child among them. During World War II, through a British volunteer network known as the Refugee Children's Movement, his parents also fostered two Jewish refugee girls from Europe. Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones and other natural specimens. He received encouragement in this pursuit at age seven, when a young Jacquetta Hawkes admired his \\"museum\\". He also spent a considerable amount of his time in the grounds of the university, and, aged 11, he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered via his father to supply for 3d each. The source, which wasn't revealed at the time, was a pond less than five metres from the department. A few years later, one of his adoptive sisters gave him a piece of amber filled with prehistoric creatures; some 50 years later, it would be the focus of his programme The Amber Time Machine. In 1936 David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was \\"bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day.\\" In 1999, Richard directed a biopic of Belaney entitled Grey Owl. Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and then won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in 1945, where he studied geology and zoology and obtained a degree in natural sciences. In 1947 he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In 1950 Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel; she died in 1997. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology for the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra. Susan is a former primary school headmistress.

(Published Friday, May 15, 2015) According to investigators, one of the victims was bleeding from the head and had a heavy smell of gasoline when he or she was transported to Georgetown University Hospital. There's also evidence that points to arson. D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said the fire is being investigated as \\"suspicious,\\" and the deaths are being investigated as a homicide arson. ATF agents, evidence collectors and police investigators are working both inside and outside of the house. Investigators are also looking for information about a 2008 blue Porsche 911 with D.C. license plates DK 2418. The car was seen near the house about 10:30 a.m. Thursday. Police found the car — torched and unoccupied — in the parking lot of St. Christopher's Episcopal Church in Lanham, Maryland, about 5:15 p.m. Thursday. They want to know more about who was driving it earlier that day. Anyone with information should call police at 202-727-9099. Victims Found in Burned D.C. House Identified Police identified the people found dead in a house that suspiciously caught fire in an expensive D.C. neighborhood Thursday afternoon. Darcy Spencer reports. (Published Friday, May 15, 2015) Police said they will check surveillance video from cameras in the neighborhood. At least two cameras are visible outside the Savopoulos' home. Neighbors who've been in the home said the family had an extensive and valuable art collection, which was on display a couple of years ago during the Christmas house tour put on by St. Albans school, where Phillip was a student. There is no sign of forced entry into the home, police said. The fire took about 30 minutes to extinguish. ||||| D.C. police and D.C. Fire officials comb the scene at the 3200 block of Woodland Drive NW, where four people were found dead at a house fire. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) When Debra Masser spoke to her brother Savvas Savopoulos by phone Thursday morning, the chief executive and father of a prominent local family seemed to be untroubled and in good spirits. But hours later, Savopoulos, his wife and two others authorities believe are the couple’s young son and their housekeeper were found dead by firefighters who battled a blaze at their Northwest Washington home. Police on Friday continued to try to piece together what happened to the well-liked family, even as the mystery around the case deepened. D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said that the fire at the stately home on Woodland Drive NW was intentionally set, that three of the victims inside had wounds, and that the family’s Porsche 911 was found torched in a church parking lot in Hyattsville, Md. The deaths shocked family, friends and neighbors, who said they had seen nothing amiss with the five-member clan in the days and weeks before the fire. Some gathered to mourn at Washington National Cathedral, while investigators continued to pore over the charred red brick home. “I can’t even express my sorrow,” Masser said. “I can’t even say anything.” Savvas Savopoulos and Amy Savopoulos at the Starlight Children’s Foundation MidAtlantic’s Wine Dinner in 2008. (Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine) Lanier said police had positively identified two of the dead as Savvas Savopoulos, 46, and his wife, Amy, 47. They have tentatively identified the other victims as the couple’s 10-year-old son, Philip, and a 57-year-old housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, of Silver Spring, Md. Lanier said that three victims suffered blunt-force or sharp-object wounds and that all four deaths in the upscale neighborhood near the vice president’s residence were being investigated as homicides. “Evidence collection will go on for several days,” Lanier said. “There’s still a lot more we don’t know.” Lanier renewed a call she originally made Thursday for information about the family’s blue 2008 Porsche 911, which disappeared from the home Thursday morning. She asked the public to contact authorities if anyone had seen it between Wednesday and Thursday at 5 p.m. — a longer time frame than authorities had initially requested. Lanier declined to explain why investigators now wanted to know about the car’s whereabouts a day earlier. The Porsche was found burning in Prince George’s County on Thursday evening, Lanier said. Prince George’s County Fire spokesman Mark Brady said firefighters extinguished the fire about 5:30 p.m. behind a church at 8201 Annapolis Rd. in Lanham, Md. Lanier said it was unclear who had been driving the vehicle. Lanier said there was no evidence to suggest random or forced entry into the Savopouloses’ home but asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious in the area to call police. Asked whether the house had been ransacked, Lanier said it was “difficult to make that determination” because of the fire. Authorities have been going through the home to try to determine whether anything was stolen, according to two officials with knowledge of the case. Police say three of the four victims found in a burning Northwest D.C. home on Thursday suffered blunt force or sharp object wounds. Their deaths are being investigated as homicides. (WUSA9) The Savopouloses are survived by two teenage daughters, who friends said were at their boarding schools Thursday. Abigail Savopoulos is a senior at Mercersburg Academy, an elite private school in Pennsylvania, and is scheduled to graduate next week. Her younger sister, Katerina, is a junior at Peddie School near Princeton, N.J. Philip was a student at St. Albans School in the District. Neighbors said the family had lived on the block for more than a decade. They described the community as tightknit and said the Savopouloses were an integral part of it. They regularly held gatherings at their home for neighbors and friends. They attended church at the nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral for about 10 years. Coco Palomeque, a friend who lives in the neighborhood, said the Savopouloses were “a beautiful family.” “The community where they lived really loved them,” she said. Savvas Savopoulos was the president and chief executive of Hyattsville-based American Iron Works, which played a role in building Verizon Center and ­CityCenterDC. His Facebook page says he also worked for Sigma Investment Strategies in Puerto Rico. American Iron Works officials declined to comment. Amy Savopoulos was widely known as a deeply involved mother who spent much of her time volunteering at her children’s schools or raising funds for them. On her Facebook page, her daughter Abigail posted a tribute on Mother’s Day: “I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you for always believing in me and supporting me. Thank you for the early morning crafts, upside down clowns on my birthday, gingerbread decorating parties, and for always showing up. . . . Thank you for the past 19 years and I look forward to the many more to come. I love you so much.” About 180 people gathered to mourn the family Friday afternoon in a lower-level chapel at Washington National Cathedral. The 30-minute service included prayer, singing and periods of silence. Many who had come were struggling not only with what happened, but also with how to discuss it with their children, said the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who helped lead the service. “When people grieve, they want to be with other people,” Budde said. “Everyone is really sad, and really shocked.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has known the family for more than 20 years, said in a statement that he was saddened. Savvas Savopoulos raised money for Van Hollen’s campaigns. “My heart goes out to the Savopoulos family at this time of unspeakable tragedy,” the statement read. “They were an important part of the community and will be deeply missed.” As friends and relatives grieved, investigators wearing yellow hard hats walked in and out of the gutted Savopoulos home. Yellow police tape still blocked off sections of Woodland Drive and 32nd Street NW, and a large ATF explosives and fire investigation vehicle was parked out front. Joe Carregal, a neighbor, said he saw the fire unfold Thursday. About 1:15 p.m., he said he saw smoke pouring from the upper-story windows of the home and a man knocking on the front door in an attempt to get the family out. Soon after, fire trucks came roaring down the street. Firefighters broke windows on the house, deployed ladders and clambered onto the roof to extinguish flames. Carregal said he watched them pull three victims from the house. Chris Vorobek, who lives in the neighborhood, said he would see Amy Savopoulos, walking her dog in the neighborhood, and her son racing around on his bicycle. “He was a great kid,” Vorobek said. Keith L. Alexander, Lynh Bui, Alice Crites, Abigail Hauslohner, Peter Hermann, Roxanne Roberts, Valerie Strauss, Julie Tate and Clarence Williams contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"On Thursday, a fire broke out at the house owned by Savvas and Amy Savopoulos in the upscale Woodley Park neighborhood of NW Washington D.C., where four bodies were later discovered.

This implies that the surfer is actively riding a wave which is a crucial part of the sport. On the other hand, \\"A surfer is paddling in flat water.\\" suggests that the surfer is simply paddling in calm, flat water where no waves are present. This situation could occur when a surfer is waiting for a wave to pick up, or in a location where no waves are forming.

Process: - Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands - Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed. Question: suppose a time of heavy daily rain happens, how will it affect fish will die faster. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"More Effect. To understand the impact of heavy daily rain on the acid rain process and its subsequent effects on fish and soils in trees, let us first break down the process mentioned. 1. Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands: Acid rain is caused when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere from activities such as burning fossil fuels and industrial processes. These pollutants combine with water vapor and other atmospheric elements to form acidic compounds like sulfuric acid and nitric acid. 2. Makes water acidic: When these acidic compounds fall to the ground with precipitation, they lower the pH of surface waters, such as lakes, rivers, and streams. This causes the water to become more acidic. 3. Kills fish: As the pH of the water decreases, certain fish species begin to struggle to adapt to the changing environment. They may suffer from physiological stress or even die off, as their gills and other organs can be damaged by the acidity. Furthermore, the increase in acidity can lead to the release of toxic substances, such as aluminum, which can be lethal to fish. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acid rain has a significant effect on soil chemistry as well. When it seeps into the soil, it removes essential nutrients such as calcium and magnesium and replaces them with hydrogen ions. This makes the soil more acidic and reduces its ability to support plant growth. As a result, trees may become weak and vulnerable to stress, disease, and pests. 5. Leaves are also harmed: The effect of acid rain on leaves is related to the damage done to the soil by acid rain. Nutrient deficiencies will affect the tree's ability to produce healthy leaves, which can then make the tree more susceptible to stressors such as harsh weather, disease, or pests. Now, if we introduce heavy daily rain into this scenario, it will have the following effects: 1. Increased acid rain deposition: With more rain, there is an increased probability of acid rain being deposited onto water bodies and soil. This could lead to a faster accumulation of acidic compounds in these environments. 2. Quicker change in water acidity: Heavy daily rain will make water bodies become acidic more quickly, as it introduces a higher concentration of acidic compounds in a shorter period. Greater volumes of acidic water will pose a higher risk to fish populations. 3. Accelerated impact on fish: As the water bodies become more acidic at a faster rate, fish mortality rates may also increase. As the pH levels drop, there will be less time for fish to adapt or seek out less acidic environments. Consequently, fish populations will experience increased stress and will likely die off more rapidly. 4. Perturbation influence on soil: Heavy daily rain will also result in more significant soil acidification, which will further damage tree health. Soil nutrient depletion will happen more quickly, thus affecting tree growth and resilience. In conclusion, heavy daily rain has a more significant effect on the second outcome mentioned in the initial process - fish death - as well as on the other outcomes, such as soil acidification. Therefore, the supposed perturbation will have a more detrimental impact on the entire ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"An independent review is being launched to examine why so many children in care in England and Wales end up in the criminal justice system.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Connections: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Youth in Care and Their Journey into the Criminal Justice System Introduction In England and Wales, it has become increasingly apparent that there is a concerning trend among children in care who later end up in the criminal justice system. As social workers, educators, and policymakers struggle to identify the root causes and implement necessary reforms, an independent review has been launched to examine the underlying reasons for this phenomenon. The review aims to shed light on why so many youths, who should be receiving support and care from the state, ultimately end up in the criminal justice system. The Importance of Understanding the Issue It is crucial to understand the factors involved in the link between children in care and their eventual involvement in criminal activities. Identifying and addressing these factors can help reduce the number of youths entering the criminal justice system and ensure that they receive the support they need to lead productive lives. The independent review will assess the mechanisms currently in place for children in care, such as foster care, residential care, and adoption services, to determine whether these strategies effectively prevent young people from turning to crime. Furthermore, the review will explore the effectiveness of current intervention and support strategies aimed at tackling the root causes of criminal behavior among these youths. Factors Contributing to the Problem Several factors potentially contribute to the increased risk of youths in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Some of these factors may include: 1. Trauma and mental health: Many children in care have experienced traumatic events that can lead to emotional and mental health challenges. These challenges may make them more vulnerable to involvement in crime. 2. Lack of stability: Frequent changes in living arrangements and support systems can disrupt a child's ability to form healthy relationships and develop stable routines. In turn, this lack of stability can lead to behavioral issues and an increased likelihood of criminal activity. 3. Limited support and resources: Many children in care lack the necessary support from social workers, educators, and other professionals who could help them overcome their challenges. The overall lack of resources and personalized support may exacerbate their problems. Review Process and Anticipated Outcomes The independent review team will comprise experts from a wide range of fields, including social work, psychology, education, and criminal justice. They will gather data through various sources, such as interviews, surveys, and case studies, to better understand the issue and formulate recommendations for improvement. The anticipated outcomes of this review include: 1. Identifying key areas of improvement: The review will pinpoint the gaps in the current care system and develop a clear understanding of which aspects should be improved to better support youths in care. 2. Formulating recommendations: Based on the findings, the review team will outline specific recommendations, including policy changes, funding priorities, and improvements in care practices, to help reduce the likelihood of children in care becoming involved in criminal activities. Conclusion As a society, it is our responsibility to ensure that all children are provided a safe, nurturing environment to grow and thrive. The independent review is a crucial step towards understanding the complex interplay between the care system and youth involvement in criminal activities. By identifying shortcomings and designing targeted interventions, we ultimately aim to break the cycle that leads so many youths in care to the criminal justice system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona decided to find out. The adventurous senator took a vacation from Capitol Hill and went on a fourday Robinson Crusoe style holiday with his two teenage sons to a remote, deserted island in the North Pacific Ocean. The senator and his sons, 15yearold Tanner and 13yearold Dallin, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to the island of Biggarenn. They didn't carry any food or water. The island is part of the Marshall Islands. It offered no basic supplies, so the Flakes had to catch and cook their own food and purify their water. Their diet was made up of coconuts, crabs and fish. They caught the crab and fish themselves and cooked the food over an open fire started with a magnifying glass . The Flakes brought along a lobster trap in the hope of having some delicious treats, but lost it within the first few hours after it was attacked by a shark. They also carried two pumps to remove salt from ocean water. It took them hours each night to pump for just a few gallons of fresh water. One of the most memorable moments of the trip, the father said, was when he and his 15yearold son were almost caught by sharks after spearing a fish in the ocean. Still, it was quite an enjoyable holiday for them. \\"For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no disturbance, no texting,\\" Flake recalled.

City were dominant and two clinical counter-attacks led to Kelechi Iheanacho and Raheem Sterling tap-ins. Ilkay Gundogan calmly slotted in a fourth but City had Nolito sent off late on for an attempted head-butt. The Spaniard was involved in a clash with Adam Smith and, while any contact with his head looked slight, referee Jon Moss had little option but to dismiss the winger. Relive Manchester City's win over Bournemouth Follow action and reaction to Saturday's games City's passing and movement was a joy to watch and the influential De Bruyne was at the heart of their play. The Belgian midfielder, who scored in the win over against Manchester United last week, played behind main striker Iheanacho and caused Bournemouth all sorts of problems as he was involved in all his side's goals before going off to a standing ovation. De Bruyne's absence for two months last season was a huge setback for City as they dropped from second to fourth in the Premier League, and from three points behind leaders Leicester to 15. The 25-year-old's intelligence, running with the ball and vision made him a constant threat and his link-up play with Sterling, Nolito and Iheanacho left Bournemouth bemused. \\"The performance from Kevin was terrific, amazing,\\" said City boss Pep Guardiola. \\"He is on another level. He is a fantastic player and helps us a lot.\\" Sterling did score a hat-trick against the Cherries at the Etihad last season but, for most of the campaign, was a subdued presence following his £49m move from Liverpool. However, the 21-year-old appears to be back to his livewire best as he closely pushed De Bruyne in the man of the match stakes. The dribbling skills and pace that make him such a threat were impressively on show against Bournemouth and he has clearly benefited from the arrival of Guardiola. The City boss phoned Sterling during the summer before officially taking over to tell the winger he was a big part of his plans, and the Spaniard looks to have restored his confidence. Apart from his goal, and his assist for Iheanacho, Sterling also went close when he dispossessed Charlie Daniels on the right flank, producing a mesmerising run across the Cherries box - past a host of defenders - before seeing his shot hit the post. Overall, Sterling has now had a hand in eight goals in his seven appearances for Manchester City this season, scoring three and assisting five. Like his team, Wilshere looked out of his depth on a chastening afternoon for both as he made his first start of the season following his loan move from Arsenal. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe replaced striker Callum Wilson, who scored the winner against West Brom last week, with the England man to reinforce his midfield, but the move did not pay off. Wilshere clumsily shoved Nolito off the ball to concede the free-kick from which City scored their opener and the 24-year-old struggled to have an impact on the game. The visitors were also guilty of giving the ball away too cheaply and, although Josh King's pace did cause City some moments of concern, they rarely had the ball long enough to use that as a weapon. Bournemouth, who saw Wilson's shot hit the crossbar, had 35.7% possession in the match. \\"It was difficult for Jack in the first half, because he's at his best when he has the ball, and we didn't have too much of it,\\" said Howe. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \\"Our high pressing was not perfect today - we had problems with controlling the Bournemouth build-up, but we created a lot of counter-attacks. On the sending off of Nolito: \\"The referee took a decision and we have to accept that.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \\"It was a tough day.

Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

Article: When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table. Talking to your children over dinner is the best way of having their-trust. Children learn good eating habits from their parents at a very young age. Family meals are important. Prepare them for your children. Question: Children who often eat with their families _ .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The £10m device was lifted into place at the new Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) at the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH). A giant crane eased the 18-tonne scanner down an alleyway with inches to spare on each side, then through a hole in the wall of the new building. Once it is installed and calibrated it will be used to research - and help treat - a variety of conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In its current condition it looks like a space capsule - a huge, upended metal doughnut with a hole where the patient will go. And like many a space shot it is a thing of superlatives. There is enough wire wrapped around its huge magnets to stretch from London to Brussels. When it is operating, those magnets - but not the patient - will be cooled to minus 269 Celsius. That is the temperature of deep space. So this particular corner of Glasgow will become one of the coldest places in the universe. The unit of strength of a magnetic field is a Tesla (T), named after the Serbian-American pioneer Nikola Tesla. The magnetic fields of the MRI scanners currently in use in Scotland range from around 1.5T to 3T. The new scanner's field strength will be 7T. Or to put it another way, 140,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of planet Earth itself. The head of Glasgow University's College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak, sees it as an endorsement of the pioneering work already done there. \\"Glasgow is a centre of excellence for chronic disease research and management, and also for clinical trials,\\" she says. \\"So as a leader in this area we think we are the best to get a 7 Tesla scanner.\\" With that field strength will come more detail than existing scanners. Much more. It has been likened to going from an ordinary TV picture to HD. That added detail will mean far greater opportunities to research and teach - and to treat patients from the QEUH campus with new precision medicine techniques. MRI scanners may seem new-fangled to many of us. If so, we are just showing our age. Glaswegians have been getting scanned for more than 30 years now. If we ourselves haven't been scanned, chances are we know someone who has. But do we know what's going on in there? Happily the university's professor of clinical imaging, Keith Muir, can explain. \\"Essentially we're using a very strong magnetic field which is going to line up all the water in your head in one direction,\\" he says. \\"And then by applying clever radio pulses it's going to spin them round in various ways that can be detected as very small radio signals which are used through vast computing power to reconstruct a detailed picture of the bit we're imaging.\\" As with many big ticket science projects, collaboration and co-funding are key. The university is taking the lead, in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. The ICE which now houses the scanner is costing £32m, with money coming from the UK government's Medical Research Council, the European Regional Development Fund, The Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. The scanner's proper name is the Siemens Magnetom Terra. It will take months to set up but once the electrical and civil engineering are over, the science can begin.

It's as if you were watching a fuzzy TV, and then suddenly the picture became very sharp and clear. Once the machine is set up, doctors will use it to study and treat different illnesses – such as strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy – more precisely than ever before. That's because the machine can take really detailed pictures of what's going on in people's bodies. The MRI scanner might look like a space capsule right now, but that's because it's so big and heavy. There's also a lot of wire—enough to stretch from London to Brussels! And the machine is going to be extremely cold, colder than any place outside in space, but don't worry, people inside the machine won't feel cold. Lots of important science organizations and charities are helping to pay for the new scanner and the building where it will be put.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Given the background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. and the situation: Barry and Will are two geologists.

As a geologist specialized in montology (study of mountains), his expertise is focused on the formation, structure, and evolution of mountains, rather than on seafloor spreading and subduction zones.

As such, we cannot claim that the premise \\"Children are performing a routine on stage\\" is true based solely on information about children swimming in a pool. To say the premise is true, we would require additional information indicating that these children are indeed performing a routine on a stage. For example, it could be possible that the children are participating in synchronized swimming—an organized routine performed in a pool. In this case, we may consider the pool as a stage for this specific type of performance, thus making the premise true. However, with the current information given, we cannot safely say that the premise is accurate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Obama: Qaddafi Needs To Leave Now Speaking out against Muammar al-Qaddafi for the first time, President Obama said on Saturday the Libyan leader needs to \\"leave now,\\" having lost the legitimacy to rule. In a White House statement on Obama's telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Obama took his most direct position yet on the escalating violence in Libya. \\"The president stated that when a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now,\\" it said. Obama's stance comes after he signed an executive order Friday freezing assets held by Qaddafi and four of his children in the United States. The Treasury Department said the sanctions against Qaddafi, three of his sons and a daughter also apply to the Libyan government. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced further sanctions Saturday, revoking visas for senior Libyan officials and their immediate family members. She said future applications from those blacklisted for travel to the United States would be rejected. Qaddafi \\"should go without further bloodshed and violence,\\" Clinton said in a separate statement. Obama has been conferring with world leaders about the unrest in Libya. The administration is hoping that the world speaks with a single voice against Qaddafi's violent crackdown on protesters, and Obama is sending Clinton to Geneva on Sunday to coordinate with foreign policy chiefs from several countries. The U.N. Security Council met urgently Saturday and voted unanimously to impose new sanctions against Libya. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wants immediate action to protect Libyan civilians. The U.N. chief was due in Washington on Monday for talks with Obama at the White House. The administration had been facing increasing pressure to more forcefully condemn Qaddafi and explicitly call for his ouster, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done. Witnesses in Libya said Qaddafi is arming civilian supporters to set up checkpoints and roving patrols in Tripoli, the capital. The U.S. held back, but its tone shifted sharply on Friday after Americans in Libya were evacuated to safety by ferry and a chartered airplane. Shortly after, Obama signed an executive order outlining financial penalties designed to pressure Qaddafi's government into halting the violence. The order said that the instability in Libya constituted an \\"unusual and extraordinary threat\\" to U.S. national security and foreign policy. A nonviolent revolt against Qaddafi's government began Feb. 15 amid a wave of uprisings in the Arab world. Most of Libya's eastern half is under the control of rebels. Witnesses say Qaddafi's government has responded by shooting at protesters in numerous cities. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Space optimization: Placing the floor lamp in a corner allows James to optimize the space utilization, as corners are usually less occupied and underutilized. Moreover, it doesn't obstruct the walking path or any other activities. 2. Illumination distribution: Placing the floor lamp in a corner helps to evenly distribute the light across the room. As the lamp is situated at an angle to the walls, the emitted light will be reflected and scattered throughout the space, creating balanced and adequate illumination. 3. Aesthetic appeal: Positioning the floor lamp in a corner can accentuate the overall interior design and ambiance of the room. The lamp will not only provide a functional purpose but also serve as a decorative element, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. 4. Avoiding clutter: Compared to the other alternatives, like the desktop or next to the bed, placing the floor lamp in a corner can minimize the risk of creating clutter in those busier areas and will keep the room looking more organized.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife? The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

This change had left him slightly uneasy, as he had always relied on his trusty personalized helmet to give him a sense of comfort and confidence on the field. Step 1: The athlete needs to adjust his mindset about the helmet situation Justification: It's important for him to remain positive and focus on his performance rather than stressing about external factors beyond his control. The athlete spent time each day during his training sessions consciously working on his mindset, reminding himself that his skills and abilities mattered far more than the specific helmet he wore. He also reminded himself that all his rivals were in the same situation, giving him no relative disadvantage. Slowly but surely, his anxiety about the change in rules began to fade away.

A state investigation has found no. evidence of child abuse by a Kennedy heir who tried to take his newborn. son from a maternity ward, a family lawyer said today. Attorney Robert Gottlieb said Douglas. Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F Kennedy, received a letter from. New York's child protection agency declaring that a report of child. abuse had been determined to be unfounded. On January 7, he tried to take the. newborn boy from the maternity ward at Northern Westchester Hospital in. Mount Kisco, more than 30 miles from Manhattan. Nurses objected, and the. hospital reported the incident to the state. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas. The Office of Children and Family Services investigated after Kennedy was charged with child endangerment in February. Susan Steele, an agency spokeswoman, said today by email that confidentiality laws prohibit her from commenting. Gottlieb said the agency's. investigation is separate from the criminal prosecution and doesn't. negate the endangerment charge against Kennedy, but he hopes prosecutors. will take it into consideration. 'It is our fervent hope that the. Westchester district attorney will continue to evaluate this case, and. we remain hopeful that the DA will ultimately dismiss that charge,' he. said. Hospital: Douglas Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk outside. 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy. Gottlieb said the probe covered the hospital encounter and a home visit. 'They investigated everything,' he said. He said the agency's finding was 'the first glimmer of reason that has surfaced in this case since it erupted in the press.' The finding has nothing to do with charges of physical harassment against Kennedy stemming from the same encounter. One nurse says Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to keep him from leaving with the baby, and another says he kicked her. Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman. Luciano told MSNBC they were involved in a vicious scuffle with the 44-year-old after he tried to get in a lift with his son. Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7. Kennedy, 44, has said he was. protecting the child as the nurses tried to grab him. ‘We kept saying to him: “We need to. step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms. Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to. you. It's my child.’ Mr Kennedy claims that as he was. leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came. toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the. nurse to protect his son. That. nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of. twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to. the maternity ward rather than go outside. ‘I. still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I. wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg. up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’ Fox. News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late. politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968. ‘It is sickening to think that our. simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into. a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a. statement. Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the. district attorney, wouldn't comment. Douglas Kennedy, a reporter for Fox. News, is due in Mount Kisco Court on April 12. Mr Kennedy is the. 10th child of Ethel and Robert F.

Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

Options： A. cyanide B. love C. burial D. suicide E. murder The answer to this question is:","completion":"E. murder A person's death may not be wanted by the person themselves in the case of murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malicious intent or premeditation. In this scenario, the victim has no control over their own death, and it is not something they would typically desire or choose for themselves. The act of murder is a heinous and immoral action which often brings immense grief, pain, and loss to the victim's loved ones. Society views murder as a reprehensible criminal act, and laws exist to deter and punish the perpetrators. To further understand the given options, let's break them down: A. Cyanide: Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical compound that can cause death if ingested or inhaled in large enough quantities. While it is true that a person would not want exposure to such a dangerous substance, this particular option does not specifically indicate that their death would not be wanted by the person themselves. B. Love: Love is an intense and heartfelt emotion that we typically associate with positive feelings, such as happiness, devotion, and companionship. Although love can sometimes lead to tragic circumstances, the emotion itself does not pertain to an unwanted, untimely death. C. Burial: Burial is a traditional method of disposing of a person's remains after their death. While the process of burial relates to death, it does not imply that the person's death was unwanted or forced upon them. D. Suicide: Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Even though it is a tragic and distressing event, it is a deliberate choice made by the individual, which suggests that the person's death is not entirely \\"unwanted\\" by them in this particular moment. However, this does not mean that the action of suicide is justifiable or encouraged. E. Murder: As mentioned earlier, murder is the unlawful killing of a person without their consent, which makes it the most suitable option for answering the question. In the case of murder, the victim's death is unwanted and forced upon them, evoking feelings of anger, sadness, and injustice amongst their loved ones and the wider community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","completion":"Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. This is because Ronaldo is paying close attention to his nutrition and consuming a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol, while Jeff consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Lipids, also known as fats, play a critical role in maintaining the overall health of the body. They supply energy, support cell growth, protect organs, and help in the absorption of certain vitamins. However, as mentioned in the question prompt, consuming excessive amounts of dietary lipids can lead to undesirable health outcomes, including unhealthy weight gain. The fact that Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast means that he is likely maintaining a balanced diet, with a proper proportion of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). As a result, he is consuming sufficient energy to support his daily activities without leading to an energy surplus in his body. This energy balance reduces the chances of significant weight gain due to the accumulation of excess body fat. On the other hand, Jeff's diet, which is high in fat and cholesterol, is associated with a higher calorie intake. Given that lipids are the most calorie-dense macronutrient, providing 9 calories per gram compared to 4 calories per gram for carbohydrates and proteins, Jeff's dietary choices make it more likely for him to consume excessive amounts of energy. If he is unable to burn these excess calories through physical activity, his body will store the extra energy as fat, leading to unhealthy weight gain over time. Furthermore, Jeff's high intake of saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol can contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, directly linked to the narrowing of arteries due to cholesterol deposits. Additionally, the two roommates have a similar body structure and physical activity levels, implying that their energy requirements are relatively similar. Since Ronaldo's diet is more focused on providing the right balance of nutrients without excess, it is safe to conclude that Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Movie plot title: Demons Movie plot: On the Berlin subway, university student Cheryl gets off at her stop in the deserted subway station and is pursued by a mysterious, masked man. Rather than attacking her, the man offers her tickets to a free screening at the Metropol, an isolated and recently renovated local cinema. Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film. At the crowded theater, they meet two preppy college boys, George and Ken, who take an immediate liking to the girls and help them get a can of cola out of the vending machine. The four sit together in the theater. There are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter; an elderly married couple; a boyfriend and girlfriend; and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes, who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film is a violent, disturbing horror movie which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby. It is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called Nostradamus. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin they find no body, just an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer.

Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran.

Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws. - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934 8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council. - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\" following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.

Please answer a question about the following article about Queen (band): In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs.

Options: - blisters - frustration - being paid - making shareholders richer - making money Explain why a human would choose \\"frustration\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Frustration,\\" because people may experience several types of frustration at the office that could influence their desire not to work in such an environment. Firstly, frustration in an office setting could stem from several sources and may significantly impact an employee's job satisfaction and overall wellbeing. Here are a few reasons why working in an office can lead to frustration. 1. Hierarchical Bureaucracy: Traditionally, offices operate in a hierarchical structure, where decisions flow from the top down. This structure can frustrate employees who feel their voices, ideas, and concerns are not heard, valued, or acted upon. When there is little room for democratic decision-making or freedom of expression, employees may feel frustrated and become disengaged. 2. Lack of Autonomy: Lack of freedom and control over one's work can result in frustration. In an office, you often have to follow strict schedules, protocols, procedures, and may not get to choose the type of projects you work on, or how you want to execute them. 3. Office Politics: For many people, office politics can be draining and frustrating. It can create a negative atmosphere filled with rivalry, gossip, unfair treatment, favoritism, and power battles. It can tip the balance from meritocracy towards who can better play the political game. 4. Communication Problems: Miscommunication or lack of communication can lead to confusion, followed by frustration. In office environments, information may not always be effectively shared, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. 5. Micro-Management: Excessive micro-management often leads to frustrated employees in an office environment. Feeling constantly watched and judged can stifle creativity, initiative, and can increase stress levels. 6. Commuting: The time spent commuting back and forth can add to daily frustrations, especially for those living in large cities where traffic is a significant stressor. 7. Confinement: Being seated at a desk, in a cubicle, or in a small office for long hours can become boring and frustrate workers. It can negatively influence their physical health and motivation. In contrast, the other options \\"- blisters,\\" \\"being paid,\\" \\"making shareholders richer,\\" and \\"making money\\" are less likely to be chosen as the main reasons someone would not want to work in an office. Blisters are not a common ailment resulting from office work. Meanwhile, \\"being paid\\" and \\"making money\\" are typically considered benefits of working, not drawbacks. Although one could argue that \\"making shareholders richer\\" might cause annoyance if one values a more equitable distribution of wealth, it is not a primary source of frustration directly tied to the physical and mental day-to-day reality of the office environment. In conclusion, frustration is the most fitting answer as it encapsulates a diverse range of common pain points workers experience in office settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

Movie title: We Were Soldiers Context: A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

The Saudi Arabian government believes they can and is backing its belief by investing 22 billion into a public transport mega-project in the capital Riyadh. Set to begin construction early next year, a new metro network will encompass over 176 km (110 miles) of train lines and 85 stations, linking the city center to universities, the airport, a newly built financial district and commercial areas. The first trains as slated to run in 2019. During construction, it will be the world's biggest public transport project, employing tens of thousands of people, developers say. According to the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh, all carriages will be air-conditioned and divided into first, family and single class. Buses and trains take a distant second to personal cars in Riyadh and according to FCC Construction only 2% of commuters in the Saudi Arabian capital take public transport. It's no surprise because gasoline is highly subsidized -- a gallon at the petrol pumps costs around 0.50. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest oil producer ranks only second to Venezuela for the world's cheapest gasoline. According to reports, the Saudi government is weighing up increasingly the cost of fuel to give public transport a boost. Read more: Ramadan's Super Bowl effect. Chronically underdeveloped until now, the expansion of public transport in the Saudi capital will also cope with the projected boom in the local population.

It may sound strange, but an egg can do wonders for your hair. The yolk nourishes your hair by adding moisture so that it doesn't look dull. The white clarifies your hair by helping to remove any buildup. The egg also has protein in it, which strengthens your hair. The result is hair that looks very shiny after just one treatment. Here's how to do it: Beat one egg in a small bowl. Wet your hair. Pour the egg over your head. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb it to the tips of your hair. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water for maximum shine. Apple cider vinegar is quickly catching on as an all-natural hair conditioner and gloss booster. It balances your hair's pH level, clarifies your strands and leaves your hair feeling soft. Once your hair dries, it will no longer smell like vinegar. Follow these steps to make an ACV treatment: Shampoo your hair as usual, but skip the conditioner. Pour a mixture of 1 tablespoon ACV and 1 tablespoon water over your head. Comb it through to your tips. Very long hair may require 2 or 3 tablespoons. Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water at the end of your shower. Avocado has natural fats that nourish your hair and add shine. Using a ripe avocado will make it easier to spread the mixture into your hair. Try an avocado mask when your hair is dry and in need of a moisturizing boost. Mash an avocado until smooth. You can also use a blender to process it. Wet your hair. Spread the avocado from your roots to your tips. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water. Honey attracts moisture and has clarifying properties. This combination makes it perfect for adding shine to dull hair. Raw honey is the most nourishing, but any type of honey works fine. To make a honey mask, Mix 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup warm water. Wet your hair. Comb the mixture into your hair. Let it sit for 15 minutes or more. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water. If your hair isn't shiny because it's dry, dull and frizzy, a deep conditioning treatment should put things right. You can get a store-bought deep conditioner or make your own using coconut or olive oil. Once a week, follow these steps to deep condition your hair: Wet your hair. Comb 1 to 3 tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil from your roots to your tips. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap. Let it sit for up to 30 minutes. Shampoo your hair. You may need to wash it two or three times to remove the oily residue. Rinse with cold water.","completion":"This article highlights various natural treatments, including egg, apple cider vinegar, avocado, honey, and deep conditioning, to enhance hair shine and nourishment."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Bulgarian language.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". By the time of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts.

Born in Carlton, England, on March 8, 1905, Nicholls held the position of goal keeper, renowned for his considerable height of 6 feet 4 inches, which was instrumental in his career on the playing field. His early career is marked with some blanks, but his first recorded professional engagement was with Darlaston, with the number of matches he played there remaining unknown. After this, Nicholls moved on to Northfleet United, where the number of matches he played also goes unreported. The later parts of his career were more well-documented. In 1936, he joined Tottenham Hotspur, where he played for three years until 1939. During his stint with Tottenham Hotspur, he made an impressive 124 appearances. After his tenure with Tottenham Hotspur, Nicholls switched alliances to Bristol Rovers. With Bristol Rovers, he made 112 appearances, showing a consistent show of skill and resilience that undoubtedly made him a distinguished goalkeeper of his time. Despite his active career in football, Nicholls was not known for scoring goals; he maintained a record of zero goals throughout his professional life. This was likely due to his position on the playing field. Nicholls lived until the age of 68, passing away on June 20, 1973, in Nottingham, England.

Q: Abstract: BACKGROUND A major challenge for physicians is to identify patients with acute coronary syndromes who may benefit from treatment with glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists. We investigated whether troponin concentrations can be used to stratify patients for benefit from treatment with tirofiban. METHODS We enrolled 2222 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management study with coronary artery disease and who had had chest pain in the previous 24 h. All patients received aspirin and were randomly assigned treatment with tirofiban or heparin. We took baseline measurements of troponin I and troponin T. We recorded death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischaemia after 48 h infusion treatment and at 7 days and 30 days. FINDINGS 629 (28.3%) patients had troponin I concentrations higher than the diagnostic threshold of 1.0 microg/L and 644 (29.0%) troponin T concentrations higher than 0.1 microg/L. 30-day event rates (death, myocardial infarction) were 13.0% for troponin-I-positive patients compared with 4.9% for troponin-I-negative patients (p<0.0001), and 13.7% compared wth 3.5% for troponin T (p<0.001). At 30 days, in troponin-I-positive patients, tirofiban had lowered the risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.25 [95% CI 0.09-0.68], p=0.004) and myocardial infarction (0.37 [0.16-0.84], p=0.01). This benefit was seen in medically managed patients (0.30 [0.10-0.84], p=0.004) and those undergoing revascularisation (0.37 [0.15-0.93] p=0.02) after 48 h infusion treatment. By contrast, no treatment effect was seen for troponin-I-negative patients. Similar benefits were seen for troponin-T-positive patients. INTERPRETATION Troponin I and troponin T reliably identified high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes, managed medically and by revascularisation, who would benefit from tirofiban..

Oscar \\"Manny\\" Manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, the doors to Manny's cell were welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive and sadistic Associate Warden Ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. Manny intends to break out a third time with his older brother Jonah, but he is forced to set his escape plan into action in the middle of winter after Ranken employs a serial killer to stab him. Jonah stabs his attacker to death in retaliation and in turn is severely beaten by a prison guard, leaving him in a high-security hospital wing. Manny has to leave his brother behind. He recruits Buck McGeehy, who was convicted of statutory rape and who works in the prison's laundry room, to smuggle him out in a trolley. Buck decides to join Manny in the escape, even though Manny wants to go it alone.

Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium. As a consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair, so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. Notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. Troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular function is compromised.. Title: Activation of fast skeletal muscle troponin as a potential therapeutic approach for treating neuromuscular diseases Output:","completion":"yes I used the definition given in the abstract to determine that the title is right for the article as the abstract explains how the fast-skeletal-troponin activator, CK-2017357, is developed for increasing muscle strength in neuromuscular diseases. The title, \\"Activation of fast skeletal muscle troponin as a potential therapeutic approach for treating neuromuscular diseases,\\" accurately represents the content of the abstract by focusing on the activation of fast skeletal muscle troponin as a potential treatment for neuromuscular diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \\"Scarface\\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \\"American Dream\\". Anybody complaining about the \\"cheesiness\\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another. The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa. Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \\"Scarface\\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10 What is the sentiment of this review? Choices: (1). negative.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was developed by the federal government as a segregated community?, using the article: The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive., what would be the answer ?

At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, a manager who gave his name as \\"Ben W.\\" said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. \\"It's getting more people on the road, more people learning about the sport and getting involved,\\" he said. An employee at Danny's Cycles in Gramercy said Citi Bike is a good option for people in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. \\"They can try out a bike without buying one:' James Ryan said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles. But for Frank's Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St., the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said that his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was launched last month. Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes. However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. \\"People have used the bike-share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,\\" he noted. Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. said at first he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, \\"I was happy to see people on bikes.\\" Farrell's early concerns were repeated by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. \\"It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to put into use:' Crooks said of Citi Bike.

Context: The first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis. In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm in 1263 and in 1265. Question: Who raided Cumberland and Kuyavia? Answer:","completion":"Herkus Monte, a Prussian leader, raided Culmerland (not Cumberland) and Kuyavia with a large force in 1263.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The solid body electric guitar that the Gibson Robot Guitar was based on was introduced in the early 1950s. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the origins and development of both the solid body electric guitar and the Gibson Robot Guitar, let's explore the historical context and innovations that led to these instruments. The solid body electric guitar can be largely attributed to inventor and musician, Les Paul. In the late 1940s, Les Paul experimented with a solid body design built from a wooden plank with strings and a rudimentary pickup. This creation, often referred to as the \\"Log,\\" laid the foundation for the solid body electric guitar. The fundamental principle of the solid body was to diminish the effects of resonance, which would reduce feedback and improve the guitar's overall performance. After a few years of designing and refining the concept, the Gibson Guitar Corporation, an iconic American guitar manufacturer, approached Les Paul to collaborate on producing a line of solid body electric guitars. In 1952, the Gibson Les Paul Model was introduced, which had a single-cutaway mahogany body, a carved maple top, and two P-90 pickups. It is considered one of the first solid body electric guitars that gained mainstream popularity. The Gibson Les Paul marked the beginning of the evolution of the solid body electric guitar. Other models, such as the Fender Telecaster (1950) and the Fender Stratocaster (1954), soon followed, further expanding the realm of electric guitars and transforming the music industry. Fast forward to 2007, the Gibson Robot Guitar was developed as an adaptation of the classic Gibson Les Paul. This innovation brought in cutting-edge technology to the already well-established solid body electric guitar. The Gibson Robot Guitar incorporated next-generation features, such as automatic tuning and intonation adjustment, bringing a new level of precision and ease of use to guitar players. In conclusion, the solid body electric guitar was introduced in the early 1950s, with the Gibson Les Paul Model being one of the key pioneers which eventually led to the development of the Gibson Robot Guitar. This impressive fusion of traditional solid body electric guitar design and modern technological advancements revolutionized the way musicians interact with their instruments and establish new standards for performance and convenience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Campaigners set up camp at Upton, near Chester, in April 2014 to prevent testing by energy company IGas. In November, they were served with a court order compelling them to leave the site. Cheshire Police said two men had been arrested for \\"obstructing police\\" and another for \\"obstructing the highway\\". A man and woman were arrested for obstructing a high court officer, while another man was arrested for \\"failing to comply with a Section 35 notice\\", a spokeswoman said. Another man was arrested for police assault, another for aggravated trespass. She added that more than 20 dispersal notices had been issued. The BBC's Cheshire political reporter Phil McCann said about 30 protesters had been at the camp but all protesters had been evicted. Supporters had entered an adjacent field but bailiffs ushered them out and police escorted them away. Camp resident Phil Whyte, who was there since the day it was set up, said he had left of his own accord, because he was \\"cold, tired and worried about my cat\\". Bailiffs, supported by police from Cheshire and North Wales, arrived at the site at about 10:00 GMT to begin the eviction process. A woman was treated at the scene by paramedics at 12:28 GMT and declined to be taken to hospital, according to a spokesperson for the North West Ambulance Service. For the first two hours, there was a stand-off between the bailiffs, police and protesters - then we saw the first arrest as a man was carried horizontally through a field. After seven hours of action the camp was quiet by 17:00 GMT, when the last of the protesters was taken down. He was arrested, but many others left of their own free will. It's clear the campers didn't manage to resist for as long as they may have hoped, but their 20-month stay is meant to serve as a serious deterrent to any companies wanted to frack. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said the force expected a \\"protracted\\" operation and closed Duttons Lane, which leads to the camp. She added that officers were \\"monitoring the situation and ensuring public safety\\". Since being served the eviction notice, the protesters constructed an elaborate series of fortifications, including a network of tunnels, walls and a moat to try to prevent their removal. Frack Free Dee Coalition said protesters would take \\"peaceful direct action\\" and would do \\"everything we can to defend ourselves\\".

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - A rookie is a person in his or her first year of a sport, or someone who is new to a profession, training or activity such as a rookie police officer, rookie pilot, a recruit, or occasionally a freshman. - The Tampa Bay Buccaneers (often shortened as the Bucs) are a professional American football franchise based in Tampa, Florida.

Answer:","completion":"The former professional footballer you are referring to is David Beckham, for whom the Spanish Tax Decree, also known as \\"Beckham Tax Law\\" or \\"Beckham Law,\\" was nicknamed. The law, officially called Royal Decree 687/2005, was established in Spain in 2005 as a tax incentive for foreign workers temporarily residing in Spain. It allowed them to pay taxes at a lower rate than Spanish residents, providing a significant benefit for high-income individuals such as professional footballers. David Beckham is an iconic English footballer who played as a midfielder for clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as for the England national team. He is known for his exceptional free-kick skills, accurate crosses, and bending shots. Beckham joined the Spanish football club Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003, and this Spanish tax law was introduced in 2005. His name became associated with the tax law since he was one of the first signatories of the deal and received significant media attention for taking advantage of it. This linked the tax law to Beckham in the public's mind and it eventually became popularly known as the \\"Beckham Law.\\" David Beckham retired from professional football in 2013. His last club was Paris Saint-Germain, where he played for a brief period from January to May 2013. He announced his retirement on May 16, 2013, and played his last professional game on May 18th of the same year. Throughout his illustrious career, Beckham won various titles and accolades, such as six English Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one UEFA Champions League, one La Liga title, and two MLS Cups, among others.

Answer:","completion":"Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family. In order to understand their taxonomic differences, it is essential to delve deeper into their classifications. Arenaria, commonly known as sandworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. This family falls under the order Caryophyllales. The Caryophyllaceae family comprises herbaceous plants characterized by opposite, simple leaves and small, usually white or pink flowers that form a cyme or solitary inflorescence. The genus Arenaria encompasses roughly 90 to 100 species and is mostly native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some well-known species in this genus include Arenaria montana, Arenaria serpyllifolia, and Arenaria rubra. On the other hand, Sciadopitys verticillata, commonly known as the Japanese umbrella pine or kōyamaki, is the only species in the genus Sciadopitys, which belongs to the family Sciadopityaceae. This family is under the order Pinales, which is a group of gymnosperms. The Sciadopityaceae family is characterized by distinctive whorls of evergreen, needle-like foliage. The Japanese umbrella pine is endemic to Japan, where it grows in moist, cool regions at higher elevations. It has unique characteristics, such as growing bifacially flattened shoots with leaves arranged in an umbrella-like pattern, which is the reason behind its common name. As previously mentioned, Arenaria belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family within the order Caryophyllales, while Sciadopitys verticillata is in the family Sciadopityaceae under the order Pinales. These two families belong to two different orders, and the plants themselves exhibit significantly different characteristics. For example, the Caryophyllaceae family (Arenaria) consists of herbaceous, flowering plants that typically produce small flowers. These plants are mostly found in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, the Sciadopityaceae family (Sciadopitys verticillata) has gymnosperm characteristics with evergreen foliage and is native to Japan. In summary, Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family. They belong to the families Caryophyllaceae and Sciadopityaceae, respectively, which are classified under distinct orders and possess various features that differentiate them from each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the context of these sentences, the use of \\"modernity\\" and \\"modernism\\" might be considered synonymous as both refer to the characteristics of modern music. - \\"a trial of the limits of aesthetic construction\\" vs. \\"a testing of the limits of aesthetic construction\\": The phrases \\"a trial of\\" and \\"a testing of\\" can both imply experimentation or exploration. In the context of these sentences, both phrases suggest a similar meaning, as they both refer to exploring or examining the boundaries of aesthetic construction in music. Based on this step-by-step analysis, I can conclude that the two sentences have the same meaning. They both convey that Daniel Albright is proposing a definition of modern music, which involves experimenting with or exploring the boundaries of aesthetic construction, and he presents the following modernist techniques or styles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.

Question: FINAL EXAM Question 1. Which director was politically motivated, Richard Pearce or Karel Kachyňa? Answer:","completion":"Karel Kachyňa was the director who was more politically motivated. Karel Kachyňa (1924-2004) was a Czech film director from the former Czechoslovakia. He was well-known for his works that often touched on political and social issues in his home country. His films often depicted the impact of social and political changes on ordinary people's lives. Some of his most renowned films include \\"A Report on the Party and Guests\\" (1966), \\"The Ear\\" (1970), and \\"The Little Shepherd Boy from the Valley\\" (1984). These films made pointed commentary on the political repression and totalitarianism in the Eastern Bloc countries during the mid- to late twentieth century. On the other hand, Richard Pearce is an American director and cinematographer who has directed films, TV episodes, and documentaries. Born in 1943, he is known for making narrative-driven movies that explore family-related issues, musical history, and human relationships. Some of his works include \\"Country\\" (1984), \\"The Long Walk Home\\" (1990), and \\"Leap of Faith\\" (1992). While his works may contain social and political elements, Pearce's focus does not revolve solely around political motivation as Karel Kachyňa's does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What will Others want to do next? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: go home and relax B: finish quickly C: be Skylar The answer is:","completion":"A: go home and relax The context suggests that Skylar has been waiting upon hand and foot for the people to finish working. This implies that they have been exerting effort and putting in long hours to complete their work. Therefore, it is most likely that once they finish working, they would want to go home and relax to recover from their hard work and effort. Option B - \\"finish quickly\\" - does not answer the question of what others would want to do next, as it only expresses the idea that they would want to speed up their work. This option does not give any information about their subsequent actions. Option C - \\"be Skylar\\" - is not a proper answer, as it does not relate to any possible actions that others may take after finishing their work. Instead, this option seems to imply that they would want to take on Skylar's role or become Skylar, which does not make sense in this context. Thus, option A - \\"go home and relax\\" - is the best answer according to the context provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Which process involves solvent separation on a solid medium? Choices: - substration - resonance - affinity - chromatography A: A:","completion":"The process that involves solvent separation on a solid medium is chromatography. Chromatography is an analytical technique widely used in scientific research, forensics, biotechnology, and other industries to separate mixtures of substances based on their different properties, such as polarity or molecular weight. The term \\"chromatography\\" derives from the Greek words \\"chroma\\" (meaning \\"color\\") and \\"graphein\\" (meaning \\"to write\\"), as the first chromatographic separations were based on color bands formed by colored compounds on solid support. In chromatography, the mixture to be separated is dissolved in a suitable solvent, called the mobile phase, while a stationary phase made of a solid or viscous liquid immobilized on a solid medium is used for the separation itself. The separation occurs when there are differences in the affinity between different components in the mixture for the stationary phase and the mobile phase. Compounds with greater affinity for the stationary phase will be retained longer, and thus move more slowly through the medium. In contrast, compounds with a higher affinity for the mobile phase will travel more quickly and thus separate from other components. There are various types of chromatographic techniques, each employing different stationary and mobile phases, as well as separation methods: 1. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC): Involves the use of a solid stationary phase (usually a thin layer of silica gel, alumina, or cellulose) coated on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate, and a liquid mobile phase. 2. Column chromatography: The stationary phase is typically a solid support (e.g., silica or alumina) packed within a glass or plastic column, and the mobile phase is a liquid that flows through the column. 3. Gas chromatography (GC): The stationary phase is a polymer or a solid that is coated on the inner walls of a narrow-capillary column or supported on a solid-support material, and the mobile phase is a carrier gas (such as helium or nitrogen) that flows through the column. 4. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): Similar to column chromatography but with the use of high pressure to force the mobile phase (a liquid) through a column packed with small particles of the stationary phase, which allows the separation of compounds with higher resolution and speed. 5. Ion-exchange chromatography: A type of column chromatography that separates ions based on their charge and affinity for the ion-exchange resin (stationary phase) that has charged functional groups. 6. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC): Also known as gel filtration, this type of column chromatography separates molecules based on their size and shape, using a porous stationary phase that allows smaller molecules to enter pores and larger molecules to be excluded from the pores. 7. Affinity chromatography: A selective type of column chromatography that exploits the specific interactions between molecules and a ligand immobilized on the stationary phase (e.g., antibody-antigen, enzyme-substrate, or receptor-ligand interactions) for the separation and purification of target molecules. In summary, the process involving solvent separation on a solid medium is chromatography, an analytical technique employed in various scientific fields to separate and analyze different components in complex mixtures. Several chromatographic methods exist, each tailored to specific types of compounds and separation needs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated A:","completion":"The final step in this process is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil or natural gas, as a result of the accumulation, compression, and transformation of organic matter from dead sea organisms. To elaborate, the entire process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Death and accumulation of sea organisms: The process starts with the natural death of marine organisms such as plankton, algae, and other small sea creatures. These organisms get deposited on the seafloor after their death and accumulate over time. 2. Sedimentation: As more and more organic matter accumulates on the seafloor, layers of sediment (such as sand, silt, and clay) begin to form above it. This sedimentation process can occur over a long period, encompassing millions of years. 3. Compression: As layers of sediment continue to accumulate, the weight of the overlying material increases. This increase in weight, along with the natural geological processes occurring deep within the Earth, causes the organic matter and sediment layers to experience immense pressure, leading to their compression. 4. Heat and transformation: The immense pressure and the natural heat produced by the Earth's interior result in a gradual rise in temperature within these deeply buried layers. This increase in temperature, combined with the pressure, causes the organic matter to undergo a series of chemical reactions. These reactions break down the complex organic molecules into simpler compounds, such as hydrocarbons. 5. Formation of fossil fuels: The final step of this process is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil and natural gas, which are both primarily composed of hydrocarbons. Over time, these hydrocarbons migrate to different regions, creating reservoirs of fossil fuels. The type of fossil fuel formed – whether oil or natural gas – depends on the specific conditions (temperature, pressure, and composition of the organic matter) during the compression and transformation processes. In summary, the final step of the process involving the death and deposition of sea organisms, sedimentation, compression, and heating is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil or natural gas. These fossil fuels constitute a significant source of energy and have played a crucial role in the growth and development of human civilization throughout history. However, the extraction and burning of these finite resources contribute to environmental concerns, such as air pollution and climate change, necessitating a transition to more sustainable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: For each row in election table, find corresponding rows in county table and in party table. Step 2: find Governor, County_name of the results of step 1","completion":"To accomplish the task in a single SQL statement, you can use the JOIN statement to join the election table with the county and party tables on their respective primary keys.

Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68, according to a new report from the World Health Organisation. This is six years longer than the average global life expectancy for a child born in 1990. Across the globe, life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in Iceland - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in Japan - 87. At the top end of the scale, Japanese women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87, and Iceland has the highest male life expectancy – 81. The next highest female life expectancies were in Spain (85), Switzerland (85), Singapore (85) and Italy (also 85). After Iceland, the highest male life expectancies were found in Switzerland (80), Australia (80), Israel (80), and Singapore (also 80). In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83. In the U.S. a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 and a girl can expect to reach 81. If all high-income countries are taken together, the average male life expectancy is now 76. This is 16 years more than for a boy born in a low-income country, where life expectancy is now 60. Globally, the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death are heart disease, lower respiratory infections - such as pneumonia - and strokes. Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 but life expectancies in low-income countries remain much lower than those in high-income countries. For a girl born in 2012 in a high-income country, life expectancy is 82. For a girl born in a low-income country, the figure is just 63. ‘In high-income countries, much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling non-communicable diseases [i.e. chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes],’ said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO. ‘Fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke. ‘Richer countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example.’ Declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries. However, the ‘World Health Statistics 2014’ report shows that the greatest progress was made in low-income countries where average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012. In many low-income countries female life expectancy is still held back by high rates of death during childbirth. And the greatest increases in life expectancy were in Liberia (from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012), Ethiopia (from 45 to 64 years), the Maldives (58 to 77 years), Cambodia (54 to 72 years), Timor-Leste (50 to 66 years) and Rwanda (48 to 65 years). ‘An important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday,’ says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ‘But there is still a major rich-poor divide - people in high-income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low-income countries.’ The figures also revealed that across the world women live longer than men. In high-income countries they live for an average of six years longer, and in low-income countries they live for an average of three years longer. At the bottom end of the scale, life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine sub-Saharan African countries – Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. One of the reasons that life expectancies have increased in low-income countries is that infant mortality rates fell significantly between 1990 and 2012. The WHO figures also revealed that the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease, lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – and strokes. However, globally, the greatest causes of death vary. In 22 African countries 70 per cent or more of the years of life lost due to premature death are caused by infectious diseases. In contrast, in 47 mostly high-income countries, non-communicable diseases and injuries cause more than 90 per cent of years lost. These are diseases that cannot be passed between people, such as cancer and heart disease. More than 100 countries are transitioning rapidly towards a greater proportion of deaths from non-communicable diseases and injuries. Most deaths in children under the age of five occur as a result of premature birth. The second highest cause of infant mortality is pneumonia.

His mother Got cancer at one point but it has been treated and has been eliminated. and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Which is this about? The patent office sided with the Public Patent Foundation, which argued that several examples of so-called quot;prior art quot; were in existence when Microsoft sought to patent FAT.","completion":"This case is about a patent dispute between the Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) and Microsoft Corporation regarding the File Allocation Table (FAT) technology, which is a widely-used file system developed by Microsoft. The crux of the argument revolved around the question of whether Microsoft rightfully held an enforceable patent on certain aspects of the FAT file system or if these aspects were already in existence when Microsoft applied for the patent. Background: The File Allocation Table (FAT) is a file system that was initially developed in the 1970s and has subsequently evolved over the years. It is particularly popular for its simplicity and compatibility across a wide range of devices, including personal computers, cameras, and other consumer electronics. Microsoft held several patents for the FAT file system, and one of the most notable among them was the US Patent No. 5,579,517, which covered long-filename (LFN) technology. Dispute: In 2003, PUBPAT filed a request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to re-examine the validity of Microsoft's patent on the FAT file system. PUBPAT claimed that the patent in question should not have been granted since there were several instances of \\"prior art\\" in existence at the time Microsoft sought the patent. In the context of intellectual property law, \\"prior art\\" refers to any evidence that demonstrates an invention was already known or publicly disclosed before a patent application was filed. If the presence of prior art can be established, it can be used to invalidate the patent in question. PUBPAT provided numerous examples of documents and technologies dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, asserting that these were evidence of prior art that anticipated the methods and techniques covered by Microsoft's patent. They argued that Microsoft's patent was neither novel nor non-obvious, two essential criteria that must be met for the grant of a patent. Outcome: After re-examining the patent and considering the evidence presented by PUBPAT, the USPTO sided with PUBPAT and invalidated Microsoft's patent. Accepting PUBPAT's arguments that the prior art established sufficient grounds to demonstrate a lack of novelty in Microsoft's technology, the patent office ruled that Microsoft's patent claims were unenforceable. Impact: The decision by the USPTO in this case had several implications. First, it removed legal barriers for developers and manufacturers to implement FAT file system technology freely on their devices without the fear of patent infringement lawsuits. This allowed for greater innovation and competition among device manufacturers, ultimately benefiting consumers. Second, the case illustrated the importance of ensuring that the patent system only protects truly innovative and novel inventions. When a vital technology like the FAT file system is patented and protected, it can stifle innovation and competition in the industry. By challenging and ultimately invalidating Microsoft's patent, PUBPAT showed that the patent system can be used to foster innovation by ensuring that only deserving inventions receive patent protection. Lastly, the case also demonstrated how critical prior art searches and analysis are, both for companies seeking to enforce their patents and organizations like PUBPAT seeking to challenge them. When well-documented prior art can be identified, it can play a significant role in shaping the outcome of a patent dispute and enhance the overall credibility of the intellectual property system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together. They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend had to start exercising?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the friend who had to start exercising is Tom.

Q:What is the first name of the person who army disbanded on December 20? Answer the above question based on the context below: Stephen F. Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.

The entrance to the airport is off MacArthur Blvd in Irvine, the city that borders the airport on the north and east. Newport Beach and Costa Mesa form the southern and western boundaries along with a small unincorporated area along the Corona del Mar (73) Freeway. Santa Ana is just north, not actually touching the airport. Originally named Orange County Airport, the county Board of Supervisors renamed it in 1979 to honor actor John Wayne, who lived in neighboring Newport Beach and died that year. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is santa ana the same as john wayne airport?","completion":"No, Santa Ana is not the same as John Wayne Airport. But they are closely related in a geographic sense and often confused due to their interwoven nomenclature. Santa Ana is a city in Orange County, California. The mailing address for John Wayne Airport is in Santa Ana, hence the IATA airport code SNA. However, the actual physical location of the airport is encompassed by several cities. The entrance is off MacArthur Blvd in Irvine, another city which borders John Wayne Airport to the north and east. Newport Beach and Costa Mesa are the other cities forming the southern and western boundaries of the airport. So while the airport has its mailing address in Santa Ana, it doesn't physically touch the city. John Wayne Airport was originally named Orange County Airport and was renamed in 1979 in honor of actor John Wayne, who was a resident of the neighboring city of Newport Beach. In conclusion, the names 'John Wayne Airport' and 'Santa Ana' are often used interchangeably, but they refer to distinct entities — one is an international airport and the other is a city.

What is the matching principle? What are some examples? What is Matching Principle? What are some examples of it? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"The Matching Principle is an essential concept in accounting that guides the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes. It is based on the accrual accounting method, and it states that expenses should be reported in the same accounting period as the revenues those expenses helped generate. The principle helps ensure that the financial statements provide a more accurate and consistent representation of a company's financial performance during a specific period. By matching expenses with corresponding revenues, the matching principle helps maintain the integrity and comparability of financial statements. There are several examples of the matching principle in practice. Some of the most common include: 1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): When a business sells a product, the cost related to producing or acquiring that product must be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenue from the sale. For example, if a company sells a car for 50,000 and the cost to manufacture that car was 40,000, the company recognizes revenue of 50,000 and COGS of 40,000 in the same period, resulting in a gross profit of 10,000. 2. Depreciation and Amortization: Companies typically purchase fixed assets like buildings, machinery, and equipment for use in their operations over a long period. To spread the cost of those assets over their useful life, businesses use depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is used for tangible assets (e.g., buildings, machinery), while amortization is for intangible assets (e.g., patents, copyrights). By allocating a portion of the asset's cost to each period, the matching principle ensures that the expense is recognized in correlation with the revenue generated from the use of that asset. 3. Prepaid Expenses: Some expenses are paid in advance, such as insurance premiums, rent, or subscriptions. These expenses are initially recorded as assets and then gradually expensed over the usage period. For instance, suppose a company pays a 12,000 annual insurance premium in advance. In that case, it will recognize a 1,000 expense each month for 12 months, matching the expense recognition with the passage of time and the benefit received from the insurance coverage. 4. Salaries and Wages: Employees' salaries and wages are expenses that need to be matched with the period in which they were earned. For example, if employees are paid bi-weekly, a company must allocate half of the monthly salary expense to each of the two payment periods. This ensures that the expense matches the period during which labor was provided to generate revenue. 5. Deferred Revenues: When a business receives payment in advance for products or services, it records the payment as a liability called deferred revenue or unearned revenue. As the product is delivered or the service is provided over time, the business recognizes the revenue, matching it to the expense incurred in delivering the service or product, like labor and materials consumed. Regarding your second question, the two sentences are essentially asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about the meaning of the matching principle and requesting examples of its application. Thus, the answer to your question would be option 2: yes, both sentences are essentially the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Frustration was a daily part of Robert's life and not Lawrences, since","completion":"Robert was a detail-oriented, perfectionist project manager at a prestigious architectural firm, while Lawrence was a carefree, go-with-the-flow artist who had built a name for himself in the world of abstract art. The two had been friends since their college days and happened to share an apartment in the creative district of the city. Robert's frustrations often sprang from the demands of his profession; the tight deadlines, the need for precision, and his unwavering commitment to his job. He would wake up each morning, prepared for the challenges ahead, filled with a volatile combination of excitement and dread. By contrast, Lawrence's days were filled with the freedom to express himself, the liberty to experiment, and the option to take time off without the fear of repercussions. One evening, while sharing a bottle of wine, Robert opened up about his anxieties and the incessant discontent he felt each time he couldn't meet his impeccably high standards. Lawrence listened patiently, waiting for Robert to finish, and said, \\"Life is a canvas, Robert, and you have the power to paint it with the colors of happiness, vibrancy, and peace. It's okay to take a step back and appreciate what you've created.\\" But Robert found it difficult to embrace this philosophy. He believed that success required unwavering commitment, and that letting go, even for a moment, could jeopardize his career. Unable to compromise on his beliefs, Robert allowed the frustration to fester. One day, while presenting his designs to a high-profile client, Robert cracked under the immense pressure. His hands shook and his voice wavered. He struggled to explain the intricate details of the project, and ultimately, lost the account. On the way out, the client, almost in pity, suggested that Robert should take a break and recharge before resuming his work. Crushed and heartbroken, he returned home and informed Lawrence about the incident. The artist could see the toll it had taken on his friend and decided to intervene. He knew that Robert had talent, determination, and the passion for creating incredible designs; but he was allowing stress and frustration to govern his entire existence. Over the next few weeks, Lawrence convinced Robert to undertake a transformative journey. He insisted that Robert optimize his environment at home to create a space for relaxation and creativity, as well as meditation and reflection. They explored various forms of exercise, including yoga and tai chi, to help Robert manage his stress and find a sense of balance. Lawrence also introduced him to the world of abstract art, letting his friend see the beauty in imperfection and the importance of artistic expression. Robert started dedicating time to understanding the emotional aspect of design, broadening his artistic horizons. As weeks turned into months, Robert's demeanor slowly shifted. The once-frustrated man began to find serenity in the small moments of life. He discovered that taking breaks, observing his thoughts, and combating negative self-talk could help him cope with stress more effectively. Lawrence continued to be a supportive influence in Robert's life, patiently guiding him and celebrating his transitions. Ultimately, Robert found his true passion in a more unconventional branch of architecture, fusing together the world of emotions, art, and design. Both their careers soared as their lives found equilibrium. The once-turbulent waters of their existence began to calm, the storms of frustration receding. They discovered and embraced that life is a never-ending, intricate dance between the structured world of work and the unstructured world of expression and self-growth. Robert's transformation became a testament to the fact that embracing vulnerability and seeking balance can set one free from the confines of frustration, paving the way for peace, tranquility, and personal fulfillment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Vietnam War came to an end on April 30, 1975, marked by the fall of Saigon, South Vietnam's capital, to North Vietnamese forces. This conflict followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The conclusive event was preceded by a series of key events that led to the conclusion of the war. 1. The Paris Peace Accords (January 27, 1973): The United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam reached a ceasefire agreement to stop hostilities in Vietnam. U.S. military involvement gradually decreased, and eventually, all U.S. troops were withdrawn in March 1973. This left the South Vietnamese Army to defend itself without the direct support of the U.S. military. 2. The Easter Offensive (1972): North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam in 1972. Despite initial setbacks, the South Vietnamese army, with U.S. air support, managed to halt the North's invasion. However, the offensive weakened the South Vietnamese Army's capabilities and depleted its resources. 3. Fall of Da Nang (March 1975): The capture of the strategic city of Da Nang by the North Vietnamese Army struck a major blow to South Vietnam's ability to resist, as it prompted a series of military setbacks that eventually led to the fall of Saigon. 4. Fall of Saigon (April 30, 1975): North Vietnamese forces captured the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, which marked the end of the Vietnam War. The President of South Vietnam, Duong Van Minh, announced an unconditional surrender to the North Vietnamese forces. Saigon was later renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the communist leader. The fall of Saigon marked the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule, which remains in place to this day.

(6). permineralization. (7). Air. (8). that material's properties. Answer:","completion":"(5). Mutagenic chemicals Given the two facts provided, the answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals. To properly understand how mutagenic chemicals can change the structure of nucleotides, let’s first explore what nucleotides and mutations are and then discuss the role of mutagenic chemicals in this process. A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, which make up the genetic material in living organisms – DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). These molecules are composed of three components: a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. The specific sequence of these bases in DNA and RNA forms the genetic code that dictates cell functions and the characteristics of the organism. Now let’s explore mutations. A mutation is an alteration in the sequence of nucleotides that occurs spontaneously or as a result of exposure to certain environmental factors (such as mutagenic chemicals). Mutations can be of two types: 1. Chromosomal mutations: These affect the structure of the chromosome itself, changing the arrangement and organization of genes within the chromosomes. Examples include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. 2. Point mutations: These involve a change in a single nucleotide. Examples include substitutions, insertions, and deletions of individual bases. Mutagenic chemicals (Fact 2) are substances that increase the rate of genetic mutations by altering the structure and functionality of nucleotides present in the DNA and RNA molecules. These chemicals can interact with the genetic material either directly or indirectly, causing changes in the nitrogenous bases and the DNA or RNA backbone. The mechanisms by which mutagenic chemicals cause these changes include: 1. Chemical modification of the bases: Mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds with the nitrogenous bases, resulting in altered structure and function. For example, alkylating agents can add an alkyl group to the nitrogenous bases, altering the pairing properties and leading to mistakes during DNA replication. 2. Base damage: Some mutagenic chemicals can cause oxidative damage to the nitrogenous bases, for example, through oxidation reactions (Choice 1). These reactions can lead to the formation of unstable and reactive molecules called free radicals, which can, in turn, damage the DNA base pairs. 3. Intercalation: Mutagenic chemicals can insert themselves between adjacent base pairs, causing distortions in DNA or RNA structure. This can lead to problems in processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, potentially causing frameshift mutations. 4. Crosslinking: Certain mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds between adjacent bases on the same or opposite DNA strands, leading to the formation of crosslinks that impede replication and transcription processes. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals (Choice 5). These chemicals play a significant role in inducing genetic mutations by either altering the structure of entire chromosomes or changing single nucleotides within the DNA and RNA molecules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Now he faces deportation, the New York Times reports. CBS News and a writer for the Forward note the arrest of Villavicencio, who's married to 38-year-old US citizen Sandra Chica and has two young daughters, first started making the rounds in Spanish-language media after Chica says her husband showed up at Fort Hamilton on Friday, food order in hand, and showed his IDNYC card, one often held by immigrants. Staff demanded other ID and then ran a background check, which revealed an open deportation order on Villavicencio from 2010. In a call from immigration detention, Villavicencio tells the New York Post a staff sergeant he'd delivered to before tried to intervene on his behalf, but ICE was called and Villavicencio was taken away.

When it comes to evolutionary debates, this one is a major dogfight. Since the time of Charles Darwin, scientists have argued over the origin of domesticated dogs, speculating wildly about how, when and where a toothy, flesh-eating beast was first transformed into man’s best friend. Some experts believe humans were naturally drawn to small, furry wolf pups, and seized them as novelties. Others suggest they were raised for slaughter by early agrarian societies. Yet another theory holds that early proto-dogs were enlisted as helpers by roving bands of hunters, long before humankind ever experimented with agricultural livestock. “The experts get quite exercised about who’s right and who’s wrong,” said James Serpell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “Whether that’s just scientific hubris, I don’t know.” But the epic argument over what sparked the Big Bark may finally be drawing to a close. As researchers avail themselves of faster and cheaper DNA sequencing technology, experts are zeroing in on the time and place where dogs were welcomed into human society. PHOTOS: How wolves became dogs In research published Thursday in the journal Science, evolutionary biologists analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 18 ancient dogs and wolves. Then they compared them to an array of modern counterparts, and even a few coyotes. The authors concluded that dog domestication most likely occurred in Ice Age Europe, between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago -- much earlier, and much farther north, than previously believed. Dogs, the authors argued, evolved from a now extinct species of European wolf that followed bands of nomadic or semi-nomadic humans who were hunting woolly mammoths and other large prey. Initially, the wolves sought out the carcasses and scraps of meat left behind by man, the authors suggest. Over time, these hang-around wolves began to fill a special role in human hunter-gatherer society, researchers say. “The initial interactions were probably at arm’s length, as these were large, aggressive carnivores,” said senior study author Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biology professor at UCLA. “Eventually though, wolves entered the human niche. ... Maybe they even assisted humans in locating prey, or deterred other carnivores from interfering with the hunting activities of humans.” From Europe, domesticated dogs spread across the Old World, and then to the Americas. However, the robust European wolf that got the fetch ball rolling left no other living descendants besides dogs. “Wolves living on the planet today are not the closest group to the ancestor of dogs,” Wayne said. Until recently, many archaeologists and biologists believed that dogs were first domesticated no more than 13,000 years ago, either in East Asia or the Middle East. A burial site in Israel contained the 12,000-year-old remains of an elderly man cradling a puppy. Archaeologists pointed to this find, as well as others, as evidence of a special, ancient bond between dogs and humans. Yet tracing the exact path of dog evolution has been extremely difficult. Ancient dog remains are hard to distinguish from wolf remains, and frequent interbreeding between dogs and wolves further complicate matters. Add to that mankind’s zealous breeding of the animals to enhance specific traits and behaviors and the genetic waters become very clouded. In fact, Darwin himself believed that the dizzying variety of existing dog breeds argued strongly that dogs must have had more than one wild ancestor. Genetic researchers today say this is most likely not the case, and that domesticated dogs evolved from one ancestor, in one region. “On some levels, understanding the geographic origins of dogs is definitely more difficult than studying humans,” said Greger Larson, a bioarchaelogist at the University of Durham in England. Larson, who was not involved in the Science paper, said Wayne and his colleagues had “significantly advanced” the debate over domestication.“I really like this paper,” Larson said. “Dogs have always been hard to pin down, and there have always been crazy ideas about the process and the location. But the emergence of genetic methods ... has elevated the level of discourse.” There are those, however, who argue that Wayne and his colleagues are barking up the wrong genetic tree. Peter Savolainen, an associate professor of evolutionary genetics at Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology, argues that evidence shows dogs were first domesticated in China, probably as a source of food. Savolainen points out that Wayne and his colleagues published an earlier paper citing the Middle East as the origin of domestic dogs, but have abandoned that view. “They don’t comment on that in this paper and they should,” Savolainen said. He pointed out too that the paper lacks animal samples from the Middle East or China. “The only thing you’re looking at is European and Russian samples,” he said. “What can you tell really about anything? If you only have European samples, obviously you will find that Europe is the origin.” Wayne said he and his colleagues did not include samples from those areas because they were too recent, only about 7,000 or 8,000 years old. “That’s well after dogs were domesticated, so we’re kind of limited in that sense,” he said. As for the turnabout on the Middle East hypothesis, Wayne said it was based on new genetic evidence and the realization that domesticated dogs interbreed with local wolf populations, confusing the genetic signal. “Initially, we didn’t appreciate how important that early admixture was,” Wayne said. Study authors said they hope to confirm their findings with additional testing of genetic material. This new DNA will be taken from the nucleus of ancient cells, which contain abundantly more information than DNA taken from cell mitochondria. In the meantime, experts are left to ponder this latest development, as well as the reason why scientists have argued so heatedly about the origin of dogs. “You might as well ask why,” Serpell said with a laugh. “People make up tremendously elaborate stories about the origin of our own species based on a few fossil remains here and there, or DNA from this individual or that individual. I guess we’re doing the same thing now to our dogs. ” ALSO: What is your dog really saying with a tail wag?

This wolf species was particularly large. Credit: Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences Wolves likely were domesticated by European hunter–gatherers more than 18,000 years ago and gradually evolved into dogs that became household pets, UCLA life scientists report. \\"We found that instead of recent wolves being closest to domestic dogs, ancient European wolves were directly related to them,\\" said Robert Wayne, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in UCLA's College of Letters and Science and senior author of the research. \\"This brings the genetic record into agreement with the archaeological record. Europe is where the oldest dogs are found.\\" The UCLA researchers' genetic analysis is published Nov. 15 in the journal Science and featured on the journal's cover. In related research last May, Wayne and his colleagues reported at the Biology of Genomes meeting in New York the results of their comparison of the complete nuclear genomes of three recent wolf breeds (from the Middle East, East Asia and Europe), two ancient dog breeds and the boxer dog breed. \\"We analyzed those six genomes with cutting-edge approaches and found that none of those wolf populations seemed to be closest to domestic dogs,\\" Wayne said. \\"We thought one of them would be, because they represent wolves from the three possible centers of dog domestication, but none was. All the wolves formed their own group, and all the dogs formed another group.\\" The UCLA biologists also hypothesized at that conference that a now-extinct population of wolves was more directly related to dogs. For the current study in Science, the researchers studied 10 ancient \\"wolf-like\\" animals and eight \\"dog-like\\" animals, mostly from Europe. These animals were all more than 1,000 years old, most were thousands of years old, and two were more than 30,000 years old. The biologists studied the mitochondrial DNA of the animals, which is abundant in ancient remains. (Mitochondria are tiny sub-cellular structures with their own small genome.) By comparing this ancient mitochondrial DNA with the modern mitochondrial genomes of 77 domestic dogs, 49 wolves and four coyotes, the researchers determined that the domestic dogs were genetically grouped with ancient wolves or dogs from Europe—not with wolves found anywhere else in the world or even with modern European wolves. Dogs, they concluded, derived from ancient wolves that inhabited Europe and are now extinct. Wayne said that that the domestication of predatory wolves likely occurred among ancient hunter–gatherer groups rather than as part of humans' development of sedentary, agricultural-based communities. \\"The wolf is the first domesticated species and the only large carnivore humans ever domesticated,\\" Wayne said. \\"This always seemed odd to me. Other wild species were domesticated in association with the development of agriculture and then needed to exist in close proximity to humans. This would be a difficult position for a large, aggressive predator. But if domestication occurred in association with hunter–gatherers, one can imagine wolves first taking advantage of the carcasses that humans left behind—a natural role for any large carnivore—and then over time moving more closely into the human niche through a co-evolutionary process.\\" The idea of wolves following hunter–gatherers also helps to explain the eventual genetic divergence that led to the appearance of dogs, he said. Wolves following the migratory patterns of these early human groups would have given up their territoriality and would have been less likely to reproduce with resident territorial wolves. Wayne noted that a group of modern wolves illustrates this process. The Basenji represents one of the most divergent dog lineages in existence today. Genetic analyses of modern and ancient canids, including some of the oldest known dog remains, place the origin of modern dogs in Europe between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago. Credit: Science \\"We have an analog of this process today, in the only migratory population of wolves known existing in the tundra and boreal forest of North America,\\" he said. \\"This population follows the barren-ground caribou during their thousand-kilometer migration. When these wolves return from the tundra to the boreal forest during the winter, they do not reproduce with resident wolves there that never migrate. We feel this is a model for domestication and the reproductive divergence of the earliest dogs from wild wolves. \\"We know also that there were distinct wolf populations existing ten of thousands of years ago,\\" Wayne added. \\"One such wolf, which we call the megafaunal wolf, preyed on large game such as horses, bison and perhaps very young mammoths. Isotope data show that they ate these species, and the dog may have been derived from a wolf similar to these ancient wolves in the late Pleistocene of Europe.\\" In research published in the journal nature in 2010, Wayne and colleagues reported that dogs seem to share more genetic similarity with living Middle Eastern gray wolves than with any other wolf population, which suggested a Middle East origin for modern dogs. The new genetic data have convinced him otherwise. \\"When we previously found some similarity between Middle Eastern wolves and domestic dogs, that similarity, we are now able to show, likely was the result of interbreeding between dog and wolves during dog history. It does not necessarily suggest an origin in the Middle East,\\" Wayne said. \\"This alternative hypothesis, in retrospect, is one that we should have considered more closely. As hunter–gatherers moved around the globe, their dogs trailing behind probably interbred with wolves.\\" Wayne considers the new genetic data \\"persuasive\\" but said they need to be confirmed with an analysis of genetic sequences from the nucleus of the cell (roughly 2 billion base pairs)—a significantly larger sample than that found in mitochondrial DNA (approximately 20,000 base pairs). This is challenging because the nuclear DNA of ancient remains tends to become degraded. While Wayne plans to pursue this follow-up research, he said he does not expect a nuclear genome analysis to change the central finding. However, he said, it will fill in more of the details. \\"This is not the end-story in the debate about dog domestication, but I think it is a powerful argument opposing other hypotheses of origin,\\" he said. There is a scientific debate over when dogs were domesticated and whether it was linked with the development of agriculture fewer than 10,000 years ago, or whether it occurred much earlier. In the new Science research, Wayne and his colleagues estimate that dogs were domesticated between 18,000 and 32,000 years ago.

Thalmann et al. Science, 2013. ||||| Image caption Some dog-looking remains are more than 30,000 years old The results of a DNA study suggest that dogs were domesticated in Europe. No-one doubts that \\"man's best friend\\" is an evolutionary off-shoot of the grey wolf, but scientists have long argued over the precise timing and location for their emergence. The new research, based on a genetic analysis of ancient and modern dog and wolf samples, points to a European origin at least 18,000 years ago. Olaf Thalmann and colleagues report the investigation in Science magazine. It adds a further layer of complexity to the story. Earlier DNA studies have suggested the modern pooch - in all its shapes and sizes - could track its beginnings back to wolves that attached themselves to human societies in the Middle East or perhaps in East Asia as recently as 15,000 years ago. The problem with these claims is that palaeontologists have found fossils of distinctly dog-looking animals that are 30,000 years old or more. Dr Thalmann, from Finland's University of Turku, and his team, have had another go at trying to sort through the conflicting DNA evidence. They compared genetic sequences from a wide range of ancient animals - both dogs and wolves - with material taken from living canines - again, from both dogs and wolves. This analysis reveals modern dogs to be most closely related to ancient European wolves or dogs - not to any of the wolf groups from outside Europe, nor even to modern European wolves (suggesting the link is with old European wolves that are now extinct). And because the dog remains used in the research are dated to be more than 18,000 years old, it indicates a timing for domestication that is much older than some researchers have previously argued. If correct, it means dogs started to diverge from wolf populations when humans had yet to settle into fixed, agricultural communities and were still hunting and gathering. Image caption The story of how dogs came to be so closely associated with humans is open to debate It is possible there were wolves that would follow these hunters, may be at a distance at first, living off the scraps and discards from the humans' big-game kills such as mammoth, before eventually being incorporated into the human groups as they became less wary. \\"You can see how wolves benefitted from living near humans because they got these carcases, but humans too would have benefitted,\\" said Dr Thalmann. \\"You have to remember that 18,800-32,000 years ago, Europe had much bigger predators than even wolves, such as bears and hyenas. And you can imagine that having wolves living close to you might be a very useful alarm system,\\" he told BBC News. \\"It's a plausible scenario for the origin of the domestication of dogs.\\" The latest study is unlikely to be the last word on the subject, however. Using DNA - and the subtle changes it undergoes over time - to examine animal origins and relationships is a very powerful tool, but far from fool-proof. One of the problems scientists have is that dog populations have become very mixed over time, as a result of being moved around by their human owners. This complicates the genetic signal. The difficulty is further amplified by the fact that some dogs have at times also clearly back-bred with wild wolves. Teasing all this apart is very difficult. A resolution will require more sampling and more analysis, particularly of the core, or nuclear, DNA of ancient animals. This and many of the previous studies have relied on so-called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a small sub-packet of genetic material in cells that, although incredibly useful, does not represent the fullest information possible. The larger nuclear DNA material could provide the more compelling answers but it is far harder to retrieve, especially in very old bones or fossils. A number of research groups around the world are trying, though.

The context describes OKCoin as a Bitcoin company in China offering a Bitcoin exchange and a mobile consumer payment and lending app. Step 2: Identify relevant information. OKCoin Exchange China operates CNY/BTC spot pair with margin trading from its Beijing entity. Step 3: Analyze the information. This information indicates that OKCoin, a Chinese Bitcoin company, operates a CNY/BTC spot pair, which involves exchanging Chinese Yuan (CNY) for Bitcoin (BTC) with margin trading. This exchange takes place from its Beijing entity, located in China. Step 4: Compare the information with the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that China does not allow exchanging Bitcoin. However, the context shows that a Bitcoin company, OKCoin, operates a CNY/BTC spot pair exchange within China. Step 5: Draw a conclusion. Based on the analysis, the evidence in the context contradicts the hypothesis.

Comet A and comet B would enter the inner solar system. But comet C would not enter the inner solar system. Moreover, comet A is categorized as a bright comet, but comet B is categorized as a faint comet. But I can use this background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. What is an answer for this question: Which comet's dust would reflect sunlight, comet A or comet C? A:","completion":"Comet A's dust would reflect sunlight. This is because Comet A enters the inner solar system where it gets close enough to the Sun for its volatile materials to vaporize, forming a tail and coma that become visible, including the dust reflecting sunlight.

In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

China could also face further consequences such as exclusion from more international activities, similar to the disinvitation from the RIMPAC exercise. However, it is also possible that China might attempt to negotiate or engage in more discussions about its actions, particularly in response to increased pressure from the U.S. and other countries.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

An EVTX file is an event log file generated by the Windows operating system. These files store event data collected by the Windows Event Viewer, a tool that allows administrators and users to view and analyze system and application event logs. The EVTX file format was introduced with Windows Vista, replacing the older EVT format used in previous versions of Windows, like Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Event logs can help system administrators and IT professionals identify and troubleshoot various issues with the system, such as hardware and software failures, security issues, or application errors. They also provide valuable information about system events and activities that can be used in monitoring and auditing purposes. To open and view the contents of an EVTX file, you have several options: 1. Use Windows Event Viewer: This is the primary tool for opening and viewing EVTX files on a Windows computer. Here's how you can use the Windows Event Viewer: a. Press the Windows key and type \\"Event Viewer\\" in the search bar, then press Enter. b. In the Event Viewer, click on \\"Action\\" in the top menu and select \\"Open Saved Log.\\" c. Browse to the location of your EVTX file, select it, and click on \\"Open\\" to view the events contained within the file. 2. Use a third-party event log viewer: If you're looking for an alternative to the Windows Event Viewer, there are several third-party tools available that can open and analyze EVTX files. Some popular options include NirSoft's FullEventLogView, SolarWinds Event Log Consolidator, and Log Parser Lizard. 3. Convert the EVTX file to a different format: If you want to view the contents of the EVTX file in a more human-readable format, you can use a tool like Log Parser Studio from Microsoft or the aforementioned Log Parser Lizard to convert the file into CSV, XML, or HTML format. You can then open the converted file using a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or a text editor that supports the chosen format. In summary, EVTX files are event log files used by the Windows operating system, and you can open them using built-in tools like the Windows Event Viewer or third-party event log viewers. Understanding the nature of the EVTX file extension helps you take the necessary steps to view and analyze the event logs stored within these files, which can be invaluable for troubleshooting and monitoring system performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Working as a guidance counselor five years ago in Palm Beach County, Estella Pyfrom noticed that fewer students had access to a computer after school. The sluggish economy forced many families to prioritize their money and use it for more pressing needs. \\"They needed food. They needed to pay their mortgage or their rent,\\" said Pyfrom, a former teacher. \\"Some of them lost their cars. So I knew it was a serious problem.\\" Without a computer at home, or reliable transportation to get to a computer, Pyfrom feared that many of these students would get left behind. So she bought a bus, filled it with computers and brought technology to the kids. Her mobile computer lab, Estella's Brilliant Bus, has provided free, computer-based tutoring for thousands of students since 2011. \\"If people don't have some knowledge of technology, they're going to be limited,\\" said Pyfrom, who retired in 2009 and used money from her savings to buy the bus. \\"It's absolutely essential that they get involved technologically.\\" Pyfrom is determined to help poor children get the same educational opportunities as other children. According to the Institute of the Study of Labor, students who lack access to a home computer are less likely to graduate high school. \\"The digital divide is absolutely real,\\" said Pyfrom, 76. \\"And it didn't just become a reality. It's been there for years, and it's getting bigger and more important.\\" Pyfrom's custom-designed bus is outfitted with 17 computer stations that are connected to high-speed Internet via satellite. Emblazoned on its side are the words \\"Have Knowledge, Will Travel\\" and \\"We bring learning to you.\\" The bus travels to schools, shelters and community centers throughout the county. \\"We serve children starting with age 3 all the way through senior citizens, based on what the needs are,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"We are bringing the learning and the technology to the neighborhoods. They all can benefit from that.\\" Pyfrom and her army of volunteers hold regular classes and tutoring sessions about four days a week. They offer lessons in computer and Internet basics as well as reading, math or science classes that supplement what children are learning in school. Sometimes, the bus simply serves as an open computer lab. The rules on the bus are few and simple. Among them, gum and Facebook are not allowed. Pyfrom takes a no-nonsense approach to her mobile classroom. \\"Excuses don't get the job done,\\" she said. \\"You do whatever it takes to make things happen. That's the only thing that works.\\" The computers are loaded with educational software, providing interactive exercises that reinforce state-mandated curricula. Children receive their own account login and password, allowing them to continue their work from anywhere they can access the Internet. Users can only advance to the next level in a subject once they reach 90% proficiency in the current one, and the software allows Pyfrom to track their progress. For older students, the bus brings GED and college preparatory assistance, anti-bullying and peer mediation classes, and student leadership training. Pyfrom and her team provide about 8,000 hours of instruction to at least 500 children a year. She hopes the extra time will help bring students up to their grade level in reading, vocabulary, math, science and life skills. Freddy and Brianna Rodriguez are two students benefiting from Pyfrom's bus. Adopted from foster care, the siblings struggled with their grades when they entered junior high school. \\"If I didn't have the bus to come to, it'd be hard to get to a computer,\\" said Brianna, 13. \\"My grades have gotten better. The one-on-one time, it helped me.\\" In working with the students, Pyfrom found that many parents didn't know how to use a computer. Now her bus helps them, too. \\"They're learning right along with the kids,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"They don't feel threatened, because what I say to them is, 'If your 4-year-old can use a computer and click a mouse, so can you.' \\" On the bus, adults can receive online banking tutorials, resume assistance and help searching for jobs and affordable housing. Pyfrom's efforts to help low-income families haven't stopped with her bus. She also partnered with a community nonprofit to help provide meals to 3,000 residents each month. Through that work, she's identified other ways her bus can help struggling neighbors build up technological proficiency necessary in the marketplace. \\"We want to do what we can do in (each) neighborhood to make things better for all,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"We run into people who really want to better their lifestyles and are without help. We can help them make a big difference in their neighborhoods.\\" To keep up the momentum of her efforts, Pyfrom has continued to pour her savings into maintaining and modifying her bus, so far spending about 1 million, she says. An easy retirement is not something she aspires to. \\"I'm not tired yet. And I don't think I'm going to get tired,\\" she said. \\"I'm constantly charged up. I look at the faces of the children and I get energized.\\" Pyfrom is determined to see her services expand throughout the state, even the country. She estimates she has enough savings to keep her bus running for another two years, but she hopes to find financial support before she runs out of money. \\"I don't think about what I'm not able to do or not going to be able to do,\\" she said. \\"I plan for the things that I think I'm going to do, need to do and want to do. And I think most of them are going to happen. \\"We've got to keep rolling. We're going to keep taking the service to the neighborhoods, and we are going to keep making a difference.\\" Want to get involved?

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What does the family decide ? to hide his dead body for 2 days The answer is:","completion":"Title: \\"Family Secrets\\" Genre: Dark Comedy, Drama ACT 1: Disquieting Discovery The Benson family, consisting of father David, mother Laura, college-student daughter Sophie, and teenage son Jake, live a seemingly normal and mundane life in a small suburban town in Oregon. All appearances suggest they are a tight-knit, loving family. One day, the family receives a call from a distant relative, Uncle Frank. Frank is a peculiar old man with a taste for adventure and a mysterious past. He announces plans to visit the family, much to their surprise, but they decide to welcome him with open arms. Upon arrival, Frank shares thrilling stories from his past travels, and the family grows fond of him. ACT 2: A Shocking Twist A few days into his visit, Frank is found dead in his room. Autopsy reveals that he died from natural causes due to his frail health and old age. The news spreads, and a formal funeral is planned for two days later. As they prepare for the funeral, they receive an unexpected call from an unknown individual who claims to be an old friend of Frank searching for a missing artifact that the late uncle had possession of. Sensing the potential dangers involving the mysterious artifact, the family decides they must find the object before the unknown caller does. With only two days until Frank's funeral, the family decides to hide his dead body within their house, dealing with the unpleasant results of decomposition. Between all four members of the family, they take turns keeping watch over the body, ensuring its safety from prying eyes and the intruder hunting the artifact. ACT 3: Unraveling the Mystery As the family digs deeper into Uncle Frank's past, they discover that he was once a highly sought after thief during his youth, known for his remarkable ability to steal rare and valuable items for an underground criminal network. The item in question contains a powerful secret: the power to alter one's destiny by changing a single moment in their past. Meanwhile, sketchy figures begin lurking throughout their town, believed to be associates of the mysterious caller. As the family frantically searches through Frank's personal belongings, they uncover a trail that eventually leads them to the artifact. However, they also recognize that the power contained within the artifact is too dangerous to be left in any one person's hands. ACT 4: A Final Showdown During the funeral service, with Frank's body finally laid to rest, the unknown caller makes a sudden appearance, demanding the family hand over the artifact. In a climactic showdown, the Bensons stand up against the antagonist and his cronies, surprising themselves with acts of courage and quick thinking. Ultimately, they succeed in outsmarting the criminals and reclaiming the artifact. ACT 5: Closure and a New Beginning Recognizing the potential danger held by the artifact, the family unanimously agrees to destroy it by jointly tossing it into a nearby river, symbolizing their commitment to face their destinies together without the manipulation of the past. This entire experience bonds the family even closer, and they find a new appreciation for each other and their shared experiences. Back at home, as they return to their ordinary lives, the Bensons reminisce about Uncle Frank's exciting life, finding comfort in having shared a small part of his journey, ultimately adding an adventurous and unforgettable chapter to their family's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Available options: *negative *positive).","completion":"Title: Disappointing Dullness - A Review of \\"Lethargic Labyrinth\\" As a self-proclaimed movie enthusiast, I could not hide my excitement as I walked into the cinema to watch the highly-anticipated film, \\"Lethargic Labyrinth.\\" Unfortunately, my excitement was short-lived as I encountered a two-hour-long production that left me yearning for my precious time back. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this movie to anyone, and here are my reasons why. ​ First and foremost, let's discuss the film's plot (Step 1: Address the plot). Rather than captivating me with a fascinating story, \\"Lethargic Labyrinth\\" managed to deliver the dullest narrative I have had the misfortune of experiencing. The protagonist aimlessly roams through the labyrinth with no clear objective beyond simple survival, which not only became monotonous but also lacked any emotional depth or development (Step 2: Explain the lack of depth and development). The climax, if it could even be called that, fell flat and failed to satisfy the audience's expectations. ​ The acting, unfortunately, was not any better (Step 3: Address the acting). The lead actor's performance came across as uninspired, and the supporting cast did little more than follow suit. The actors seemed like they were simply going through the motions, and not once did I feel any connection to the characters they were portraying. This lack of chemistry significantly hindered my ability to become invested in their struggles or triumphs. ​ Step 4: Discuss the film's visuals and effects. One would think that a movie set in a labyrinthine environment could at least offer some visually striking scenes; in this case, however, the special effects felt outdated and failed to add any excitement to the proceedings. With an uneventful backdrop, low-quality CGI, and an overall lack of innovation, the film's technical aspects proved to be another disappointing factor. ​ Lastly, a functional script might have saved \\"Lethargic Labyrinth,\\" but the film suffered from subpar dialogue throughout (Step 5: Address the dialogue). Characters consistently engaged in irrelevant conversations, adding nothing to the plot or their development. The script seemed more fitting for a substandard soap opera than a high-budget, eagerly anticipated film. ​ In conclusion, though I wished to enjoy the cinematic journey promised by \\"Lethargic Labyrinth,\\" it left me with a sense of disappointment I cannot ignore. With its lackluster plot, uninspired acting, outdated visuals, and cringe-worthy dialogue, this film is hardly one to spend any time or money on. It saddens me to say this, but my only recommendation would be to give this movie a hard pass (Step 6: Summarize and give the overall recommendation)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens?, what is it ?

Possible answers: *None of the above choices .; *The boss ca n't get his cell phone fixed .; *The boss ca n't stop the narrator from fighting .; *The boss ca n't find anyone .;","completion":"The source of management's anger in this situation stems from the fact that the boss cannot find anyone at the office and nobody is answering the phone. This lack of responsiveness and seemingly absent staff is likely causing the boss to wonder what is happening at the workplace, potentially suspecting that the employees are not fulfilling their duties or are engaged in unprofessional behavior. This can lead to a significant disruption in the smooth functioning of the office, as well as result in a loss of productivity and efficiency. The boss's anger is aggravated by the fact that he had to resort to calling a coworker on her cellphone, which might not be the standard means of communication within the office context. This indicates to the boss that the situation at the office is far from what is expected, contributing to his frustration. The options provided may not encapsulate the exact reason for the boss's anger, but the closest one would be \\"The boss can't find anyone.\\" While this is not entirely accurate, as the boss did manage to reach a coworker eventually, it does touch upon the core issue of the boss's frustration, which is their inability to locate the employees or get a response when calling the office. A more accurate option would be: \\"The boss is angry because no one is answering the office phone and the employees are seemingly unaccounted for.\\" This option highlights the main concerns the boss has, which include the lack of communication, the possible absence of employees, and the potential negative implications this could have on the office's productivity and efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He played his entire professional career for Manchester United. The son of rugby union, and Wales international rugby league footballer Danny Wilson, Giggs was born in Cardiff but moved to Manchester at the age of six when his father joined Swinton RLFC. In October 2010, Giggs said he would \\"probably finish [his] career here [Old Trafford],\\" and that he could not see himself \\"dropping down leagues and playing at a lesser level.\\" He said he wanted to go into coaching, describing the management of Manchester United or Wales as \\"the two ultimate jobs,\\" and stating that he was halfway through his UEFA 'A' coaching licence. Ahead of his testimonial in 2011, Gary Neville revealed he would spend the proceeds towards a supporters club and hotel near Old Trafford. Despite objections from Manchester United, Neville's plans were approved in 2012. In 2013, Giggs and Neville launched a hospitality company named GG Hospitality, with plans to build football-themed hotels and cafes around the United Kingdom, initially in Manchester and London. The first operation was a football-themed restaurant named Cafe Football in Stratford, London, which opened in November 2013, with Hotel Football, previously under the guise of the supporters club Neville announced in 2011, scheduled to be opened in late 2014.

To his surprise, the photo, taken backstage after one of his performances, quickly went viral, People reports, nabbing more than 42,000 likes so far and gaining its owner some unexpected new fans. \\"I don't know who you are, but I like you!\\" one woman wrote. Another added, \\"You just tapped into a whole new demographic, my friend.\\" When one mother called him \\"awesome and an amazing husband,\\" Moss replied, \\"You are the real hero for actually pumping. I'm getting too much credit for cleaning a couple bottles and suction thingies.\\" Moss, who SheKnows.com describes as a Christian hip-hop artist from Grand Rapids, Michigan, later followed that post with a photo of his wife, Michelle, breastfeeding their son Judah, which has received almost as many likes. \\"I could go on and on about how happy I am to be a little piece of a movement that I didn't even know existed,\\" he says, though he adds he's \\"also a little saddened to realize how few men (or better put, 'males') don’t do the simplest task like washing a bottle.\\" While \\"I appreciate the love, likes, and kind words,\\" he says, breastfeeding mothers \\"are making HUGE sacrifices to give our next generation the best possible start in life\\" and \\"if anyone should get the credit it should be people like my wife!\\" In a comment on that photo, he later added that he doesn't discount \\"the millions of women who either can’t or choose not to breastfeed,\\" and that the important thing is to feed babies with love. (A photo of a mom's \\"perfect\\" post-baby body is also getting hype.) Expand this summary.","completion":"A day in the life of a rapper may not be what you imagine, especially in the case of George Moss, a Christian hip-hop artist from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Moss recently uploaded a photo of himself backstage after a performance cleaning breast pump equipment for his wife, which promptly went viral on Facebook. The photo, capturing a glimpse into the rapper's personal life, has garnered over 42,000 likes and attracted many new fans who praised him for being supportive and involved in parenting. Moss shared another photo soon afterward, featuring his wife Michelle breastfeeding their son Judah. Expressing gratitude for the positive response, he was also surprised by how many men were not involved in simple tasks such as cleaning baby bottles. Moss emphasized his appreciation for breastfeeding mothers who make significant sacrifices to provide the best possible start for their children. He also acknowledged the importance of feeding babies with love, regardless of whether mothers are able or choose to breastfeed. Moss's unexpected fame from sharing these intimate moments reveals a growing awareness and support for involved parenting, particularly when it comes to enabling breastfeeding. His photos highlight the crucial role that fathers can play in creating an environment that supports and encourages healthy choices for infant care. It is essential to recognize that providing support to breastfeeding mothers is not solely about helping with the physical aspects, such as cleaning bottles or pumps. Emotional support can also make a world of difference. For some mothers, breastfeeding can be a challenging and emotional experience filled with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. A partner's encouragement and reassurance can provide the confidence and motivation needed to persevere. While Moss rightfully acknowledges that breastfeeding may not be the right choice for all families, his actions and public display of support have undoubtedly resonated with many new parents. As more men embrace their roles as actively involved, supportive partners in infant care, Moss's actions serve as an inspiration for other fathers to become integral components in their children's lives from the very beginning. The positive reaction to these viral moments also showcases society's increasing awareness of the significance of breastfeeding, as well as the critical role both parents play in supporting and raising their children. As more fathers step up and participate in all aspects of parenting tasks, from bedtime routines to emotional support, the benefits for both the family unit and society as a whole will only increase. In conclusion, George Moss's viral photos have opened up a broader conversation on involved parenting, the importance of breastfeeding when possible, and the role fathers can play in supporting their partners. With this new understanding and communication about the responsibilities of both parents, we can hope to create an even more supportive and nurturing environment for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Andhra Pradesh, from which Telangana would be carved, saw protests for and against the new state this year. The final decision to create a new state lies with the Indian parliament. But the state assembly must pass a resolution approving the creation of Telangana. In February, the government decided to set up a committee headed by an ex-chief justice of the Supreme Court of India, BN Srikrishna, to examine the demands for the new state. Mr Srikrishna handed over his report to federal Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday. Mr Chidambaram said he would hold consultations with eight recognised political parties of Andhra Pradesh on 6 January after which the \\"report will be made public\\". \\"That is the only way in a democracy and those who respect democracy must also respect the process of democracy,\\" Mr Chidambaram said. Fearing fresh violence in the state after the publication of the report, the government has appealed to the people of Andhra Pradesh to stay calm.

In December last year, India's Congress party-led government promised that the new state would be formed but later said more talks were needed. Parties are split on the issue. Congress is also in power in Andhra Pradesh. The announcement prompted widespread protests in the state, and a student committed suicide in support of the formation of Telangana.

Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told.

When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car.

On 21 February 1915, Endurance, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \\"dogloos\\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200 miles (320 km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.In February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles (153 km) since 19 January. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \\"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \\"she would be crushed like an eggshell\\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards.

Summarize this article: Saudi Arabia has financed a large purchase of infantry weapons from Croatia and quietly funneled them to antigovernment fighters in Syria in a drive to break the bloody stalemate that has allowed President Bashar al-Assad to cling to power, according to American and Western officials familiar with the purchases. The weapons began reaching rebels in December via shipments shuttled through Jordan, officials said, and have been a factor in the rebels’ small tactical gains this winter against the army and militias loyal to Mr. Assad. The arms transfers appeared to signal a shift among several governments to a more activist approach to assisting Syria’s armed opposition, in part as an effort to counter shipments of weapons from Iran to Mr. Assad’s forces. The weapons’ distribution has been principally to armed groups viewed as nationalist and secular, and appears to have been intended to bypass the jihadist groups whose roles in the war have alarmed Western and regional powers. For months regional and Western capitals have held back on arming the rebels, in part out of fear that the weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists. But officials said the decision to send in more weapons is aimed at another fear in the West about the role of jihadist groups in the opposition. Such groups have been seen as better equipped than many nationalist fighters and potentially more influential. The action also signals the recognition among the rebels’ Arab and Western backers that the opposition’s success in pushing Mr. Assad’s military from much of Syria’s northern countryside by the middle of last year gave way to a slow, grinding campaign in which the opposition remains outgunned and the human costs continue to climb. Washington’s role in the shipments, if any, is not clear. Officials in Europe and the United States, including those at the Central Intelligence Agency, cited the sensitivity of the shipments and declined to comment publicly. But one senior American official described the shipments as “a maturing of the opposition’s logistical pipeline.” The official noted that the opposition remains fragmented and operationally incoherent, and added that the recent Saudi purchase was “not in and of itself a tipping point.” “I remain convinced we are not near that tipping point,” the official said. The official added that Iran, with its shipments to Syria’s government, still outstrips what Arab states have sent to the rebels. The Iranian arms transfers have fueled worries among Sunni Arab states about losing a step to Tehran in what has become a regional contest for primacy in Syria between Sunni Arabs and the Iran-backed Assad government and Hezbollah of Lebanon. Another American official said Iran has been making flights with weapons into Syria that are so routine that he referred to them as “a milk run.” Several of the flights were by an Iranian Air Force Boeing jet using the name Maharaj Airlines, he said. While Persian Gulf Arab nations have been sending military equipment and other assistance to the rebels for more than a year, the difference in the recent shipments has been partly of scale. Officials said multiple planeloads of weapons have left Croatia since December, when many Yugoslav weapons, previously unseen in the Syrian civil war, began to appear in videos posted by rebels on YouTube. Many of the weapons — which include a particular type of Yugoslav-made recoilless gun, as well as assault rifles, grenade launchers, machine guns, mortars and shoulder-fired rockets for use against tanks and other armored vehicles — have been extensively documented by one blogger, Eliot Higgins, who writes under the name Brown Moses and has mapped the new weapons’ spread through the conflict. He first noticed the Yugoslav weapons in early January in clashes in the Dara’a region near Jordan, but by February he was seeing them in videos posted by rebels fighting in the Hama, Idlib and Aleppo regions. Officials familiar with the transfers said the arms were part of an undeclared surplus in Croatia remaining from the 1990s Balkan wars. One Western official said the shipments included “thousands of rifles and hundreds of machine guns” and an unknown quantity of ammunition. Croatia’s Foreign Ministry and arms-export agency denied that such shipments had occurred. Saudi officials have declined requests for interviews about the shipments for two weeks. Jordanian officials also declined to comment. ||||| The UK said it was ready to 'significantly increase' its support for Syria's opposition The Syrian opposition has agreed to attend an international summit in Rome, after the US and UK \\"promised specific aid\\" to the Syrian people. The group had previously announced it would boycott the talks because of \\"the world's silence\\" over the violence. US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Minister William Hague earlier confirmed there would be more support for Syria's opposition. Mr Kerry was in London as part of his first foreign trip since taking office. The Syrian opposition's announcement came amid reports of a deadly explosion and heavy fighting in an eastern part of the Syrian capital, Damascus. It also emerged on Monday that a member of the UN peacekeeping force monitoring the ceasefire between Israeli and Syrian troops in the demilitarised Golan Heights was missing. \\"We can confirm that a staff member is not accounted for and we are in touch with the relevant parties to determine what has happened,\\" UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey told the Associated Press. 'Alleviate the suffering' After meeting Mr Hague and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Kerry called Syrian Opposition Council President Moaz Al-Khatib and encouraged him to join the Rome talks on Thursday. No further details have been released about the conversation. But on Monday evening, Mr al-Khatib said in a Facebook post that his group would fly to Italy. \\"After discussions with coalition leaders and various calls, the coalition leadership has decided to stop the suspension of the visit to the Friends of Syria conference in Rome,\\" the statement said. More specifically Mr Kerry and Mr Hague had both offered guarantees \\"to alleviate the suffering of our people\\". The talks would be \\"used as a practical way to reassess relations between the Syrian opposition and international parties\\", the post said. Mr Kerry is due to meet Syrian opposition members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin on Tuesday. The US Secretary of State, who succeeded Hillary Clinton, is on an 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East. Speaking in London, Mr Kerry said he understood Syrians wanted results from the summit and promised it would not just be a talking shop. \\"We are determined that the Syrian opposition is not going to be dangling in the wind, wondering where the support is, if it is coming,'' he told reporters after meeting Mr Cameron and Mr Hague. \\"We are not going to let the Syrian opposition not have its ability to have its voice properly heard in this process.\\" Mr Hague also said the UK was preparing to \\"significantly increase\\" its support for Syria's opposition. Earlier, the Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem had announced his government was ready for talks with its opponents, even armed rebels. Meanwhile, a massive blast was reported in the al-Qaboun neighbourhood in Damascus on Monday evening. Several Syrian security were killed in the explosion caused by a car bomb, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group. Rebels were clashing with security forces and mortars had been fired in the area, it added. The SOHR is one of the most prominent organisations documenting and reporting incidents and casualties in the Syrian conflict. The group says its reports are impartial, though its information cannot be independently verified. ||||| At least 141 people, half of them children, were killed when the Syrian military fired at least four missiles into the northern province of Aleppo last week, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. A Syrian villager, Abu Ibrahim, 73, writes the name of his granddaughter on her grave who was killed from an airstrike by Syrian government forces, at Jabal al-Zaweya village of Sarja, in Idlib, Syria,... (Associated Press) The international rights group said the strikes hit residential areas and called them an \\"escalation of unlawful attacks against Syria's civilian population.\\" The statement from the New York-based group followed a visit to the area by a HRW researcher. Aleppo, Syria's largest city, has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the civil war pitting President Bashar Assad's regime against rebels fighting to oust him. Rebels quickly seized several neighborhoods in an offensive on the city in July, but the government still controls some districts and the battle has developed into a bloody stalemate, with heavy street fighting that has ruined neighborhoods and forced thousands to flee. A Human Rights Watch researcher who visited Aleppo last week to inspect the targeted sites, said up to 20 buildings were destroyed in each area hit by a missile. There were no signs of any military targets in the residential districts, located in rebel-held parts of Aleppo and its northern countryside, said Ole Solvang, the HRW's researcher. \\"Just when you think things can't get any worse, the Syrian government finds ways to escalate its killing tactics,\\" Solvang said. Human rights watch said 71 children were among the 141 people killed in the four missile strikes on three opposition-controlled neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo. It listed the names of the targeted neighborhoods as Jabal Badro, Tariq al-Bab and Ard al-Hamra. The fourth strike documented by the group was in Tel Rifat, north of Aleppo. \\"The extent of the damage from a single strike, the lack of (military) aircraft in the area at the time, and reports of ballistic missiles being launched from a military base near Damascus overwhelmingly suggest that government forces struck these areas with ballistic missiles,\\" the report said. Syrian anti-regime activists first reported the attacks last week, saying they involved ground-to-ground missiles, and killed dozens of people. The reports could not be independently confirmed because Syrian authorities severely restrict access to media. Human Rights Watch said it compiled a list of those killed in the missile strikes from cemetery burial records, interviews with relatives and neighbors, and information from the Aleppo Media Center and the Violations Documentation Center, a network of local activists. The rebels control large swaths of land in northeastern Syria. In recent weeks, Assad's regime has lost control of several sites with key infrastructure in that part of the country, including a hydroelectric dam, a major oil field and two army bases along the road linking Aleppo with the airport to its east. A key focus for the rebels in the Aleppo area is to capture the city's international airport, which the opposition fighters have been attacking for weeks. Opposition forces have also been hitting the heart of Damascus with occasional mortars shells or bombings, posing a stiff challenge to the regime in its seat of power. U.S. and NATO officials have previously said that Syria has a significant ballistic missile capability and is believed to have a few hundred missiles with a range of some 700 kilometers (440 miles) that could hit targets deep inside Turkey, a NATO member and one of the harshest critics of the Assad regime. NATO has in recent weeks deployed Patriot missile systems along Turkey's border with Syria. The missile attacks have outraged the leaders of the exiled opposition who have accused their Western backers of indifference to the suffering of the Syrian people. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Saudi Arabia has bought a lot of weapons from Croatia and has sent them to fighters in Syria who are against the government. They have done this to try and stop President Bashar al-Assad from keeping his power. The weapons have been helping the rebels fight against the army and other groups that support President Assad. These weapons have been given to certain groups that are not as scary as some jihadist groups. This is because some people are worried that if they give weapons to the rebels, they might end up with terrorists. The weapons from Saudi Arabia have helped the rebels but they have not yet tipped the balance in their favor. Iran has been giving weapons to Syria's government and this has caused tension between Sunni Arab states and Iran. The United States and United Kingdom say they will provide more support to Syria's opposition, and the Syrian opposition has agreed to attend an international summit to discuss the conflict. Meanwhile, there is still a lot of fighting and destruction happening in Syria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"Building a refinery at Greendale is likely to cause an increase in the acidity of the water in the surrounding area, due to the emissions generated as a result of burning fossil fuels. This increase in acidity could potentially have devastating consequences for the local marine ecosystem, as was observed in the case of Coast Brigs. The process of ocean acidification, as described, begins with the release of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, is a major contributor to this increase in atmospheric CO2. When the CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, causing the pH levels of the water to decrease and making the water more acidic. This increase in acidity can be detrimental to many marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate shells or exoskeletons, such as corals and shellfish. Acidic conditions cause the dissolution of calcium carbonate, weakening the structures and increasing the organisms' vulnerability to disease or predation. Furthermore, an increase in acidity can disrupt the reproduction and growth of various marine species and, consequently, impact the entire food chain. In the case of Coast Brigs, the construction of the coal-burning refinery significantly contributed to the local increase in ocean acidity and, ultimately, led to the death of coral and marine life in the area. The construction of a similar refinery at Greendale could have analogous consequences, even if it may take time for the effects to become noticeable. However, it's important to note that there are various factors which can influence the extent to which ocean acidification occurs and affects marine life in a particular region. Factors such as ocean currents, the buffering capacity of the local seawater, and other sources of pollution in the area may all play a role in determining how severe the consequences of ocean acidification will be. Nevertheless, building a refinery at Greendale would most likely lead to an increase in the acidity of the water in the area, posing a major threat to the well-being of the same marine species that survived in this location. Taking into account the negative effects of constructing a refinery on marine ecosystems, it is essential to consider the potential consequences and alternative, more environmentally friendly options before proceeding with such a project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Background music may seem harmless, but it can have a powerful effect on those who hear it. Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales. So restaurant owners might be well advised to play faster music to keep the customers moving-unless, of course, the resulting indigestion leads to complaints.

Input: this happened a while ago, but ramifications are still relevant, and I've been told different judgements by different people on if I'm an asshole or not... so a while ago my best friend and I decided we wanted to get together and have an epic road trip. we live quite a ways away from each other; 2800km (1700 miles). so the plan was for her to fly out to where I lived and then we'd road trip back to where she lived. once there we were going to spend about a week together just having fun and reminiscing (we were college friends and hadn't seen each other in a couple years). along the way stopping in different places and generally having a great time. the first part of this plan went off without a hitch. she flew to my place, we had an awesome time, and then the road trip began. we had a blast-- blaring music, sleeping in the car under the stars, swimming under waterfalls, and exploring interesting off road attractions. I noticed, however, that she was getting anxious because she wasn't getting money in from her work that she was supposed to (something about papers that were supposed to be forwarded in time). I told her not to worry about it-- I had enough money, and that she could pay me back anything when we got back to her place and sorted it out. a major part of our trip that I had wanted to do was visit a big city near where we were going to be. she knew this (we'd made a rough plan of everything we were going to do on this trip), and knew that we were going to take a bus into the city from a smaller town so as we weren't driving in an unfamiliar city with millions of people in it. well the day we were going to the city her grumpiness and agitation had begun to get to head. she didn't speak the entire bus ride there, so I let her be, thinking maybe when we got there she'd be in a better mood (after all, we had lots of fun stuff planned for the city!). once in the city, however, she immediately declared how much she hated it, and how everyone there was always so stupid and angry and how the city smelled funny and went on and on. I snapped and asked her why she didn't say something *before* we'd gotten there. no response. regardless, we went to our first destination. she noticed how much this place cost to go to, and said she didn't have enough money. I said that was fine, that I'd pay for it. she said no-- told me to go by myself. I was angry at this point, and said that was ridiculous and began to walk away. she said she was just going to stand there and wait for me to go to which I retorted 'fine', and just continued walking. I ended up walking only about thirty feet to a nice fountain where I was able to sit and relax and calm down a bit. I looked over and saw her a few minutes later walk away; she obviously didn't see me. I bit later she text me asking me where the hell I was. I told her where I was, and she was *furious*, saying she'd already walked all the way back to the bus station. (I will add here that we are, despite the immaturity this may all seem-- fully grown adults). I went back to the bus station, and she wouldn't say two words to me. when we got back to where the car was she said she was calling her boyfriend to pick her up (we were about 400km from her house only), and that I should just leave and go home (a nice 2500km drive... by myself with no warning). not that I objected as I was *very* angry at that moment-- I'd spent a lot of money on that trip, and I didn't understand why she was so furious at me. and since that day she hasn't talked to me since-- nor has any of our mutual friends as, apparently, I am an asshole. ...am I?

Three months later, David Abbott (Ruffalo), a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a 'fateful' happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth's spirit begin to 'bond', as much as that is possible, and he takes her out-of-town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it true that can a pawn take a piece in front of it based on the following text? Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction as it moves. A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right (see diagram).","completion":"Based on the provided text, it is not true that a pawn can take a piece in front of it directly. The text clearly states that a pawn captures differently than how it moves, meaning its capturing move is distinct from its regular forward move. In chess, a pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally forward instead, either one square to the left or one square to the right. This is a unique characteristic of the pawn, as other chess pieces such as the rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king capture in the same direction they move. To further understand the pawn's movements and the circumstances in which it captures, let's delve into some game scenarios: 1. In a regular situation, if there is an opponent's piece directly in front of a pawn, the pawn cannot capture that piece nor can it advance forward. In this case, the pawn would be \\"blocked\\" as it has no available forward moves or captures. 2. If an opponent's piece is diagonally forward to the left or right of the pawn, the pawn can capture that piece by moving to the respective square. 3. It is essential to remember that a pawn can only advance forward when there are no pieces blocking its way. If there is an open space, a pawn has the option to move one square forward or, if it is still in its starting position (on the second rank for white pawns or the seventh rank for black pawns), it can move two squares forward as its first move. 4. Another unique aspect of pawn capturing is \\"en passant.\\" This rule applies when a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. In this case, the opponent's pawn has the option to capture the first pawn \\"en passant\\" as if it had only moved one square forward. This capture must be done immediately in the next move, or the right to do so is forfeited. In conclusion, based on the text and an understanding of the rules and movements of a pawn in a chess game, a pawn cannot capture a piece directly in front of it. Instead, a pawn's capturing move is limited to its diagonal forward movements to the left or right. The uniqueness of a pawn's capturing move differentiates it from other chess pieces and emphasizes the importance of considering the specificities of each piece's movements and capturing abilities when strategizing during a game of chess."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To do this, we'll subtract 27586*j from both sides: 31976*j - 27586*j = 27586*j - 27586*j - 65850 Now, after doing the subtraction on both sides, we get: 4390*j = -65850 Next, we want to find the value of j.

Team Black studied air pollution and the ozone layer, Team Red studied the water. But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which team didn't observe that aerosol sprays are being released into the atmosphere? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the research focuses of each team, it can be concluded that Team Red did not observe aerosol sprays being released into the atmosphere. Team Black was primarily studying air pollution and the ozone layer. Their focus on air pollution would involve monitoring and analyzing various sources of pollution, including aerosol sprays that release harmful chlorine and bromine gases. Thus, Team Black would have been the team to observe aerosol sprays being released into the atmosphere. On the other hand, Team Red was studying the water in Antarctica. Their research focus would include the effects of pollution on water bodies, such as how increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion impacts marine life and ecosystems. Although aerosol sprays indirectly affect water through the disruption of the nitrogen cycle and the destruction of plankton, Team Red's primary focus was on the direct impact on water environments and not on the aerosol sprays themselves.

Question: It's common for parents to feel emotional when the moment comes for their child to leave home and go to university. Even parents who don't speak about the event are likely to feel a sense of sadness because it's the end of an era where you and your family were at the centre of your child's world. As a parent you'll probably continue to support your child in different ways, but the main job of raising your child is over. It's a huge change for everyone involved. There are a few things that you can do to make the transition easier. Plan carefully for your child's departure and think about how you can help. Many parents take their child to university for the first time. If you decide to do that, be ready to feel a real wrench when the time comes to say goodbye. Your child will probably be as nervous as you are about the moment when you finally say goodbye - but that might not show! Be positive and cheerful about the choice your child has made to continue studying, and plan to leave once you've unpacked the car and looked around your child's new living accommodations. If you can, save your tears for the car - you'll make things easier on your child and yourself. The more you've invested in being a parent, the more you'll feel a sense of loss, so the sadness you feel now is a sign that you've been a good mom or dad. Remind yourself that parenting is all about raising an independent and confident child who functions well without you. If your child quickly settles and starts enjoying himself, you should congratulate yourself. It's also only fair to allow yourself some time to grieve . Don't expect to pick yourself up and move on straight away. But you may decide to find a hobby or sport to fill your extra time. Perhaps you've always wanted to learn a new language, go to yoga classes or take up swimming. You may decide to spend more time with family and close friends, who are likely to be feeling the absence of your child as well. Agree on the best approach to staying in touch...

The text in French, \\"Pêcher le gaspareau dans les eaux intérieures du comté d'Inverness avec une trappe en filet d'une longueur supérieure à 15 m 200 84\\", can be translated to English as: \\"Fishing for alewife (gaspareau) in the inland waters of Inverness County using a net trap with a length greater than 15 meters 200 84\\" In this French text, there is a discussion about fishing for a specific type of fish, known as \\"gaspareau\\" in French, which is also known as the \\"alewife\\" in English. The alewife is a small, herring-like fish (Alosa pseudoharengus) that is commonly found in the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as coastal and inland waters in northeastern North America. The text specifies that the intended fishing area is located in the inland waters of Inverness County. Inverness County is a region found in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia that has a coastline along the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean, as well as numerous rivers and lakes. These inland waters provide a suitable habitat for alewives. The French text also describes the use of a net trap called a \\"trappe en filet\\" in this fishing activity, with specific reference to its dimensions. This net trap is stated to have a length greater than 15 meters. The numbers \\"200 84\\" are also mentioned, but it is unclear whether they are related to the length or another feature of the net trap as context is missing.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the mentioned process is \\"A person talks.\\" To understand this process, we can break it down into the following four steps: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs: This occurs during inhalation when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and lowering the air pressure inside the lungs. The lowered pressure causes outside air to rush in, filling the lungs with a fresh supply of oxygen. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: Once inside the lungs, the oxygen-rich air travels through a network of small air sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin and surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The oxygen in the air diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product, diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be exhaled. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal chords: When we speak, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, making the chest cavity smaller and increasing the air pressure inside the lungs. This forces air out of the lungs and up through the windpipe (trachea). As the air passes through the voice box (larynx), it causes the vocal cords to vibrate, producing sound. 4. A person talks: This is the final step of the process, where the sound produced by the vibrating vocal cords is shaped into speech by the tongue, lips, and other parts of the mouth. The human brain controls the fine movements of these muscles to form words and sentences, allowing us to communicate with others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","completion":"In cases where there are significant uncertainties or residual risk, the EIA describes the emergency planning requirements. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process that evaluates the potential effects a proposed project may have on the environment. It is an important tool in decision-making, as it identifies and addresses potential environmental impacts before a project proceeds. One aspect of the EIA process is considering and accounting for emergency situations where significant uncertainties or residual risks may exist. Emergency planning requirements are provisions and guidelines developed to establish a response strategy to potential emergencies during a project's implementation. These requirements focus on reducing risks, preventing accidents, and minimizing any adverse impacts on human health and the environment. In the context of an EIA, emergency planning requirements may include, but are not limited to: 1. Identification of potential emergency scenarios: This involves a thorough assessment of potential risks and uncertainties that may arise during the project's implementation. This can include natural disasters, technical failures, human error, or any other unforeseen occurrences. 2. Response strategies and procedures: Establishing clear and concise guidelines and procedures for responding to a specific emergency is crucial. These strategies may include evacuation plans, hazardous material containment, first aid provisions, communication channels with relevant authorities, and other necessary tools and resources to manage the situation effectively. 3. Roles and responsibilities: Designating roles and responsibilities for individuals and organizations is essential to ensure timely and efficient responses to emergencies. This may involve assigning tasks such as incident reporting, emergency response coordination, on-site management, medical assistance, and external communication to respective teams or personnel. 4. Training and capacity-building: Regular training and capacity-building exercises should be provided to personnel at all levels of the project. This enables efficient handling of emergencies, familiarity with response strategies and respective roles, and improved overall project safety. 5. Continual improvement and review: Emergency planning should not be treated as a one-time event, but rather as an ongoing process. Regular reviews and updates to the plan should be conducted in light of new information, project changes or regulatory requirements, to continually improve the project's preparedness for emergencies. Understanding and complying with emergency planning requirements within the EIA process is crucial for minimizing the risk of adverse impacts on human health and the environment. It ensures that adequate measures are put in place to handle emergencies in a timely and efficient manner, ultimately safeguarding both people and the environment during the course of a project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Opt for a color that blends with your siding to make the house seem larger. Plan around architectural features, like dormers and sloped roofs.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Making Your House Look Beautiful with Unique Roof Shingles Hello, little friends! Today, we'll learn about how to make your house look even more amazing using different types of roof shingles. Shingles are like the clothes your house wears on top. Just like you choose stylish clothes to look great, we can choose different designs or shapes for our roof shingles to make our house stand out. 1. Shingle Design and Shape: Let's start by talking about the design or shape of the roof shingles. Some houses have lots of small shingles that look like fish scales. Others have bigger ones that look like puzzle pieces. By picking a cool design or shape, we can make our house really stand out and say, \\"Hey, look at me! I'm special!\\" 2. Materials: Just like our clothes can be made of different fabrics, like cotton or wool, roof shingles can also be made of different materials. Some of the most beautiful shingles are made from clay, slate, or wood. Each of these materials makes your house look different and unique. Clay shingles can make your house look old-fashioned and charming, like a cozy little cottage. Slate is a heavy type of stone that has been used for a long time, making your house look strong and grand. Wooden shingles are natural and make your house look all warm and friendly, like a big hug! 3. Colors: Choosing the right color for your roof shingles is important too. If we want our house to look bigger and more spacious, we can pick a color that is similar to the color of the walls (the siding) of our house. For example, if your house is painted light blue, you might choose shingles that are also light blue or gray. This makes everything look connected and creates a bigger-looking house. 4. Plan Around Your House Features: Every house is different and has its own special features, just like each one of us has something special and unique about us. Some houses have things called dormers (like little windows that stick out from the roof) or sloped roofs that go up and down. When choosing our roof shingles, we should think about these special features and make sure our shingles will look great with them. Maybe we want to use a special pattern around the dormers or choose shingles that flow nicely along the sloped roofs. This way, our house will look like everything works well together, and it will be even more beautiful! So, little friends, now you know how we can make a statement with our roof shingles. Remember, just like choosing cool clothes to wear, we can choose unique designs, materials, colors, and plans to make our house look amazing!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","completion":"John would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. Since he applies the optimal decision-making process, he would try to make decisions based on rational evaluation and calculations, which involve assigning utility values to each of the options. On the other hand, Keith relies more on his hunches and intuition, which means he may not necessarily assign a utility value to each decision.

In what year was the Rokeby Venus badly destroyed? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","completion":"The Rokeby Venus was badly destroyed in 1914, as mentioned in the context provided.

League One underdogs Peterhead and Alloa Athletic have defied expectations by progressing through to the last 16 of the Scottish League Cup as group winners. This achievement not only brings joy to their loyal fanbases, but also adds a layer of excitement to the competition, demonstrating that even the lower-ranked teams can challenge the giants of Scottish football. Peterhead's Rise to the Top: Peterhead, a fishing town in the North East of Scotland, might not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing Scottish football prowess. However, the team's journey to the last 16 of the Scottish League Cup proves that they should not be taken lightly. Led by manager Jim McInally, the club fought hard to overcome the odds, demonstrating resilience, determination, and formidable teamwork. The Blue Toon's journey began with a strong start, winning their opening match against Cove Rangers and then carrying on that momentum to secure crucial victories against Raith Rovers and Falkirk. The consistency of their performances led to Peterhead topping their group with a total of nine points, surprising fans and analysts alike. Key players like forward Rory McAllister and midfielder Scott Brown have been instrumental in the team's success, showcasing incredible skill, creativity, and determination. Peterhead's strong defensive strategy has also been a factor, with goalkeeper Joshua Rae proving to be crucial in tight situations. Alloa Athletic's Breakthrough Performance: Alloa Athletic, known as The Wasps, have had an impressive display in the Scottish League Cup, progressing to the last 16 as group winners. Managed by Peter Grant, the club has exceeded expectations, showcasing immense skill and unity as their players came together to make it through the group stages. Alloa embarked on their journey in the competition with full force, notching up impressive wins against Livingston, Inverness CT, and Raith Rovers. They managed to accumulate ten points in the process, a remarkable achievement for a team of their stature.

The club's collective spirit has been evident throughout their campaign, earning them recognition and respect from the football fraternity. Prospects for the Last 16 and Beyond: As Peterhead and Alloa Athletic progress to the last 16 of the Scottish League Cup, they face more significant challenges ahead. Both clubs will have to marshal every ounce of talent, skill, and determination within their ranks to stand a chance against the more established teams in the competition. However, the underdog spirit that has brought them this far should not be underestimated. The mere fact that they have managed to qualify as group winners lends itself to the possibility of more surprises ahead. Fans of Scottish football will be eagerly anticipating the next chapter of their ongoing journey. Conclusion: The progress of Peterhead and Alloa Athletic in this year's Scottish League Cup is not just a reflection of their hard work and determination, but also an illustration of the fact that football is as much about heart, passion, and unity as it is about skill and resources. As these underdogs continue their journey, the footballing world watches in anticipation, knowing that one thing is for sure – they will not go down without a fight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The city officials have denied any reports of supernatural occurrences and have stated that the park is closed due to ongoing renovation and preservation projects. Our protagonist, John Hart, is an eager, aspiring investigative journalist seeking an opportunity to make his name in the field of journalism. He comes across a strange file on his late father's computer, which sparks his interest in the Forbidden Terrain. His father, a former respected journalist, had archived a collection of documents hinting at a clandestine project underway in the forest park. Intrigued, John sets out to unravel the mystery behind the Forbidden Terrain, but to do so, he needs permission to enter the restricted area. John manages to track down the aloof James Treadwell, the Commissioner of Public Lands, who has the authority to grant a special permit to access the park. He pleads his case before the Commissioner, sharing his father's findings and expressing his belief that something unusual is happening in the forest. The Commissioner, taken aback by John's persistence and the strength of the evidence, decides to grant him a temporary permit. With the permit secured, John begins his investigation. As he delves deeper into the forest, he encounters several challenges, including trespassing local gangs, treacherous terrain, and the appearance of inexplicable supernatural phenomena. However, in the heart of the forest, he discovers an abandoned, underground facility that appears to be the hub of all the strange happenings. The facility, run by a covert government organization called \\"The Enclave,\\" is conducting experiments on human subjects using advanced, unregulated technology in a bid to develop psychic abilities for military use. John captures video footage of the facility and its ongoing experiments, planning to expose the horrific truth to the world. However, his actions attract the attention of The Enclave's ruthless security forces, led by enigmatic Commander Stern. With his life in danger and the evidence in his possession, John is forced to make a daring escape from the forest park, narrowly evading capture. In a thrilling finale, John returns to the city with the evidence he has collected, making his way to the Commissioner's office and revealing the truth behind The Forbidden Terrain. Together, they inform the public about the secret government program operating in the park, sparking a massive scandal that leads to the dissolution of The Enclave and the arrest of its key operatives. Ultimately, John's determination and courage result in the reopening of the Forbidden Terrain, and he establishes himself as a prominent investigative journalist. He dedicates his exposé to his late father, who had unknowingly set the stage for unraveling the shadowy truth under the guise of a simple question - \\"Where did he get the permit from?\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Every day from the time we wake up until the time we go to bed, we are bombarded with information from all sides, from TV, radio, newspapers and books; from family, friends, and colleagues. As a new cable television subscriber, I am ly amazed at the quantity and varying levels of information quality on cable television. Including the networks, there are eight TV \\"news\\" organizations vying to provide us with all the information we can possibly absorb. Newspaper, magazines, books, radio, the Internet, email, snail mail, and the telephone all compete for our attention and our minds. At the office conversations around the water cooler and coffee maker serve to spread even more items of information. There is valuable information out there about the world we live in, on topics as varied as health, safety, traffic, nutrition, business, finance, philosophy, nature, science, weather, history and the human condition. There is also a large amount of misleading and outright false information, not just on controversial subjects such as politics and religion but on any topic one can think of, including all of the topics mentioned above. With all this information coming at us from all directions, how does one sift through it all to sort out the facts from the fiction, the truth from the lies, the more important from the less important? Should we turn off the TV, cancel our newspaper subscriptions, disconnect our phones and modems to become information \\"hermits\\"? Probably not. A better method of sifting through the information wave without being overwhelmed and confused is to become a skeptical inquirer-or skeptic-with regard to the surrounding world.

In the beginning, Benjamin was quite skeptical about the effectiveness of hypnosis, especially since he had tried different methods in the past, like nicotine patches and gum. However, the hypnosis sessions were focused on modifying his thought process and cravings at a subconscious level, which began to alter his perception of cigarettes. Dennis, on the other hand, was increasingly motivated to stay away from cigarettes, witnessing Benjamin's progress through these hypnosis treatments. He could already sense an improvement in their apartment's atmosphere, as well as his own health. Dennis found himself breathing easier, feeling less congested, and having more energy to accomplish his daily tasks. Most importantly, Dennis was appreciative that his partner was taking this crucial step for not only his own well-being but also for the benefit of others around him. Benjamin's hypnosis treatments consisted of weekly sessions with a certified hypnotist, who carefully guided him into deep relaxation while directly addressing his smoking habits. Each session focused on breaking the association between stress and the need for cigarettes, reinforcing healthier alternatives for managing daily stressors. The hypnotist also emphasized positive self-affirmations, strengthening Benjamin's resolve to maintain a smoke-free lifestyle. Over time, Benjamin noticed that his cravings significantly diminished, and he no longer had the urge to reach for a cigarette whenever he felt stressed. The thought of smoking became increasingly unappealing, allowing him to let go of the habit with more ease. Dennis was thrilled at Benjamin's transformation, and they both found other enjoyable activities to bond over, like cooking healthier meals and exercising together.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Answer the above question based on the context below: In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour. The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner. To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon. Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005. Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales. Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that \\"The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour,\\" but also adding \\"I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic.\\"The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively. Destinations included Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America. Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards. Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0. At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000.In 2002, the tour documentary And All That Could Have Been was released featuring a collection of performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour.

Samuel has a few dogs running around their house while Adam has no pets.","completion":"Although Samuel and Adam share many common interests, their preferences for pets differ significantly. Samuel has a deep passion for animals, which is evident in the way he has designed his home as a haven for his beloved pets. With a few dogs running around his house, Samuel has found a great source of companionship and joy in the presence of his furry friends. The spacious arrangement of Samuel's home, the carefully chosen flooring, and the specially designed play areas are all testaments to Samuel's devotion to ensuring the well-being of his pets. Samuel also takes great pride in creating a harmonious environment that not only nurtures his dogs' physical needs but also caters to their emotional and mental well-being. These pets have become an essential part of his daily life, and Samuel thrives on the unconditional love and trust they provide. In contrast, Adam loves animals but does not own any pets. There could be a variety of reasons behind this. First, he may not have the necessary time and resources to dedicate to properly caring for a pet. With modern life's fast-paced nature and various commitments, such as work and family, owning a pet can be challenging for some individuals. Adam may also be aware of the significant responsibility that comes with being a pet owner, and perhaps he has decided that the timing is not right. Another possible reason for Adam's lack of pets at home is allergies or health concerns. For example, Adam may be allergic to pet dander, in which case owning a pet would be detrimental to his health. Other health-related concerns could involve family members or frequent visitors who may have allergies or other risks that pets may pose. Lastly, Adam may be content with simply interacting with animals outside of owning a pet. This could include going on nature walks and observing wildlife, visiting farms and sanctuaries, and even volunteering at animal shelters in his spare time. In this way, Adam can enjoy the company of animals without the substantial responsibility that accompanies owning a pet. In summary, while both Samuel and Adam love animals, their lifestyle choices and personal circumstances have led to their differing pet ownership situations. Samuel, who cherishes the presence of his dogs, has taken considerable steps to create a loving and safe environment for them. On the other hand, Adam, although animal-loving, does not own any pets due to various reasons such as lack of time, resources, health-related concerns, or an alternative way of engaging with animals. Regardless of these differences, their shared love for animals fosters empathy and appreciation for the natural world around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 2: Is the mean for a stable distribution the same as the mean for Gaussian or normal distribution when the index of stability, alpha >1? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What is the difference between Gaussian and normal distribution? The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a continuous probability distribution. They are essentially the same thing, with the terms used interchangeably. This distribution has a unique bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric around its mean and characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The probability density function (PDF) of the Gaussian distribution is given by the formula: f(x) = (1 / √(2πσ^2)) * e^(-(x - μ)^2 / (2σ^2)) Where x is the variable, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. The peak of the curve corresponds to the mean, and the spread of the curve is determined by the standard deviation. The Gaussian distribution is vital in statistics, as it often approximates the distribution of random variables and provides a foundation for numerous statistical tests, including hypothesis testing or regression analysis. It is also essential in understanding the Central Limit Theorem as it states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the random variables. Question 2: Is the mean for a stable distribution the same as the mean for Gaussian or normal distribution when the index of stability, alpha >1? A stable distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions, which is defined by four parameters: the location parameter (μ), the scale parameter (σ), the skewness parameter (β), and the index of stability (α). Stable distributions provide a generalization of several well-known distributions, including the Gaussian distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Lévy distribution. The mean of a stable distribution can be very different from the mean of a Gaussian distribution. Stable distributions are defined by their characteristic functions. Importantly, stable distributions have finite values for mean and variance when the index of stability α > 1. When 0 < α < 1, the mean and variance can be infinite and thus not well-defined. When α = 2, the stable distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution, so the mean would be the same. For 1 < α ≤ 2, the mean of a stable distribution will generally differ from the mean of a Gaussian distribution, as the properties of the distribution depend on the location, scale, skewness, and the index of stability parameters. To answer your final question, no, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the difference between Gaussian and normal distribution, which are essentially two names for the same distribution. Question 2, on the other hand, is exploring the comparison of the mean values between stable distributions and Gaussian distribution under a specific condition (when the index of stability α >1). These questions are about distinct aspects of the probability distribution concepts in statistics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Jorge de la Vega is best categorized under the \\"artist\\" category. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1930, de la Vega was an influential and versatile Latin American artist primarily known for his work in painting and drawing. He was a key member of the Nueva Figuración (New Figuration) movement in Argentina during the 1960s, a time characterized by political tensions and artistic experimentation in Latin America. Jorge de la Vega's artwork reflected the social and political context of his time, often engaging in themes of alienation and anguish experienced by individuals living under oppressive regimes. His style was characterized by a confluence of abstraction and figuration, combining expressionist, neo-figurative, and neo-surrealist elements. Over the years, he explored various mediums, including painting, drawing, collage, and assemblage, while experimenting with tonal ranges and compositions. In addition to his artistic practice, de la Vega was a trained architect and musician, which contributed to his interdisciplinary approach to art. His depictions were often populated by fantastical figures, striving to address the human condition and the complexities of modern society. His work has been exhibited and collected worldwide, with a lasting impact on the Latin American art scene. Sadly, Jorge de la Vega passed away in 1971 at the age of 40, but his legacy as a pioneering artist endures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the context: What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: pack up all their belongings, invite their parents to move in, get hired for a new job Answer:","completion":"Before moving back home to live with their parents, Aubrey needs to pack up all their belongings. This is an important step in the process since it will help them transition smoothly into their new living situation and allow them to have access to all their personal items while staying with their parents. First, Aubrey should take some time to reflect on what they want to bring with them to their parents' house and what items they may be able to leave behind, sell, or donate. They should consider the space available at their parents' home and only take what they truly need or find essential. Once they have an idea of what belongings they want to bring with them, Aubrey should start sorting their items by category. This process will make it easier for them to pack their belongings efficiently and ensure that everything is organized and easily accessible when they unpack at their parents' house. Typical categories could include clothing, shoes, books, electronics, kitchen items, and toiletries. Aubrey should also take this opportunity to declutter their belongings and get rid of any items they no longer need or use. This could mean donating items to charity, selling them online, or simply disposing of them responsibly. By decluttering, Aubrey will be able to focus on the essentials and make their move as smooth and streamlined as possible. Next, Aubrey should start packing their belongings into appropriate containers. They can use cardboard boxes, plastic bins, or even bags and suitcases, as long as they provide enough protection and organization for their items. It's essential to label each container with its contents and the room it belongs in, making the unpacking process easier when they arrive at their parents' house. Aubrey should also take care to pack breakable and valuable items properly to prevent any damage during the move. They can wrap these items in bubble wrap, packing paper, or even soft fabrics like blankets and towels. Additionally, it's essential to communicate with their parents about any large items or furniture pieces they plan on bringing, so that adequate space and arrangements can be made at their parents' home. Once everything is packed, Aubrey should arrange for transportation of their belongings to their parents' house. They can either rent a moving truck, enlist the help of friends with vehicles, or hire professional movers to assist with the heavy lifting. Finally, it's essential for Aubrey to communicate openly with their parents about any concerns or expectations they may have regarding living together. This can help address any potential issues before they arise and may even foster a more harmonious living environment that will make this difficult life transition a bit easier for everyone involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Released from jail in February last year under strict bail conditions. Received over £500,000 in legal aid in ten-year battle with Government. Article:","completion":"Title: North London Man Re-arrested after Receiving £500,000 in Legal Aid amidst Terrorism Concerns Introduction: A 52-year-old man from North London has been arrested by specialist counter-terrorism officers, after receiving over £500,000 in legal aid during his decade-long battle with the government. The man was previously released from jail in February last year under strict bail conditions. Step 1: Discuss the arrest and raid On Thursday, the man was led away in handcuffs from his North London home after a raid by specialist counter-terrorism officers. The reason for the arrest and raid remains undisclosed by the authorities, raising serious concerns amidst the community. Step 2: Highlight his previous imprisonment and release The individual was previously imprisoned, but was released in February last year under strict bail conditions. It is currently unclear whether he had violated these bail conditions that led to the recent arrest, or if he is facing new charges. Step 3: Discuss his legal aid and battle with the government During his ten-year struggle with the government, the North London man received over £500,000 in legal aid. Legal aid is a government funded program designed to help individuals who cannot afford to pay for legal representation in court. However, it has become a topic of public debate, with some people arguing that it should be limited to those who truly need financial assistance. Step 4: Analyze the consequences of the arrest on public opinion and concerns This recent arrest highlights the growing concerns around terrorism in the UK. The use of specialist counter-terrorism officers during the raid indicates that the authorities are taking this matter seriously. It also raises questions about the efficiency of the legal aid system, given that £500,000 was spent on this individual's legal battle with the government. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, the undisclosed reason for the arrest and the involvement of specialist counter-terrorism officers in the North London man's case have sparked both public concern and debate. Some argue that the significant sum of money spent on legal aid for this individual could have been allocated to more deserving cases or services. As more information becomes available, it will be crucial to analyze its implications on the legal aid system and counter-terrorism efforts in the UK."},{"prompt":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young woman walks through the hallways of an apartment building, looking for \\"Mr. Gunther\\".

Escapes - Visiting the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond - washingtonpost.com It was a dark and gloomy day when I undertook my Edgar Allan Poe pilgrimage, my soul filled with a rising dread for the unknown horrors I felt awaited me. Ever since discovering I shared a birthday with the great writer, I had become convinced that some malign influence was ineluctably drawing me to the hideous heart of a foul, unspeakable mystery. And in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth, there will be more reason than ever to go to Richmond, where he lived a third of his life. In various cities he lived in or visited, there will be exhibitions, book signings, lectures and performances, but the heart of the mania will be Richmond's Edgar Allan Poe Museum, which claims the world's finest collection of Poe manuscripts, letters, first editions and personal belongings. I tried in vain to think of another writer who has remained so popular for so long. Only Shakespeare and Dickens came to mind, and my purpose remained clear. All those Poe poems and stories came flooding back, haunting me with their cunning titles: \\"The Raven,\\" \\"Annabel Lee,\\" \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\" On arriving in Richmond, my eyes fell upon a decrepit building at 15th and Main streets. The site had once held the offices of the Southern Literary Messenger, where Poe, as editor, began to establish a lasting reputation. The building now houses a seedy \\"gentleman's club.\\" Was this, I wondered, a subtle clue, or simply a mocking symbol of depravity? It scarcely mattered, because as I in morbid fascination entered the old Shockoe Bottom neighborhood, looking for that air of decay that had lately hung over this erstwhile commercial area, I was mildly disappointed. The late-19th-century tobacco warehouses and factories have been converted into restaurants, nightclubs, shops and apartments. All very nice . . . yet (I smiled inwardly) still retaining an unvarnished flavor of antiquity. A few blocks away, the Poe Museum is centered on a decidedly pre-Poe building, the Old Stone House. Dating from the mid-1700s, it's the oldest residence in Richmond, and though Poe didn't live here, he would certainly have recognized it. A camellia was blooming when I visited, though the rose bushes were bare. Exhibits are located in the house and three other buildings. One exhibit details Poe's early life and includes his narrow bed and furniture from his foster parents' house. Poe's father abandoned his mother when the boy was 2; his mother died of tuberculosis the following year when she was in Richmond with a traveling theater company. Tobacco merchant John Allan and his wife took in Poe and gave him the best schooling money could buy. As a young boy Poe may have been a satisfactory addition to the household, but Allan described the teenage Poe as \\"that damn actor's son,\\" a \\"quite miserable, sulky, & ill-tempered\\" youth. He excluded Poe from his will. In fact, as museum director Kat Spears told me, Poe was a complex character, torn between his poor roots and his privileged upbringing. His early friends remembered him as a leader who often got his followers in trouble, a young man who was by turns capricious, imperious and generous, yet \\"not steadily kind or even amiable.\\" He famously married his 13-year-old cousin when he was 27; she would die at age 24, another crushing blow. As for his reputation as a drunk, Spears maintains that such a depiction is incomplete: \\"A lot of young people who come here . . . sometimes have the idea that alcohol makes you more creative. What we stress is that he was a disciplined writer: He didn't drink and write.\\" She likens his mood swings to bipolar behavior. \\"He drank to buoy himself at times.\\" Spears told me this as we stood in a room that holds samples of his tight, neat handwriting and a leather trunk that contained nearly all his worldly belongings: clothes, a mirror and manuscripts. It was left in his room in Richmond when he took a trip to Philadelphia in 1849. After stopping in Baltimore for reasons unknown, Poe was found outside a tavern in a delirium. He was taken to a hospital and, never regaining full consciousness, died four days later, at age 40; the coroner termed the cause of death \\"congestion of the brain.\\" Over the years various theories regarding his death have been proposed: epilepsy, rabies, heart attack, diabetes, alcohol poisoning and murder, to name but a few. There is no definitive answer, nor is there an answer to the mystery of Poe the man, though the museum helps you understand him better. I ended my tour in the gift shop, amid Poe action figures and shot glasses. I asked museum curator Chris Semtner why people still care about Poe after two centuries. \\"His works are still modern,\\" he said. \\"Everybody has to read him in school, and he's the first writer they actually like. His works explore the deepest recesses of the human mind. He's the quintessential outsider and rebel, and people sympathize with that.\\" Events and education coordinator Kappy Anklam could not help chipping in her thoughts, noting that lots of Goths visit the museum, attracted by Poe's obsession with the weird and morbid. The museum plans a 24-hour birthday bash on Jan. 19. But any time is a good time to go to Richmond and delve into America's first great lyric poet, inventor of the modern detective story and early master of the macabre. As for myself, from that numinous chamber I fled, aghast. I cannot give tongue to what I found there. Yet I would not hesitate to return. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The writer shares their experience of visiting the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond.

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before. Question: Bill opened the shop so early in the day because _ . Options: A: he liked to do as much as possible before he went to work B: the shop had to be open when the morning papers came C: he was never sure of time D: it was then that he did a lot of business A:","completion":"The correct answer is D: it was then that he did a lot of business. The article mentions that Bill Javis opened his news-agency at six in the morning to catch the early trade since his shop was conveniently located for city workers who were on their way to the station. So, it seems that opening the shop early in the morning allowed him to cater to this group of customers, thus doing a lot of business during these hours. Even though the papers arrive before he opens the shop (which could suggest option B), the article clearly states that his customer base mainly consists of city workers who most probably pick up their papers on their way to work in the morning. Therefore, the main reason for opening early seems to be to cater to these city workers – hence option D being the best answer. Option A could be misleading as there's no detail suggesting that Bill liked to do a lot before working in the shop, and option C is not relevant since Bill was actually very punctual, as emphasized by his habit of carrying an alarm clock around with him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him. To prevent this, HanshirÅ's closest friend performed seppuku and left a letter assigning to HanshirÅ the guardianship of his teenage sonâMotome.

Input: Context: The main objective of the present study was the investigation of possible influence of lens opacification on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements.', 'Eighty-six eyes of 64 patients (mean age 73.4 ± 8.3 years) were included in the study. MPOD was prospectively measured using the one-wavelength reflection method (Visucam500, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) before and after cataract extraction, with implantation of a blue-light filtering intraocular lens (AlconSN60WF). The median of the maximum optical density (MaxOD) and the median of the mean optical density (MeanOD) measurements of macular pigment across the subject group were evaluated.', 'Statistically significant differences were noticed between pre-operative and post-operative measurements, the absolute values were generally lower after cataract extraction. The following median (lower/upper quartile) differences across the group were determined: MaxOD -33.8 % (-46.2 to -19.1 %), MeanOD -44.0 % (-54.6 to -26.6 %). Larger changes were observed in elderly patients [<70 years of age (nu2009=u200925 eyes): MaxOD -13.4 % (-20.5 to 3.6 %), MeanOD -23.6 % (-30.5 to -15.3 %) versus patients ≥70 years (nu2009=u200961 eyes) MaxOD -40.5 % (-53.2 to -30.1 %), MeanOD -47.2 % (-57.8 to -40.1 %)] and in patients with progressed stage of cataract. MaxOD for lens opacification grade 1 (nu2009=u20099 eyes): -27.4 % (-42.1 to -19.6 %), grade 2 (nu2009=u200926 eyes): -35.0 % (-44.2 to -25.3 %), grade 3 (nu2009=u200921 eyes): -34.4 % (-45.4 to -11.4 %), grade 4 (nu2009=u200925 eyes): -32.6 % (-53.2 to -6.4 %), and grade 5 (nu2009=u20095 eyes): -53.5 % (-61.7 to -38.7 %) and MeanOD for cataract stage 1 (nu2009=u20099 eyes): -42.6 % (-46.0 to -26.0 %), stage 2 (nu2009=u200926 eyes): -44.1 % (-51.8 to -26.2 %), stage 3 (nu2009=u200921 eyes): -45.7 % (-54.7 to -24.7 %), stage 4 (nu2009=u200925 eyes): -39.5 % (-59.4 to -26.1 %), and stage 5 (nu2009=u20095 eyes): -57.0 % (-66.1 to -51.4 %). Answer: As established by comparison of pre- to post-operative measurements, cataract presented a strong effect on MPOD measured by one-wavelength reflection method. Particular care should therefore be taken when evaluating MPOD using this method in elderly patients with progressed stage of cataract. Future optimization of correcting parameters of scattered light and consideration of cataract influence may allow more precise evaluation of MPOD.

How do you do this: To prevent cookies from burning.","completion":"To prevent cookies from burning, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Choose the right recipe: Start by selecting a recipe that has been tested and reviewed by others. This ensures that the measurements and cooking times are correct, which can help prevent burning. 2. Measure ingredients accurately: Carefully measure all the ingredients, as too much sugar or butter can cause the cookies to burn. Using a kitchen scale for measuring dry ingredients can improve accuracy. 3. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. An oven that is too hot can cause cookies to burn quickly. 4. Use a light-colored baking sheet: Dark-colored baking sheets can absorb more heat and may lead to burnt cookies. Choose light-colored or aluminum baking sheets for more even heating. 5. Line your baking sheet: Line your baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This prevents cookies from sticking to the sheet and makes it easier to remove them without breaking, which can help prevent overcooking. 6. Space cookies properly: Leave enough space between each cookie on the baking sheet, as this allows for proper heat distribution and prevents the edges from burning. 7. Be mindful of baking time: Pay close attention to the baking time specified in the recipe. Begin checking cookies a few minutes before the given time to prevent overbaking. Note that oven temperatures may vary, so it's essential to know your oven. 8. Use an oven thermometer: To ensure that your oven is heating to the correct temperature, consider using an oven thermometer. This can help you adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning. 9. Rotate the baking sheet: Halfway through the baking time, rotate the sheet 180 degrees to ensure even cooking and reduce the risk of burning. 10. Transfer cookies immediately: Once the cookies are done, remove them from the oven and gently slide the parchment paper or silicone mat onto a wire cooling rack. This prevents the cookies from continuing to cook on the hot baking sheet. By following these steps and being attentive to your cookies as they bake, you can minimize the risk of burning and ensure they come out perfectly cooked and delicious."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish traveler James Bruce reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from Abyssinia, noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict. The Bahre-Nagassi (\\"Kings of the Sea\\") alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances. Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal's forces, but later joined the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire front against Abyssinia in 1572. That 16th century also marked the arrival of the Ottomans, who began making inroads in the Red Sea area. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What determined whether The Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians?","completion":"The determination of whether the Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians mainly depended on the geopolitical circumstances and the shifting balance of power in the region. There were several factors that influenced their alliances, some of which include: 1. Protection of territorial sovereignty: The Bahre-Nagassi, being the rulers of the Medri Bahri region, always aimed at protecting their territorial sovereignty. If they felt threatened by the Abyssinians or believed that an alliance with Abyssinia would compromise their interests, they would choose to fight against them. 2. Religious affiliations: While both the Medri Bahri and Abyssinian kingdoms shared a common Christian faith, which at times brought them together against the Muslim invasion, religious affiliations also played a role in determining alliances. If the Bahre-Nagassi saw an opportunity to strengthen their Christian position through an alliance with the Abyssinians, or if they faced a significant Muslim threat, such as during the campaigns of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, they would join forces with Abyssinia. 3. Balance of power: Regional power dynamics influenced the Bahre-Nagassi's decision to side with or against the Abyssinians. If aligning with the Abyssinians would weaken a more formidable enemy or if the Bahre-Nagassi deemed the Abyssinian kingdom to be weakened and vulnerable, they might join forces or fight against them, respectively. 4. Influence of foreign powers: The arrival of the Ottomans in the Red Sea region and their increasing influence in the area played a significant role in shaping the alliances and conflicts between the Medri Bahri and the Abyssinians. The Bahre-Nagassi sided with the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire against Abyssinia in 1572, reflecting the impact of foreign powers on their decision-making process. 5. Diplomatic relations and political marriages: Diplomatic relations between the two Christian kingdoms also played a part in determining their alliances or conflicts. Political marriages between the ruling families, the exchange of tributes, or agreements over the disputed territories often led to peaceful relations and alliances against common enemies. In conclusion, the determination of whether the Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians was not based on a single factor, but rather on a complex interplay of various geopolitical circumstances, religious affiliations, the regional balance of power, and the influence of foreign powers. The Bahre-Nagassi's primary focus was to protect their own interests and sovereignty, and their alliances and conflicts were shaped accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: Why did Jesse do this? A:","completion":"Given the context, it seems like Jesse decided to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party with the ulterior motive of trying to woo or flirt with her. Although the motives behind a person's actions can vary widely and greatly depend on their morals, values, intentions, and emotions, in this given scenario, Jesse's actions seem to be driven by an attraction or interest towards Lee's girlfriend. According to the information provided, Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home wasn't born from kindness, altruism, duty, or responsibility, but rather from an intention to try to make advances towards her. It could be that Jesse is attracted to Lee's girlfriend, and saw an opportunity to be alone with her to provide him with the chance to hit on her subtly or openly. This could mean anything from romantic gestures, flirtatious compliments, or the suggestion of interest that exceeds a platonic level. Taking her home from the party gave him a moment of privacy and it's likely that he used this as an opportunity to win her affections or express his feelings, possibly hoping to create a personal connection or foster a romantic interest in him. This could be perceived as a strategic move in Jesse's mind, believing it may increase his chances with her. However, it's also key to note that attempting to hit on someone else's partner is generally regarded as disrespectful and improper. It disrupts existing relationships, and, depending on the circumstances, it may negatively impact the bonds between Lee, his girlfriend, and Jesse. Furthermore, the fact that Lee and Jesse know each other may complicate matters further, since if Lee discovers Jesse's intentions, it might strain or damage their relationship. So, in summary, Jesse gave Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party because he fancied her and saw it as an opportunity to hit on her while they were alone.

Take that one cup of raisins in the original recipe and cut it in half. Now figure out what you want to replace it with! The following options will all go nicely with the raisins, but you can just as easily substitute these ingredients for all of the raisins if you wanted to: Chocolate chips or chunks (white and dark chocolate go particularly well) Chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds Dried cranberries This thick, rich, and dark syrup matches beautifully with the spiced flavors of a good oatmeal raisin cookie. This fantastic cookie takes all of the joys of a good oatmeal raisin cookie and blasts it with a fresh, spiced, and always delicious burst of sweet Indian spices. Add the following spices and, if you're really feeling culinary, let the raisins steep in a cup of chai tea for 15 minutes as well: 1 teaspoon each of cardamom, cinnamon, ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon each of ground ginger, nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Both sweet and savory, the addition of vanilla salt, often sold as \\"vanilla fleur de sel,\\" will bring out a richness and slight saltiness that will elevate the cookies from simple desert to decadent snack. The texture will stay roughly the same, but you'll get the sweet, slightly tropical touch of coconut flavor that will take any guests by welcome surprise. You can add as much or as little as you want, though at least 1-1/2 cups of oats is best to help the cookies keep their shape. You won't need the hand mixer, and can instead mix by hand. Add the following ingredients together and mix until it forma a paste, then mix in everything else like normal: 1/2 cup applesauce 4 tablespoons almond butter 4 tablespoons ground flax seed","completion":"This article suggests modifying oatmeal raisin cookie recipes by replacing half of the raisins with various ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried cranberries and experimenting with Indian spices, vanilla salt, coconut, and a healthier applesauce-almond butter mixture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Whether the first sentence is true does not necessarily confirm the truth of the second sentence. The first sentence says that \\"Milopotamos is one of the best and busiest beaches in the Aegean.\\" This statement indicates that Milopotamos is a favored beach among many in the Aegean Sea region, attracting a significant number of visitors. However, the second sentence generalizes all beaches in the Aegean, saying that \\"All of the beaches on the Aegean are popular and busy.\\" Even though the first sentence tells us that Milopotamos is a popular and busy beach, this does not mean that all beaches on the Aegean Sea are also as popular or busy as Milopotamos. The Aegean Sea, part of the eastern Mediterranean, is known for its large number of islands (and thus, beaches) divided between Greece and Turkey. While some are indeed popular tourist destinations known for their beauty, facilities, or historical significance like Milopotamos, others might be less well-known, less accessible, or less popular for a variety of reasons. For example, a beach might be less busy due to its remote location, lack of facilities, or absence of unique or appealing characteristics. In other words, just because one beach in the Aegean (Milopotamos) is bustling and popular does not mean that every other beach in the Aegean is the same. Popularity and visitor numbers can vary greatly from beach to beach, depending on multiple factors such as location, facilities, promotions by travel agencies, beauty of the beach, historical importance, and the presence of local or unique elements. Therefore, the truth of the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The popularity and busyness of Milopotamos do not necessarily reflect the state of the rest of the beaches in the Aegean Sea. The second sentence would only be true if every single beach in the Aegean Sea was indeed popular and busy, which isn't stipulated or guaranteed by the information provided in the first sentence.

Available choices: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","completion":"c). no; The premise clearly specifies that the General Services Administration's (GSA) fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address several long-standing problems identified by the GSA Inspector General. This proposition directly contradicts the hypothesis: \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\" In the logical framework of this scenario, if all problems were truly addressed in the plan, there would be no issues left unresolved. However, it is evident from the premise that this is not the case, as it points out the fact that the plan lack solutions for several ongoing issues flagged by the GSA Inspector General. Insofar as this specified context is concerned, the fact that some problems have been left untreated categorically negates the validity of the universal statement made in the hypothesis that 'All problems are addressed in the plan.' Generalized exposition as made in the hypothesis can only stand true if every single individual element it refers to adheres to the described condition. As it is apparent, a number of problems identified have not been addressed. Therefore, the hypothesis falls through, and the best-fit answer to the question 'does the premise entail the hypothesis that all problems are addressed in the plan' is 'No.' An important aspect to remember when interpreting statements such as these is to note the absolutes, like 'all' in this case. The absolute condition leaves no room for exceptions. Therefore, even a single instance where the condition is not met provides suffice substantiation for the diction of the entire statement. As a result, the premise that the General Services Administration's fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address certain ongoing problems directly contradicts and disaffirms the hypothesis that all problems are addressed in the plan.

Cat anatomy Cats have seven cervical vertebrae like almost all mammals, thirteen thoracic vertebrae (humans have twelve), seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five), three sacral vertebrae (humans have five because of their bipedal posture), and, except for Manx cats and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three caudal vertebrae (humans have three to five, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings. OPT: 1. no 2. yes Is this statement correct \\"are there bones in a cat's tail\\"?","completion":"Yes, this statement is correct. There are bones in a cat's tail. The bones in a cat's tail are called caudal vertebrae. Most cats have between 22 and 23 caudal vertebrae that form their tail. These vertebrae give the tail its structure and flexibility, allowing the cat to use it for balance and communication. Each vertebra is separated by an elastic disc which helps to cushion the impact during jumps or other sudden movements. In addition to the caudal vertebrae, a cat’s tail contains muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels that all contribute to the tail's functionality. Cats use their tails for expressing emotions, maintaining balance, and enhancing agility while moving through their environment. It is important to note that some breeds of cats, such as the Manx, have shorter tails or possess no tail at all due to a genetic mutation. In these cases, the number of caudal vertebrae would be lesser than the typical range of 22 to 23 bones. Overall, the presence of bones in a cat's tail is a crucial element of a cat's anatomy, allowing it to navigate its surroundings with ease, convey emotions, and maintain balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947.

Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her doctor colleague Arnold Bluhm (Hubert KoundÃ©) is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have himself been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was gay. In flashbacks, we see how in London, Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and Amnesty activist. He falls in love with her and she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. Despite their loving marriage, Tessa keeps from Justin the reason why she approached him in the first place - to investigate a suspicious drug trial in Kenya and expose it. When Tessa starts getting too close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful pharmaceutical company, she and her colleague are brutally murdered.

The order implements a 25% reduction in water usage for cities and towns across the parched state. Vast areas of government-owned lawns will be replaced by drought-tolerant landscaping, and towns will be banned from watering ornamental grass. Last year, Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a state of emergency after years of drought. The snow in the mountains is at its lowest level since records began, so water supplies from melting snow will be lower than normal in coming months. \\"We are standing on dried grass, and we should be standing in five feet of snow,\\" said Mr Brown, speaking in the Sierra Nevada mountains. \\"People should realise we're in a new era. The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day - that's going to be a thing of the past,\\" he said. The new order will require university campuses, cemeteries, golf courses and other large landowners to make major cuts in their water usage. Farmers in the United States' largest farm state have been hit hard in recent years. But Mr Brown's critics said his order did not go far enough to address agricultural use of water. \\"In the midst of a severe drought, the governor continues to allow corporate farms and oil interests to deplete and pollute our precious groundwater resources that are crucial for saving water,'' said Adam Scow, California director of the group Food & Water Watch.

Question: The best place for the troublemaker to sneak a smoke while he was in where, was in the bathroom? Options: - playground - school - at hotel - theater - convenience store Explain why a human would choose \\"school\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human might choose \\"school\\" as the best place for the troublemaker to sneak a smoke for several reasons. It's important to note that smoking, especially for underage individuals, is harmful and not encouraged. The following explanation is an analysis of why a person might choose \\"school\\" among the given options, rather than promoting such behavior. 1. Familiarity with the environment: In a school setting, the troublemaker is likely to be more familiar with the layout of the building, as well as the typical routines and schedules. This knowledge of their surroundings can help them identify suitable hiding spots and timings for sneaking a smoke without getting caught. 2. Greater number of potential locations: A school often has many secluded areas such as empty classrooms, stairwells, or storage areas where one could sneak a smoke. In comparison, the other options like a playground, hotel, or convenience store might have fewer spots to hide and limited opportunities to avoid being seen. 3. Established gatherings of peers: Schools are a place where youths spend a significant amount of time, and friends or groups of acquaintances might provide a support network that could aid or at least not report the act of sneaking a smoke. This sense of camaraderie might encourage the troublemaker to sneak a smoke in school rather than in locations where they are less likely to encounter supportive peers, like a hotel or convenience store. 4. School bathrooms: School bathrooms provide a relatively private space where a troublemaker can sneak a smoke. The bathroom stalls offer privacy, making it harder for authorities or other students to witness the act. Moreover, running water from the sink or the presence of air fresheners can help dissipate the smell of smoke, reducing the chances of getting caught. 5. Opportunity to exploit gaps in supervision: Schools often have multiple staff members on duty, who divide their attention among a large number of students. This distribution of supervision might make it easier for a troublemaker to slip away unnoticed and find an opportunity to sneak a smoke compared to being under the watchful eye of a single supervisor in a theater, hotel, or convenience store. In conclusion, while none of the mentioned options should be considered appropriate places for sneaking a smoke, a human might choose \\"school\\" as the answer due to the various factors making it relatively more convenient and less risky for a troublemaker to find a secluded spot and avoid detection. However, it's crucial to emphasize that such behavior is harmful and should not be encouraged."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Q: You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \\"flipping\\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \\"flipping\\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \\"increase\\" to \\"decrease.\\" Background Paragraph: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loih. Story: Pete lived in Alaska, but visited his friend Julia from Hawaii very often. They had many mutual interests, including geology and earthquakes. A:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding causal or qualitative relationships. Usage: In the background paragraph, the causal relationship is between the location of the Hawaiian Islands in the chain and their age; the islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. It also describes the continuous eruption of Kilauea volcano since 1983. This is an important part of understanding the story and forming a question that requires both the background and the story to answer. Part #2: Identifying relevant elements in the story. Usage: Pete lives in Alaska, frequently visits Julia from Hawaii, and they both have an interest in geology and earthquakes. This sets the context for asking a question that is related to the geological facts provided in the background paragraph. Part #3: Creating a question that requires an understanding of the relationship. Usage: \\"Which of the following Hawaiian Islands would Pete and Julia most likely find the youngest volcanic rocks on, due to being the youngest island in the chain?\\" This question requires knowledge from the background paragraph, as it specifies that the Big Island of Hawaii is the youngest island in the chain. The story is required to understand Pete and Julia's interests in geology, which makes the question relevant to their situation. Part #4: Verifying if the question requires both the background and story to answer. Usage: Our question does require both the background paragraph and the story to answer because knowledge of which island is the youngest as well as Pete and Julia's interest in geology and earthquakes are necessary to understand the question. The background paragraph provides the information about the age of the islands, and the story establishes their interest in geology, making it necessary to have both components to answer the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177).

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits? is inside the article: Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the famous artist that decorated the hospital that was opened in 1991? Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information.

Paul read more about the lungs of mammals, while Pete read more about the lungs of frogs. Which student read less about a network of very small blood vessels? Hint: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!","completion":"Based on the hint provided, it can be concluded that Pete read less about a network of very small blood vessels since he focused on the lungs of frogs. In contrast, Paul read more about the lungs of mammals, which are specifically noted to have numerous tiny sac-like structures called alveoli that increase the surface area for gas exchange. The significance of alveoli in mammalian lungs, such as in humans, is their crucial role in facilitating effective gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels, and with around 300 million alveoli in each human lung, the total surface area for gas exchange within the lungs expands to an impressive 90 square meters (968 square feet), which is similar to one side of a volleyball court. On the other hand, the lungs of frogs have a simpler structure and lack the extensive network of small blood vessels and alveoli that are found in mammalian lungs. Frogs predominantly rely on cutaneous respiration, or breathing through their skin, to carry out a considerable portion of their gas exchange. This means that Pete, who read about the lungs of frogs, likely encountered less information about a network of very small blood vessels involved in the respiratory system compared to Paul, who studied the lungs of mammals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Latin American church group has apologized to the pope, saying it was greatly distressed that the document had been published; the audience was a private and unrecorded one, but the group's leadership team together wrote a synthesis of the points he had made for their own personal use.

His statement came during a meeting with a key Latin American church group on June 6, where the pontiff admitted to the presence of the lobby and expressed a need to address the issue, according to a synthesis of his remarks prepared by the group's leaders, the AP reports. Additionally, Francis referred to a \\"stream of corruption\\" within the Vatican, stating that he was relying on the eight cardinals he appointed to lead reform efforts. While admitting his own disorganization and lack of expertise in the matter, the pope expressed confidence in the cardinals' ability to move the reform forward. These comments bear a striking resemblance to the events surrounding Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, when Italian media reported that his decision was prompted by the \\"Vatileaks\\" dossier. This dossier allegedly unveiled a network of gay cardinals and priests who were being blackmailed, further pointing to corruption within the church. Following the publication of the document, the Latin American church group extended an apology to Pope Francis, expressing their distress over the exposure of the private and unrecorded discussion. The leadership team of the group collectively composed a synthesis of the points Francis made for their personal use, emphasizing that it is impossible to attribute specific expressions in the text to the pontiff but only to capture the general sense of his remarks. This unprecedented acknowledgment of the \\"gay lobby\\" by Pope Francis highlights the urgent need for transparency, accountability, and reform within the Catholic Church's hierarchy.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480.

National Integrating New and Existing Technology and Information Sharing into an Effective Homeland Security Strategy Does it follow that \\"An effective homeland security strategy involves new and existing technology.\\"? Available choices: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"A). Yes. An effective homeland security strategy indeed involves the integration of both new and existing technology. A detailed explanation can be provided through the examination of key aspects such as technology's role in information sharing, adaptation and evolution, inter-agency cooperation, and the overall enhancement of security operations. 1. Technology's Role in Information Sharing: Information sharing is critical to the success of homeland security strategy. The use of technology enables efficient, timely, and accurate data dissemination among various agencies and organizations. This is made possible through software platforms, digital communication systems, and data repositories. Integrating existing technology ensures that legacy systems are still supported, while new technology ensures that improvements and updates are promptly integrated into the system for a more robust communication infrastructure. 2. Adaptation and Evolution: An effective strategy must account for the dynamic nature of homeland security threats. This necessitates the continuous adaptation and evolution of technology and information systems to address emerging risks. Combining existing technology with new innovations keeps the entire system up-to-date and effective in managing threats. For instance, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning can be integrated for better threat analysis and response, building upon the infrastructure of already-existing databases and systems. 3. Inter-Agency Cooperation: A strong homeland security strategy depends on the collaboration of multiple stakeholders, such as law enforcement, first responders, intelligence agencies, and the military, among others. Ensuring that these diverse entities can seamlessly work together requires well-coordinated technological systems and standardized protocols. By harmoniously integrating new and existing technology, organizations can maximize the value of their collective resources and create a more effective homeland security strategy. 4. Enhancement of Security Operations: New and existing technology should be continuously harnessed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of homeland security operations. This would involve employing state-of-the-art surveillance systems, reconnaissance devices, and cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information. Likewise, existing technologies such as biometric systems, secure databases, and risk assessment tools must be consistently optimized and augmented with time. The fusion of new and existing technology serves as the foundation for an effective homeland security strategy that can adapt to a diverse range of threats. In conclusion, the integration of new and existing technology plays a crucial role in formulating and executing an effective homeland security strategy. By ensuring seamless information sharing, fostering adaptation and evolution, promoting inter-agency cooperation, and enhancing security operations, homeland security strategies are better equipped to mitigate threats and protect the nation's interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information given step-by-step: 1. Earth has mostly liquid water. 2. Water in Jupiter's moon Europa is in a frozen state. Now let's justify the answer using the given information: Water exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. In general, solid water (ice) has a lower density than liquid water because ice has a crystalline structure that is less compact than liquid water molecules. This is why ice floats on water. Since Earth has mostly liquid water and Europa has water in a frozen state, we can deduce that the state of water in Europa has a lower density than the state of water on Earth. The answer is: In Europa, the state of water is in a lower density than on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is having difficulties breathing happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a person is having difficulties breathing, this will indeed affect the process and may result in less oxygen being brought into the body. The process of breathing is essential for delivering oxygen to cells and removing carbon dioxide waste. This effect can be direct or indirect. Direct effects may include: 1. Airway obstruction or blockage: If the airway is obstructed or blocked by mucus, a foreign object, or due to inflammation caused by illness or allergies, air will not be able to reach the lungs efficiently. This will lead to reduced oxygen entering the body. 2. Reduced lung capacity: Various lung diseases and issues, such as asthma, emphysema, or pleural effusion, can affect the lung's capacity to expand, limiting the amount of oxygen that can be brought into the body. Indirect effects may include: 1. Issues with the diaphragm or chest wall muscles: If a person experiences difficulties in using their diaphragm or chest wall muscles properly, it will be harder to draw sufficient air into the lungs, ultimately affecting the amount of oxygen entering the body. 2. Unclean or contaminated air: If the air in the environment is polluted or contains low amounts of oxygen, this can result in less oxygen being available for uptake by the body. In summary, the supposed perturbation of difficulties breathing can have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen delivery to the body. Individuals experiencing such difficulties should seek medical attention to ensure their respiratory system is functioning properly and to receive appropriate treatment for any underlying conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Communications in Somalia encompasses the communications services and capacity of Somalia. Telecommunications, internet, radio, print, television and postal services in the nation are largely concentrated in the private sector. Several of the telecom firms have begun expanding their activities abroad. The Federal government operates two official radio and television networks, which exist alongside a number of private and foreign stations. Print media in the country is also progressively giving way to news radio stations and online portals, as internet connectivity and access increases. Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence. In 2012, a National Communications Act was also approved by Cabinet members, which lays the foundation for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. After the start of the civil war, various new telecommunications companies began to spring up in the country and competed to provide missing infrastructure. Somalia now offers some of the most technologically advanced and competitively priced telecommunications and internet services in the world. Funded by Somali entrepreneurs and backed by expertise from China, Korea and Europe, these nascent telecommunications firms offer affordable mobile phone and internet services that are not available in many other parts of the continent.

The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter.

Options: - think for himself - answer question - wait in line - speak a foreign language - cross road Explain why a human would choose \\"wait in line\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"wait in line\\" to answer the question above due to several key reasons related to the context of elementary school students entering a classroom, as well as the overarching principles of discipline, order, safety, and respect. When dealing with a group of young students, it is essential to maintain structure and organization to ensure an optimal learning environment. The act of waiting in line helps to achieve these goals and stands out as the most reasonable and relevant option among those provided. Firstly, waiting in line develops students' discipline and patience as they learn to respect the authority of the teacher and follow classroom routines. This sense of order prepares the students for the day's lessons and allows for an organized and streamlined transition from one activity to another. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity for any preliminary instructions, such as announcements, to be calmly shared by the teacher to a well-mannered group of students. Regarding safety, waiting in line significantly reduces the chances of accidents and injuries in the classroom and school corridors. By maintaining a calm and orderly flow of students entering the classroom, the risk of students pushing, shoving, or running (potentially leading to harm) is minimized. This ensures that everyone moves to their seats in a safe and orderly manner, avoiding congestion at the classroom entrance. Lastly, comparing the option of \\"wait in line\\" to the other options provided: - \\"Think for himself\\": While this is an essential skill for students to develop in the long run, it is not directly relevant to the context of students entering a classroom, and it does not address the issue of safety and orderliness. - \\"Answer question\\": Answering questions is certainly an integral part of a student's learning experience, but it is not specifically related to the task of entering a classroom, nor does it underline the importance of maintaining discipline and following routines. - \\"Speak a foreign language\\": Although learning foreign languages can be beneficial, it has no direct bearing on the process of entering the classroom, and it is not a universal requirement for students. - \\"Cross road\\": While road safety is important, the context of crossing a road is not relevant to students entering their classrooms within a school building. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"wait in line\\" as the best answer in this context because it exhibits the most relevance to the act of elementary school students going into class. By waiting in line, students can demonstrate respect, foster a sense of orderliness and discipline, focus on preparing for the day's lessons, and ensure personal and collective safety—thus, contributing to their overall growth and development, both as students and as responsible individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"2. yes Fascism is considered bad and wrong for several reasons, as it often has disastrous consequences for societies, individuals, and democratic structures. The following points delve into why fascism is perceived as negative: 1. Suppression of dissent: Fascism prioritizes the needs of the state over the rights of the individual, often leading to the suppression of dissenting viewpoints and curtailing free speech. This restricts open dialogue and critical thinking, which are vital for the healthy functioning of a democratic society. 2. Violation of human rights: Fascism has often been associated with the systematic violation of human rights. The belief in racial superiority, extreme nationalism and totalitarian control over the population, has led to cases of persecution, mass deportations, and genocide. Notable examples include Nazi Germany's Holocaust and Italy's colonial atrocities during World War II. 3. Authoritarian rule: Fascist regimes are characterized by absolute power and authority, which has historically led to widespread corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power. Such autocratic structures disregard the well-being of citizens, obstruct political accountability, and hinder the establishment of a fair legal system. 4. Stifling of innovation and creativity: Fascism's emphasis on conformity and adherence to a single, \\"correct\\" ideology suppresses artistic, intellectual, and creative pursuits. This not only restricts individual growth but also hinders society's progress, as dissent and differing perspectives often serve as the catalysts for new ideas and innovation. 5. Limited social cohesion: Fascist ideologies promote the notion of \\"us versus them,\\" leading to the marginalization, discrimination, and persecution of those who do not fit the perceived ideal. This creates a climate of fear, hate, and distrust, which undermines social cohesion and can result in social unrest and divisions. 6. War and militarism: Historically, fascist regimes have pursued aggressive expansionist policies, which have contributed to conflicts and war. This warmongering not only causes the loss of millions of lives but also diverts resources from essential services and infrastructure development to military pursuits, further impacting the quality of life of citizens in these countries. 7. Economic inefficiencies: Fascist regimes often have planned economies or rely on heavy state control, which can result in inefficient allocation of resources, corruption, and economic instability. Combined with a focus on militarism and war, this can lead to a precarious economic climate and reduced access to essential goods and services. In conclusion, fascism is considered bad and wrong due to its oppression of individual freedom, perpetuation of inequalities, and devastating impact on society, both socially and economically. Its inherently negative qualities have led to war, violence, and numerous human rights violations throughout history, solidifying its reputation as an undesirable and harmful political ideology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The piano is very heavy and unfortunately he isn't strong enough to lift it up his front steps. A friend of his suggests he get a ramp since it will support part of the weight allowing him to push it into his house much easier. Adam gets the ramp and successfully pushes the piano in to his new house. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which would be easier, pick up a large object and carrying it or pushing it on a ramp?. Hint: The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. On the other hand, the output force is greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance. Like other simple machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is given by Answer:","completion":"Pushing it on a ramp would be easier. The inclined plane (ramp) supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope, reducing the amount of force required to move the object uphill. Although the object needs to be moved over a greater distance, it requires lesser effort compared to lifting and carrying the large object."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated.

A sixteen-year-old Chinese martial artist, Ling Xiaoyu was tutored by her elderly relative, Wang Jinrei, at a young age; he believed that she could achieve true greatness, yet was frustrated by her flippant attitude. While vacationing with her family in Hong Kong, she notices a company yacht owned by the Mishima Zaibatsu. Aware of the corporation's worldwide influence, she boldly stows away on the vessel in hopes of meeting Heihachi Mishima and making her dream of owning an amusement park reality. However, she is discovered by Heihachis personal security, the Tekken Force, but when Heihachi arrives after being summoned, all his men are seen beaten and scattered across the deck.

Faces - Although it is true that human eyes are located on a person's face, the term \\"faces\\" is broad and could include faces of different species or even inanimate objects, making it less specific and accurate than the term \\"person's head.\\" 2. Potato - This choice is incorrect because a potato is a starchy vegetable and bears no relation to the human eye. Eyespots, or \\"eyes\\" on potatoes, are buds that can grow into new plants, but they are not comparable to human eyes. 3. Mammal - While humans are indeed a type of mammal and have eyes, this option is too general. There are many mammals with eyes, such as dogs, cats, and cows. The phrase \\"person's head\\" narrows down the specific location of a human eye within the various types of mammals. 4. Skull - A human skull is the bony structure that forms the head's shape and supports the face. Although a skull contains eye sockets, it does not actually have the human eye itself.

The initiative, established by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sought to encourage groundbreaking advancements in toilet design that would cater to the 2.5 billion individuals worldwide who lack adequate sanitation solutions. To further expand on the subject, the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge not only addressed a major global health and environmental issue but also provided a platform for researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs to come together and create systems that can function off the grid, without access to water, sewer, or electrical connections. This was done by encouraging the development of new approaches, such as self-contained sanitation systems that treated waste on site or converted human waste into energy or valuable resources like fertilizer. Over the years, several grants have been awarded to researchers and teams worldwide to develop their innovative solutions and prototypes. One notable result of the challenge is the \\"Omni Processor\\", which converts sewage into clean drinking water, electricity, and pathogen-free ash. Many of these cutting-edge technologies offer the potential to fundamentally change the way sanitation is managed, especially in developing nations where infrastructure and resources are limited. In conclusion, the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge was launched in 2011 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the goal of revolutionizing the sanitation industry and improving global health and environmental outcomes.

The Real manager left captain Sergio Ramos, as well as midfielders Casemiro and Luka Modric, out of his starting line-up, with one eye on the match in Manchester. It looked set to backfire after a quarter of an hour, against a Rayo side looking for revenge after being beaten 10-2 at the Bernabeu in December. Paco Jemez's side, who are battling to avoid relegation to the Segunda Division, were much more of a match for their Madrid neighbours this time, but ultimately ran out of steam. Embarba struck for the home side after excellent work down the left from former Manchester United forward Bebe, although Miku also deserved credit for a dummy run that drew defender Danilo to the near post to create space for the scorer. Real's back line looked disorganised, and conceded a second from a corner as Raphael Varane inadvertently flicked the ball on, and Miku turned in the loose ball from six yards.

Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Hatch has long been a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights, and introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1997. Hatch believes intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators. Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003 by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that \\"This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\\" In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch's official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that \\"We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.\\" Shortly after the publication of that story in Wired magazine, the company that runs Hatch's website contacted Milonic to start registration. One year later, he proposed the controversial INDUCE Act that attempted to make illegal all tools that could be used for copyright infringement if said tools were intentionally used for illegal copyright infringement. On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA).

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: NATO operative Jacques Kristoff (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is summoned into actionâon his birthday, no lessâto track down Galina Konstantin (Laura Harring), who has stolen an extremely valuable and dangerous top-secret cargo. Finding Galina doesn't take long, and Jacques must wrap up the mission by returning Galina and the contraband to his superiors by train. Jacques's physician wife Madeline (Susan Gibney) isn't happy about this turn of events, no doubt having invested a small fortune in a Berlitz correspondence course and a year of acting lessons for Jacques's birthday. But she sees him off at the train station with the couple's teenaged daughter Bailey Kristoff (Jessica Bowman) and son Ethan Kristoff (Kristopher Van Varenberg). It seems Galina's ill-gotten gain is three vials of SP-43, an ultra-virulent strain of smallpox, cultured in fluorescent green serum. It also seems that a group of terrorists, led by Mason Cole (Tomas Arana), intend to hijack the train and steal the virus for their own ends. But standing in their way is Jacques. The virus ends up getting loose in the train's ventilation system. Unfortunately, Jacques's family picked this special moment to surprise him for his birthday by tagging along for the ride. Jacques becomes a one-man army as he fights to protect his family and the other passengers, and stop Cole and his followers.

The number of letters in a word determine its length. For example, the length of the word \\"apple\\" is 5. Problem:Sentence: 'a person in full leather riding a motorcycle with a stuff animal on the back'. Reverse all words of length '3' in the given sentence. Solution:","completion":"1. Begin by identifying the words in the sentence that have the specified length, in this case, 3 letters. To do this, split the sentence into words. 2. Split the sentence into words by using the \\"split()\\" function. words = sentence.split() 3. Create a new empty list, which will be used to store the transformed words. reversed_words = [] 4. Loop through each word in the \\"words\\" list. 5. For each word, check if its length is equal to the specified length (3 letters in this example). 6. If the length of the current word is equal to the specified length, reverse the word using slicing. reversed_word = word[::-1] If the length of the word does not match the specified length, skip to the next word. 7. Add the reversed or unchanged word to the list \\"reversed_words\\". reversed_words.append(reversed_word) 8. After all words have been processed and added to the \\"reversed_words\\" list, join the words back together into a single string by using the \\"join()\\" function. final_sentence = \\" \\".join(reversed_words) 9. Return the final sentence with the reversed words of the specified length. In code, this solution looks like this: \`\`\`python def reverse_words(sentence, length): words = sentence.split() reversed_words = [] for word in words: if len(word) == length: reversed_word = word[::-1] else: reversed_word = word reversed_words.append(reversed_word) final_sentence = \\" \\".join(reversed_words) return final_sentence sentence = 'a person in full leather riding a motorcycle with a stuff animal on the back' result = reverse_words(sentence, 3) print(result) \`\`\` The output for this example would be: 'a person ni full leather gnidir a motorcycle htiw a stuff animal no eht back'"}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
