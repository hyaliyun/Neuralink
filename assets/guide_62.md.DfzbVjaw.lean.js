Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German. Question: \\"What are some reasons for uses of the Albanian language?\\" Answer: \\"Orthodox\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct for the question asked. Let me explain it in a simpler way. The Albanian language was used for different reasons. First, the language was part of the cultural renaissance, which means people started to care more about their own culture and history. This led to the development of the Albanian language in religious texts and publications, not just in the Catholic areas in the north but also in the Orthodox areas in the south. Also, a person named Gjon Buzuku brought the Catholic liturgy, which is a religious service, into the Albanian language. This was an important step for the growth and use of the Albanian language. So, the reasons for the use of the Albanian language are: the cultural renaissance, religious texts and publications, and the translation of the Catholic liturgy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas.

The explosion led to the tragic loss of 11 human lives and caused millions of gallons of crude oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico over the span of 87 days, heavily sabotaging the ecosystem, marine life, and local economies. At the helm of BP – the company operating the rig – was CEO Tony Hayward, whose response to the disaster garnered near-universal criticism and subsequent repercussions. In this article, we analyze Tony Hayward's fateful 100 days leading BP through the crisis and its ramifications. I: Crucial First Moments: The Veil of Ignorance When the explosion occurred, the primary goal was to ascertain the extent of the damage and begin formulating an appropriate response. At this point, certain disclosure inadequacies had already begun to surface. On April 24th, BP announced that approximately 1,000 barrels of oil were being leaked per day; however, this figure was heavily revised upward to almost 5,000 barrels per day on April 28th. This crucial period in leadership raised concerns about the clarity and transparency of information shared with authorities and the public. II: An Emergency Response: The Fight to Contain an Ecological Disaster As the urgency and magnitude of the problem set in, Tony Hayward and BP swung into action by attempting to implement damage control measures. These ranged from chemical dispersants that would break down the oil to a massive containment dome to capture the crude oil before it could spread further. Additionally, relief wells drilled to help stem the leak and a 'top kill' operation aimed at clogging the well with drilling mud were among the tactics utilized. During this period, Hayward frequently appeared in the media, assuring the public and government of BP's commitment to effectively addressing the crisis. However, conflicting opinions, lack of clarity on responsibility, and media gaffes would soon cast a long shadow on Hayward's leadership. III: Public Relations Nightmare: Tony Hayward's Missteps Hayward's communication style and some of his remarks during the tragedy undoubtedly drew negative attention, exacerbating public scrutiny. Statements such as \\"I'd like my life back\\" or downplaying the oil spill's environmental impact with comments like \\"the Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean\\" were perceived as insensitive, causing outrage and serious questions about his leadership style. Moreover, the perceived lack of empathy and absence of a strong message of accountability further dented Hayward's reputation. The infamous yachting incident – where he took a break during the crisis to go sailing on his yacht – compounded these issues, giving the impression that he was out of touch with the gravity of the situation and its reverberations on the American populace. IV: Presidential Lashings and Congressional Hearings Unsurprisingly, Hayward's response garnered the ire of US politicians. President Barack Obama stated that Hayward should have been fired after many of his comments, and the Department of Justice announced a criminal investigation into the disaster. During a congressional hearing, Hayward faced rigorous questioning from US congressmen and was criticized for deflecting responsibility and failing to answer direct questions about BP's safety measures and response to the accident. V: A Change in Leadership and Legacies On July 27, 2010, just 100 days after the explosion, Tony Hayward announced his resignation as CEO of BP. The company declared him as a \\"lightning rod\\" for criticism, and amidst immense pressure, Hayward stepped down with an effective date of October 1, 2010. Bob Dudley succeeded him, inheriting a monumental task of amending BP's global reputation and addressing the aftermath of the disaster. Conclusion: Lessons from 100 Turbulent Days In the confinement of these 100 days, Tony Hayward's leadership in the face of the Deepwater Horizon disaster serves as a cautionary tale for CEOs and emphasizes the significant impact of crisis management on public perception and future corporate prospects. Transparency in communication, empathy, preparedness, and a high level of personal accountability are critical lessons for corporations and individuals alike to imbibe from this event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking everything into consideration, then, the agricultural budget will next year require 0.48% of each Member State’s gross national income, and nearly 45% of the total European Budget. Translate to German","completion":"Unter Berücksichtigung all dieser Aspekte wird für das nächste Jahr voraussichtlich ein Agrarhaushalt erforderlich sein, der 0,48 % des Bruttonationaleinkommens jedes Mitgliedstaates und fast 45 % des gesamten Europäischen Haushalts ausmacht. Wenn man alles in Betracht zieht, wird der Agrarhaushalt im nächsten Jahr 0,48 % des Bruttonationaleinkommens jedes Mitgliedslandes benötigen und fast 45 % des gesamten europäischen Haushalts ausmachen. Die Landwirtschaft ist eine wichtige Säule der Wirtschaft in vielen europäischen Ländern, und der Agrarhaushalt trägt dazu bei, diese Vitalität aufrechtzuerhalten. Durch Investitionen in die Landwirtschaft und die ländliche Entwicklung soll die Lebensmittelversorgung sichergestellt, die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der europäischen Landwirtschaft gestärkt und die Entwicklung und Erhaltung ländlicher Räume unterstützt werden. Dabei spielt der Europäische Garantiefonds für die Landwirtschaft (EGFL) eine entscheidende Rolle, indem er den Landwirten Direktzahlungen zur Verfügung stellt und Marktmaßnahmen finanziert, während der Europäische Landwirtschaftsfonds für die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums (ELER) gezielte Investitionen und Kooperationen in ländlichen Gebieten ermöglicht. Die Landwirtschaftspolitik der Europäischen Union (EU) hat sich im Laufe der Zeit gewandelt und an die Bedürfnisse der Mitgliedstaaten sowie die globalen Herausforderungen angepasst. Die Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik (GAP) der EU hat sich seit ihrer Einführung in den 1960er Jahren von einer reinen Markt- und Preispolitik hin zu einem umfassenderen Ansatz entwickelt, der auch Umweltschutz, Tierwohl, Klimawandel und soziale Aspekte berücksichtigt. Die Reformen der GAP zielen darauf ab, die Nachhaltigkeit und Resilienz der Landwirtschaft zu verbessern und gleichzeitig den ökologischen Fußabdruck der Branche zu reduzieren. So sollen beispielsweise die Subventionen zunehmend an Umweltschutzmaßnahmen wie Bodenerhaltung, Wasserwirtschaft oder Biodiversität gekoppelt werden. Zusätzlich wird die EU auch Projekte unterstützen, die neue Technologien und innovative Lösungen für die Landwirtschaft fördern und so die Effizienz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit steigern. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die Verwendung von Präzisionslandwirtschaft, bei der satellitengestützte Systeme und Drohnen zum Einsatz kommen, um die Pflanzenproduktion effizienter und umweltverträglicher zu gestalten. Trotz der zunehmenden Bedeutung von Umweltschutz und Innovation bleibt die Sicherstellung einer fairen Einkommensverteilung für Landwirte einer der Hauptgründe für den beträchtlichen Agrarhaushalt der EU. Gerade in einer Zeit, in der viele ländliche Gebiete mit Problemen wie der Landflucht, demografischen Veränderungen und einer alternden Bevölkerung konfrontiert sind, ist es wichtig, den Erhalt der Landwirtschaft und ihrer Gemeinden zu gewährleisten. Letztendlich muss der Agrarhaushalt jedes Jahr sorgfältig abgewogen und an die jeweiligen Bedürfnisse und Herausforderungen angepasst werden. Dies ist notwendig, um eine nachhaltige, wettbewerbsfähige und umweltfreundliche Landwirtschaft in der EU zu gewährleisten und gleichzeitig die Lebensgrundlage der Landwirte und den sozialen Zusammenhalt in ländlichen Gebieten zu erhalten."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cuba holds large gay rights rally Monday, May 19th 2008, 10:20 AM Mariela Castro, center, daughter of Cuba's President Raul Castro, presides the International Day Against Homophobia in Havana, May 17. HAVANA â Cuba's gay community celebrated unprecedented openness â and high-ranking political alliances â with a government-backed campaign against homophobia on Saturday. The meeting at a convention center in Havana's Vedado district may have been the largest gathering of openly gay activists ever on the communist-run island. President Raul Castro's daughter Mariela, who has promoted the rights of sexual minorities, presided. \\"This is a very important moment for us, the men and women of Cuba, because for the first time we can gather in this way and speak profoundly and with scientific basis about these topics,\\" said Castro, director of Cuba's Center for Sexual Education. Mariela Castro joined government leaders and hundreds of activists at the one-day conference for the International Day Against Homophobia that featured shows, lectures, panel discussions and book presentations. A station also offered blood-tests for sexually transmitted diseases. Cuban state television gave prime-time play Friday to the U.S. film \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" which tells the story of two cowboys who conceal their homosexual affair. Prejudice against homosexuals remains deeply rooted in Cuban society, but the government has steadily moved away from the Puritanism of the 1960s and 1970s, when homosexuals hid their sexuality for fear of being ridiculed, fired from work or even imprisoned. Now Cuba's parliament is studying proposals to legalize same-sex unions and give gay couples the benefits that people in traditional marriages enjoy. Parliament head Ricardo Alarcon said the government needs to do more to promote gay rights, but said many Cubans still need to be convinced. Things \\"are advancing, but must continue advancing, and I think we should do that in a coherent, appropriate and precise way because these are topics that have been taboo and continue to be for many,\\" Alarcon told reporters. Some at the conference spoke of streaming out into the streets for a spontaneous gay-pride parade, but others urged caution. The gay rights movement should be careful not to \\"flood\\" Cuban society with a message that many are not ready to hear, physician and gay activist Alberto Roque cautioned. And Mariela Castro said gay activists should opt for more subtle ways to chip away at deep-seated homophobic attitudes. Defending equal rights for Cubans, of all sexual orientations, is a key principal of the Cuban revolution led by her uncle Fidel Castro, who overthrew dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959, she said. \\"The freedom of sexual choice and gender identity (are) exercises in equality and social justice,\\" she said. Summary:","completion":"In Cuba, there was a big event where many people who are gay came together to support each other and talk about how to make life better for gay people in their country. They had shows, lectures, and even blood tests for health checkups. This was important because, in the past, it was difficult to be openly gay in Cuba. Some people were not treated well, lost their jobs, or even went to jail. The government is now trying to change that and make things better for gay people in Cuba. They are thinking about letting gay couples get married and have the same benefits as other married couples. However, some people still don't agree with this, so they are trying to be careful and help others understand why this is important."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.

In mid-2003, during Silverchair's hiatus, the pair re-united and formed The Dissociatives, releasing a self-titled album in April 2004. The duo provided the theme music for the popular ABC-TV music quiz show Spicks and Specks - as a reworking of the Bee Gees' 1966 hit of the same name. Johns also collaborated with then-wife Natalie Imbruglia on her Counting Down the Days album, released in April 2005. Joannou worked with blues-rock group The Mess Hall; he co-produced - with Matt Lovell - their six-track extended play, Feeling Sideways, which was released in May 2003. The album was nominated for the ARIA Award for 'Best Independent Release' in 2003. Joannou and Lovell co-produced The Mess Hall's studio album, Notes from a Ceiling which was issued in June 2005. Joannou and Lovell received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for 'Producer of the Year'. In 2003, Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr, initially as a song-writing project, they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? , can you please find it? Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Harvard joins growing trend of arts education in med schools Aspiring doctors may not think they have time to gaze at paintings or play the viola while they’re cramming for anatomy tests. But Harvard Medical School thinks students should be doing more of that — and the school is not alone. This fall, Harvard launched a new initiative to use more drama, dance, and literature to help medical students become empathetic and reflective doctors. In doing so, Harvard joins a growing number of schools making more overt efforts to weave arts and humanities into medical education. The Yale School of Medicine, for instance, requires students to scrutinize paintings in a museum to improve their skills at observation and empathy — a program that has been replicated around the country, including at Harvard and Brown. At Columbia, incoming medical students are required to complete a six-week narrative medicine course. They can take classes in fiction writing, obituary writing, and visual art. At Penn State College of Medicine, the first medical school in the country to create its own humanities department, students can take a comics and medicine course to fulfill a required humanities elective. These kinds of programs are now spreading to more medical schools. “There is, on a national level, increasing support for this kind of activity,” said Dr. John Prescott, chief academic officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The arts have not been absent from Harvard’s medical campus, where students play in a popular orchestra and produce a literary magazine. But individual professors have been promoting the arts “in the dark, on their own,” said Dr. Joel Katz, a Harvard Medical School associate professor who takes students to Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts to hone their observation skills. Now, he said, the Arts and Humanities Initiative — which includes arts-themed field trips, an artist-in-residency each spring, monthly events like open mic nights, and a collaboration with Harvard’s American Repertory Theater — has coordinated existing efforts and expanded them. Efforts like these don’t aim to make doctors into artists, said Dr. Kenneth Ludmerer, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine who studies the history of medicine. They are “a tool to help doctors understand people and their conditions.” They help doctors see beyond the disease, the “narrow biological aspect,” to the illness, which includes anxiety, fear, and the whole human experience of being sick, he said. Medical schools started introducing ethics and literature into their curriculums in the 1960s, Ludmerer said. In the last decade, the movement has accelerated and broadened to include sociology, music, and most recently, art. That’s taken place partly as pushback against the growing specialization of medicine, combined with technological advances, that make doctors “cursingly narrow in their vision,” Ludmerer said. Despite the competing pressures — “standardizing care, technologizing care, quickening care, streamlining care, fragmenting care, sub-specializing care” — the medical humanities movement is gaining more institutional support from medical schools, said Dr. Rita Charon, executive director of Columbia’s Program in Narrative Medicine. She is working with several universities, including Dartmouth, McGill, and the University of Southern California, to incorporate arts and humanities into their medical programs. Research has found that physician empathy improves clinical outcomes for patients — but that empathy declines as students go through medical school and become desensitized. Museum-based observation courses do improve students’ visual diagnostic skills, studies show. But more evidence is needed to show that programs like these also improve students’ empathetic skills, said Dr. Horace DeLisser, associate dean for diversity and inclusion at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His school is piloting a museum-based training course for students and conducting a scientific study to evaluate its impact. The study includes measuring whether the course improves students’ ability to recognize the emotions in photographs of actors’ eyes. Besides building empathetic skills, Harvard’s arts program aims to help students process the human tragedies they’re exposed to in medical school, said Dr. Lisa Wong, a pediatrician and musician who is helping to lead the initiative. “Medical school is so intense,” she said. “There’s a lot you have to suppress in yourself.” The more students learn to express their feelings through the arts, she said, “the less traumatized you will be.” Harvard’s program is starting on a small scale, with some seed money from the dean’s office and outside donors, and optional events instead of required course work. The Arts and Humanities Initiative’s first event of the year, on a rainy Wednesday night in September, drew just a handful of medical students. The occasion was a dramatic reading of Margaret Edson’s play “Wit,” about an English professor’s experience undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic ovarian cancer. Organizers put on the play to generate reflection and discussion about how hospitals treat — and mistreat — patients with their words and attitudes. Two medical students performed alongside drama students from Harvard. In a post-play discussion, Ivana Viani, a third-year medical student who performed in “Wit” two years ago, said the experience stuck with her as she moved into a hospital setting. One day on a clinical rotation, she said, she found herself standing by a patient’s bedside, presenting his case to a medical team. Radiological evidence had just shown the patient was very likely to have cancer, but Viani didn’t want to say the “c” word until there was a biopsy because the play showed her how powerful that word can be. “The attending [doctor] just interrupted me and said, ‘You have cancer.’ And we just left,” she recalled. After finishing her rounds, she went back to ask how he was doing. He started to cry. He asked her how long he had to live. She talked through the diagnosis and told him, “We’re going to go through this together.” Embodying someone else’s experience through theater helped Viani acknowledge what the patient was going through, she said. “You have a way to be there for a patient, in a way that you wouldn’t have been there before.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Harvard Medical School launched an initiative to incorporate arts education into medical training with the aim of fostering empathy and reflection in medical students. 2. Other medical schools, including Yale, Columbia, and Penn State, have also introduced similar programs involving arts and humanities, aiming to help doctors understand the human aspects of patients' conditions beyond the biological aspect. 3. The integration of arts and humanities into medical curriculums has gained more institutional support and has shown positive results in improving students' observational skills, though more evidence is needed to confirm the impact on their empathetic skills. 4. Physician empathy has been linked with better clinical outcomes for patients, but the level of empathy declines as students progress through medical school. 5. Harvard's arts program also aims to help medical students process the emotional challenges they face during their medical education, potentially reducing the level of trauma experienced."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838-1919) and David Richardson (1835-1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather manufacturing business. At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham School in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. Richardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict--an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation's armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations. He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \\"There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.\\" In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, there are many more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones that kill many. While no conflict's size can be predicted beforehand--indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the series--overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores).

So, let's get rid of the '+ 1275' by subtracting 1275 from both sides: -164*w = -3481 - 1275 Calculating the right side: -3481 - 1275 = -4756 Now, our equation is: -164*w = -4756 Finally, to find 'w', we need to divide both sides by -164: w = -4756 / -164 And if we do the division, we get: w = 29 So, the answer for 'w' is 29!

The red chalk is in the shade while the blue chalk is in the sun. Since sunlight imparts heat to objects it shines upon, the blue chalk, being in the sun, will absorb more thermal energy compared to the red chalk, which is in the shade.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - Bari (Bari dialect: Bare; \\"Bárion\\") is the capital city of the Metropolitan City of Bari and of the Apulia region, on the Adriatic Sea, in Italy. It is the second most important economic centre of mainland Southern Italy after Naples, and is well known as a port and university city, as well as the city of Saint Nicholas. The city itself has a population of about 326,799, , over , while the urban area counts 653,028 inhabitants over . The metropolitan area counts 1.3 million inhabitants. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Lupus Protospatharius Barensis was the reputed author of the Chronicon rerum in regno Neapolitano gestarum ( also called Annales Lupi Protospatharii ) , a precise history of the Mezzogiorno from 805 to 1102 . He has only been named as the author since the seventeenth century . Lupus , along with two other Bariot chronicles , the Annales barenses and the Anonymi barensis chronicon , used some lost ancient annals of Bari up to 1051 . William of Apulia appears to have used these same annals . Lupus also used the lost annals of Matera . Perhaps most unusual to Lupus is his dating method . He began his years in September and so places events of the latter half of a given year in the next year . - The Normans (Norman: \\"Nourmands\\"; ) were the people who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, gave their name to Normandy, a region in France. They were descended from Norse (\\"Norman\\" comes from \\"Norseman\\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Gallo-Roman populations, their descendants would gradually adopt the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia, ultimately resulting in their own assimilation into the Romance society. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries. - William of Apulia was a chronicler of the Normans, writing in the 1090s. His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (10591085). - Basilicata (or ), also known as Lucania, is a region in the south of Italy, bordering on Campania to the west, Apulia (\\"Puglia\\") to the north and east, and Calabria to the south. It also has two coastlines, one on the Tyrrhenian Sea between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the Gulf of Taranto between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \\"instep\\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \\"toe\\" and Apulia the \\"heel\\". The region covers about and in 2010 had a population slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is Potenza. The region is divided into two provinces: Potenza and Matera. The president of Basilicata is Marcello Pittella. - Matera (or locally ) is a city and a province in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. It is the capital of the province of Matera and the capital of Basilicata from 1663 to 1806. The town lies in a small canyon carved out by the Gravina. - Robert Guiscard ( 17 July 1085) was a Norman adventurer remembered for the conquest of southern Italy and Sicily. Robert was born into the Hauteville family in Normandy, went on to become Count of Apulia and Calabria (10571059), and then Duke of Apulia and Calabria and Duke of Sicily (10591085). - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270 6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang. Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title Tängri Qaghan by the Tang Emperor Taizong in addition to his title as emperor was eastern Asia's first \\"simultaneous kingship\\".Many notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the Emperor Wuzong of Tang enacted policies to persecute Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence. Although the dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the 9th century, art and culture continued to flourish. The weakened central government largely withdrew from managing the economy, but the country's mercantile affairs stayed intact and commercial trade continued to thrive regardless. However, agrarian rebellions in the latter half of the 9th century resulted in damaging atrocities such as the Guangzhou massacre of 878–879. answer the following question: Under what dynasty did the regional military governors gain power?

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them. Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited. People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people. Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings. Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Dr. Beecham for the following movie plot: A group of scientists with Operation Deep Freeze discover frozen prehistoric trees and other specimens in the Antarctic dating back to the first Ice Age. They collect samples of each for further study and load them aboard their C-47 military transport. The dull, workaday life at the Navy weather station base on Gow Island in the South Pacific is interrupted by that very same C-47 transport aircraft. On a routine approach for refueling, the transport experiences unusual trouble and suddenly crash lands on the island's single airstrip, destroying its control tower and the island's only two-way radio. The stricken aircraft also blocks the runway, preventing its further use. Lieutenant Charles Brown (Eisley) is in command of Gow's weather station. He, Navy nurse Nora Hall (Van Doren), and biologist Arthur Beecham (Walter Sande) reach the wreck only to find that seven scientists and crew aboard the cargo aircraft when it left Antarctica are now mysteriously missing. The only one found aboard is the transport's pilot, who is traumatized and in a state of shock, unable to speak. Unloading the prehistoric cargo from the crashed C-47, Dr. Beecham recommends planting the trees to ensure their survival in the island's tropical conditions. Somewhat later, Gow Island's bird population becomes disturbed by something unknown. At the same time, the weather station's scientists try to figure out a connection between this event and a corrosive residue that begins turning up at various island locations. It slowly becomes clear that the planted prehistoric trees have quickly grown into acid-secreting, carnivorous monsters that move about Gow Island at night, at will. They reproduce fast and eventually cut off the island with their growing numbers and nocturnal assaults on Gow's native islanders. Brown has to hold together his dwindling Navy personnel and the coterie of scientists and civilians while figuing out a way to stop this prehistoric menace. The Navy personnel's only available weapons prove largely ineffective against...

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If a person sweats less than usual or has reduced sweating, it will affect their body's ability to cool down efficiently. This could cause the person to become overheated more easily since the evaporation of sweat plays a crucial role in dissipating heat from the body's surface. In this case, the reduced moisture release and evaporation would decrease the cooling effect on the body, which could potentially lead to overheating, discomfort, and possible heat-related illnesses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On March 1, 2017, it was announced that the Gaither Vocal Band lineup consisted of Reggie Smith, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles, and Bill Gaither, as of April 1. Although the group started out recording contemporary Christian music in the 1980s, it became known for southern gospel after the popularity of the Gaither Homecoming videos. The lineup of the band changes often, with artists leaving to work on solo careers, and new and old ones coming to replace them. Michael English was hired as the new lead singer, so McSpadden was moved down to baritone, and Gaither dropped to the lowest part. At this point the group dropped the \\"new\\" part of their name. Although the previous album (New Point of View) had been more contemporary than its predecessors, the album with this version of the group (One X 1) took it even further. After this album, Larnelle left and was replaced by Lemuel Miller. The group did not record an album with Lemuel before he too left. He was replaced by Imperials alumnus, Jim Murray. This line up cut one album (Wings) before Gary McSpadden left to start his solo career. Mark Lowry was convinced to replace him. Along with a great voice, Lowry added comedy to the mix. Their Gospel roots project Homecoming in 1991 caused most Southern Gospel fans to welcome the Vocal Band with open arms. Jim Murray left and was replaced by Terry Franklin. The album Southern Classics was released in 1993 with the hit \\"I Bowed On My Knees\\". Later Michael English left. He was replaced by Buddy Mullins. Mullins was only a temporary fill-in, but he was included on the album Testify. Terry Franklin soon left and was replaced by yet another Imperials alumnus, Jonathan Pierce (formerly known as Jonathan Hildreth, his first and last name--then changed to his first and middle name). Strengthened by the popularity of the Homecoming video series, the Vocal Band added Guy Penrod at lead. After Pierce's departure, Gaither hired David Phelps at tenor. After Lowry's departure, Imperials alumnus Russ Taff sang baritone for a couple of years. Marshall Hall was his replacement. Wes Hampton succeeded Phelps in 2005. The group has had three number one songs on the Singing News chart. \\"Yes, I Know\\" held the top position from July to October 1997, as did \\"I Will Go On\\" in November 2006. \\"Greatly Blessed\\" was their third number one single.

Premise: \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor. \\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could\\" is true, it suggests that the individual was solely focused on leaving the current space and entering the corridor as fast as possible. The situation implies a sense of urgency, where the person did not have the luxury of time to contemplate or think about various matters. There might be external factors or conditions that trigger this determination to move quickly. It could be due to fear, danger, anxiety, or a pressing matter that demands expeditious attention. However, the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor\\" suggests a different scenario. It implies that the individual had the time and the mental capacity to consider multiple subjects, factors, or concerns before taking action. This situation indicates that the individual was not dealing with the same sense of urgency as in the premise. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis reveals a notable contradiction. The premise highlights the urgency of the individual's thoughts and actions, focusing on escaping the area and entering the corridor as quickly as possible. In contrast, the hypothesis involves a more relaxed and contemplative state of mind, where the individual takes the time to mull over various topics before deciding to walk out into the corridor. Given this dissonance between the two statements, it can be reasonably concluded that if the premise is true, it does not entail the hypothesis. The idea of having only one thought centered on swiftly moving to the corridor directly negates the hypothesis that the individual had the time, mental capacity or inclination to think about multiple aspects before walking out into the corridor. In summary, if the premise \\"My only thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could\\" is indeed accurate, it contradicts and therefore does not entail the hypothesis \\"I thought about many things before walking out into the corridor.\\" The two situations portrayed are fundamentally incompatible, as one involves a single-minded focus with a sense of urgency, while the other revolves around a more deliberate, reflective state of mind that considers a range of subjects or concerns before taking action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. Draw them by making two or three large, rod-shaped ovals in the cell but outside the nucleus. Each mitochondrion (singular) should contain an enclosed shape with many ridges and switchback lines. This shape represents the mitochondrial cristae or inner folds of the organelle's membrane that provide more surface area to carry out processes. Leave a gap between the oval of the outer membrane and the inner membrane. Starting at one edge of the nuclear membrane, draw a large shape that extends out of the membrane with several finger-like shapes pointing to each side before reconnecting to the nucleus. This entire shape is the endoplasmic reticulum. The shape should be fairly large because the endoplasmic reticulum can take up as much as 10% of the volume of the entire cell. Animal cells have both a smooth and a rough endoplasmic reticulum. To make the rough endoplasmic reticulum, place dots on the outside edge of the finger-like shapes on one side of the endoplasmic reticulum. These dots represent ribosomes. To make the Golgi body (or Golgi apparatus), draw a set of three dumbbell-type shapes that are cylindrical at the center and bulbous at the ends. Each dumbbell should successively increase in size as they get farther from the nucleus and closer to the cell membrane. The Golgi body packages and sends complex molecules around and out of the cell. It does this via vesicles that you can represent around the Golgi body with a few small circles. Capitalize Golgi since it is the name of the discovering biologist. Centrioles help assist with cell division. They are close to but separate from the nucleus. Form the centrioles by drawing two small rectangles perpendicular to each other near the nucleus. The centrioles are paired organelles, which is why you draw two of the rectangles together. The lysosome is like the scrapyard of the cell that breaks down unneeded material to reuse. Represent the lysosome with a small circle at the edge of the cell. Add many small dots in the lysosome to show the digestive enzymes inside, which is called a hydrolytic enzyme mixture. You can place the lysosome near the Golgi apparatus since the organelles are often budded from the Golgi body. Ribosomes also float around in the cytosol, which is the cellular fluid inside the membrane but outside of all the organelles. Show the extra ribosomes in the cytosol by making several more dots inside the cell. If you have color-coordinated your drawing, make the ribosomes in the cell, attached to the nuclear membrane, and attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum all the same color. Cytosol and cytoplasm are often used interchangeably for the fluid in the cell. Though the fluid in the nucleus is nucleoplasm.","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide to drawing various organelles within an animal cell, including details on illustrating mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi body, centrioles, lysosomes, and ribosomes, while explaining their functions and interrelationships within the cellular structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Not much negative to say about the club itself besides the fact that it was SUPER Packed, but hey, its supposed to be one of the most poppin clubs in vegas so I can't complain about this too much. Here's the deal with Kalani. I had reserved a table with 3 bottles for me and my buddies through a promoter. He passed on my info to Kalani and I got a text the day before confirming the table and our price minimum. I responded quickly to confirm and he says make sure were there by 10:30 and to call him when we arrive. So far so good. Anyways, we get there early, around 10. I call him and communication is pretty horrible, not his fault, it was loud and there was already a long line. He says come to the front of the general admission line. I look for him for a while and after some confusion we finally meet up. He tells another host to take care of my group so we go through and pass the entire line and get let into the club. So far so good. Now, were in front of the cashier and my friends are just waiting for me since I'm organizing all of this. Keep in mind, this is my first time trying to get a table in vegas. So one of my buddies asks if I got a receipt slip from Kalani, i didn't, so i go back out and ask kalani what were supposed to do. He finishes helping the dude before us and starts writing on the receipt slip and communicating with his ear piece. He repeats my name into his mic and proceeds to say \\"His name is Sennett, s-e-n-n-e-t-t, he's in the system\\". And a minute later, he looks over and says, sorry man they don't have your table. I look at him with a perplexed look and say, \\"what?, what are you talking about\\". ANYWAYS... He proceeds to tell me and my group to pay the cover to get in, and that a table should open up in an hour and that he would reimburse our cover and give us our originally agreed upon table minimum. He says he will stay in contact with me via text. At that point, I realized that we had just gotten fucked over and that we weren't getting a table. I felt bad and responsible for me and my friends not getting a table. We paid the cover and got in and of course did not hear anything back from Kalani.

The long paragraph detailing the issues with Kalani in securing a table is mostly negative sentiment, as it describes a frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful experience. 6. \\"Ended up still having a pretty good time but that started our night off at XS in a sour manner...\\" - Mixed sentiment, as the author mentions having a good time despite the negative experience. Conclusion: The overall sentiment of this review is mixed but leans towards negative, primarily due to the author's experiences with VIP host Kalani. However, there is some positive sentiment about the club itself, its amenities, and the fact that they still had a good time in the end.

A better, more detailed answer would be: The Never Ending Story, a West German-produced English-language film, was released in 1984. The film, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is based on the fantasy novel of the same name written by Michael Ende. The movie, featuring a blend of live-action and animation, tells the story of a young boy named Bastian who becomes immersed in the fantastical world of a book he discovers. As he reads, he is drawn into the struggle between the forces of good and evil in the magical land of Fantasia, which is threatened by a malevolent force called The Nothing. The Never Ending Story achieved commercial success at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics. Moreover, the soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger, including the iconic theme song by Limahl, added to the film's popularity.

Write an article based on this \\"Factory workers found in an anti-slavery raid in Greater Manchester \\"clung\\" to officers and begged to be rescued, police said.\\"","completion":"Title: Factory Workers Found in Anti-Slavery Raid: A Glimpse into Modern Slave Labor in Greater Manchester Introduction In a recent raid in Greater Manchester, police officers were shocked to find factory workers clinging to them and begging to be rescued from deplorable working conditions, highlighting the persisting issue of modern slavery in the workforce. Despite increased efforts to combat human trafficking and forced labor worldwide, incidents such as this one reveal the harsh reality faced by countless individuals. This article examines this recent raid and its broader implications, delving into the hidden world of modern slave labor in Greater Manchester and beyond. The Raid Acting on a tip-off, Greater Manchester Police led an operation targeting a local factory suspected of housing slave labor. The police found numerous workers toiling in cramped and unsanitary conditions, with limited access to basic necessities such as food and water. Chillingly, some of these workers were so desperate for rescue that they \\"clung\\" to officers, pleading for help as they were removed from the environment. The police have since arrested several individuals, with authorities gathering evidence and resources to protect the victims and ensure that justice is served. This case has illuminated the need for continued vigilance and action against modern slavery, not just in Greater Manchester, but in workplaces across the country. Modern Slavery in Greater Manchester While the anti-slavery raid is a significant achievement in the ongoing fight against human trafficking and forced labor, it exposes a grave reality in Greater Manchester. Regrettably, these victims are not alone in their suffering — modern slavery is a widespread issue that affects countless vulnerable individuals within the local community. According to the Global Slavery Index, over 40 million people worldwide are subjected to modern slavery, including forced labor and human trafficking. Many of these victims are working in the shadows of society, too afraid or unable to seek help. Tragically, exploitation and slave labor persist in various sectors, such as agriculture, construction, hospitality, and domestic work. Factors Contributing to Modern Slavery Several key factors contribute to the prevalence of modern slavery, even in developed economies like the UK. A lack of awareness and information on the topic exacerbates the issue, as many victims are unable or unwilling to seek help due to fear, shame, or ignorance. Moreover, loose regulations and enforcement in high-risk industries provide fertile ground for exploitation. Perpetrators often prey on vulnerable populations, such as migrants and refugees, who may be fleeing war, persecution, or poverty. These individuals can be more susceptible to exploitation due to factors like language barriers, limited access to legal employment opportunities, and a need for income to support themselves and their families. Recognizing and Combating Modern Slavery Recognizing the signs of modern slavery is crucial for everyone, from law enforcement officials to ordinary citizens. Indicators can include signs of physical or emotional abuse, a lack of personal belongings, restricted social interactions, and long or unreasonable working hours. As awareness of the issue grows, efforts to combat modern slavery and protect its victims must continue. The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 was a crucial step forward, but ongoing collaboration between the government, law enforcement agencies, businesses, and NGOs is necessary to make a meaningful impact. Regularly reviewing and reporting on labor exploitation, providing resources and support to victims, and ensuring accountability for companies are all vital components that strengthen the fight against modern slavery. Moreover, educating the public through awareness campaigns and fostering a culture of vigilance and empathy will help bring slave labor out of the shadows and into the light. Conclusion As the Greater Manchester raid illustrates, modern slavery remains a dire issue that requires continued attention and action. By recognizing its existence, understanding its contributing factors, and implementing the appropriate measures to combat it, we can work towards a future that safeguards the rights of all workers, regardless of their background or circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too.

The 'Pilgrim's Way' runs in an easterly direction from Winchester in Hampshire, to which city?","completion":"The 'Pilgrim's Way' is an ancient track that runs in an easterly direction from Winchester in Hampshire to the city of Canterbury in Kent. The route stretches for approximately 153 miles (246 km) and has been followed by countless travelers, including pilgrims, for centuries. Canterbury, the final destination of the Pilgrim's Way, is a historic English cathedral city located in the southeast part of the country. It is known for its world-famous Canterbury Cathedral, which is the seat of the spiritual head of the Church of England. The city has a rich religious history, drawing pilgrims from near and far to visit its magnificent cathedral, as well as the other historic sites it hosts. Canterbury's cultural and historic significance further grew after the famous murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in the cathedral in 1170. In response to this event, Christians from across the region began to visit his shrine, leading to the creation of the 'Pilgrim's Way.' The journey, later immortalized in Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century literary masterpiece, \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" became a significant aspect of medieval life in England, bringing together people from all social classes to share their experiences and tell their stories. The 'Pilgrim's Way' traverses through picturesque landscapes, idyllic villages, and historic sites. The route typically starts at Winchester Cathedral, passes through towns and villages such as New Alresford, Farnham, Guildford, and Westerham, skirts London, and crosses the River Medway before entering the lush countryside of Kent. Throughout the journey, travelers can explore ancient churches, medieval castles, and heritage sites, all while enjoying the natural beauty that England has to offer. Upon reaching Canterbury, pilgrims can relive the history by visiting the famous Canterbury Cathedral, where the shrine of Archbishop Thomas Becket is found. Other historical landmarks in the city include St. Augustine's Abbey, St. Martin's Church (the oldest church in England), and the Canterbury Heritage Museum. Today, modern-day pilgrims and outdoor enthusiasts can still follow the 'Pilgrim's Way' by walking, cycling, or horseback riding along the ancient trail. They can experience the rich history, fascinating stories, and stunning landscapes associated with the journey, all while reflecting on what it might have been like for medieval travelers walking the same path hundreds of years ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a while he stopped doing it. Tom noticed his slippers smelled really bad. He got a new pair and his dog fetched them again. Can we draw the following conclusion? tom owns at least one pair of slippers","completion":"Based on the provided information, we can analyze Tom's behavior with his dog and his slippers in detail to draw conclusions. Initially, Tom's dog was trained to fetch his slippers for him, and the dog did this every single time. This implies that Tom did own a pair of slippers, which his dog fetched for him consistently. However, after some time, the dog stopped fetching the slippers, and Tom realized that his slippers smelled bad. It is evident that those bad-smelling slippers were the ones Tom owned, and so he had at least one pair of slippers causing that issue. The fact that Tom identified the problem and procured new slippers confirms that he understood the significance of having a clean pair of slippers to prompt his dog to continue fetching them. Once Tom got a new pair of slippers, the dog resumed fetching them for him again. This exchange indicates that Tom acknowledged the issue and made the effort to rectify it. At this point, Tom owns another pair of slippers, which replaced the old smelly ones. Taking these factors into consideration, we can draw the conclusion that Tom owns at least one pair of slippers.

Not long after this an event occurred which produced great excitement in the new settlement; namely, the appearance of natives in the woods. It occurred under the following circumstances. One morning Karlsefin gave orders for one of the exploring parties to be got ready to go out immediately. Karlsefin's plan from the beginning had been to class his men in two divisions. One half stayed at home to work, the other half searched the land,--always taking care, however, not to travel so far but that they could return home in the evening. They were careful also not to wander far from each other. Sometimes Karlsefin went with the exploring party, at other times stayed at home to superintend the work there, while Biarne or Thorward filled his place. On the occasion in question Biarne was in charge. Soon after the party had started, Hake, who was one of them, observed a female figure disappear round a copse near the shores of the lake. At that part they were about to strike off into the thick woods, so Hake went up to Biarne and asked leave to go along by the borders of the lake, saying that he could overtake the party again before they had reached the Willow Glen, a well-known rendezvous of the hunters and explorers of the colony. \\"Go as thou wilt, Hake,\\" replied Biarne; \\"only see to it that ye overtake us before noon, as I intend to go on a totally new path to-day.\\" 1.

UPDATED:. 17:48 EST, 5 September 2012. Fall from grace: A federal probe found former Harvard psychology professor Marc Hauser to be responsible for six cases of research misconduct. Federal investigators have found that a Harvard University psychology professor who resigned after being accused of scientific transgression fabricated data and manipulated results in experiments. The findings detailing Marc Hauser's transgressions were contained in a report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity (ORI) released Wednesday online. Hauser, 52, left Harvard last summer, ten months after a faculty investigation found him ‘solely responsible’ for eight instances of scientific misconduct at the prestigious Ivy League school, the Boston Globe reported. The federal document found six cases in which Hauser engaged in research misconduct in work supported by four National Institutes of Health grants. One paper was retracted and two were corrected. Other problems were found in unpublished work. Hauser released a statement Wednesday, saying that although he has fundamental differences with the findings, he acknowledges that he made mistakes. ‘I let important details get away from my control, and as head of the lab, I take responsibility for all errors made within the lab, whether or not I was directly involved,’ he stated. ‘I am saddened that this investigation has caused some to question all of my work, rather than the few papers and unpublished studies in question. ‘I remain proud of the many important papers generated by myself, my collaborators and my students over the years. I am also deeply gratified to see my students carve out significant areas of research at major universities around the world,’ Hauser said. Internal probe: A three-year investigation at Harvard found in 2010 that Hauser had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct. In one instance, investigators determined that Hauser fabricated half the data in a bar graph in a research paper on cotton-top tamarind monkeys’ ability to learn syllables that was published in 2002 in the journal Cognition. According to the findings of the probe, the 52-year-old professor ‘falsified the coding’ of some monkeys’ responses to sound stimuli in two unpublished papers to ensure that a particular finding does not appear random, and ‘falsely reported the results and methodology’ for one of seven experiments in a paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2007. A paper examining monkeys’ abilities to learn grammatical patterns included false descriptions of how the monkeys’ behavior was coded, ‘leading to a false proportion or number of animals showing a favorable response,’ the report stated. The document, which will be published in the Federal Register Thursday, comes on the heels of a three-year internal investigation at Harvard that found in 2010 that the popular professor had committed eight instances of scientific misconduct. According to the report, Hauser ‘neither admits nor denies committing research misconduct but accepts ORI has found evidence of research misconduct.’ As part of a voluntary settlement, the former professor has accepted several professional restrictions for the next three years. New job: Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative. Hauser has agreed to have any research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service supervised, to exclude himself from serving as an adviser to the PHS, and to have his employer guarantee the accuracy of his data and methodology before applying for federal funding. According to his LinkedIn profile, Hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the Alternative Education Program at Cape Cod Collaborative. Houser, a published author of popular books favored by the media, gained wide recognition for his research into the evolutionary roots of human abilities, including language, and whether morality was inborn or learned. Less than a week ago, Hauser's former Ivy League employer made national headlines after it has been revealed that 125 students at the prestigious institution are being investigated for allegedly cheating on a take-home exam.","completion":"So, imagine if you're playing a game and you cheat to win, but then get caught, you'd be in a lot of trouble, right?

But then people found out he was cheating in his research - that's like the homework he does as a teacher. They discovered he made up some of his results instead of finding them out the right way. He was found to have cheated six times on a big project funded by the National Institutes of Health. Because of all this, he had to leave his job at Harvard. Now, he's helping young people who are having a tough time with their lives, which is very different to what he used to do.

Ethem Orhon, 67, is accused of attacking the women in a Sainsbury's car park in Hampton, London, on 20 May, Kingston Crown Court heard he had been arrested for possession of a knife on 19 May and was bailed two hours before the alleged assaults. Mr Orhon, of Hampton, denies two counts of attempted murder. He has also pleaded not guilty to two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The prosecution says Suzanna Brand, 53, Janet Morsy, 63, Jean Sullivan, 68, and Charandasi Chandiramani, 71, were entirely innocent and selected at random in the car park in south-west London. The court heard they had suffered appalling injuries after Mr Orhon attacked them with a Leatherman knife, which was shown to the jury. Ms Brand was stabbed 12 times, including in her back and side that led to two collapsed lungs and laceration to her liver. Ms Morsy was heard pleading \\"please don't\\" shortly before Mr Orhon stabbed her three times. She lost a litre of blood in the attack. The jury heard that Mr Orhon did not say a word during the attacks, but was eventually stopped by police officers who had to draw their Tasers before he surrendered. The prosecution said Mr Orhon felt he had been mistreated by the police and that this was his motive for the attacks. It said the trial would hear of the \\"true bravery\\" of members of the public who tried to help, including two school children who may have prevented further attacks by distracting him and calling the police.

Available options: a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;...I think the answer is","completion":"c). no. It is not possible to conclude that \\"A young lady with a pink shirt and white hat is standing on her horse with her hand over her heart\\" if \\"The man is riding his scooter next to the park\\" for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the two scenarios presented in these statements are completely unrelated. The first statement describes a young lady and her actions while riding a horse, while the second statement describes a man riding a scooter next to a park. There is no connection or common ground between these two situations that would allow us to draw any conclusions about the young lady based on the information about the man. In addition to the lack of connection between the two situations, the statements themselves do not provide any overlapping or shared information. The first statement gives details about the young lady's attire and how she is positioned on her horse, while the second statement provides information about the man's mode of transportation and his location. There is no shared context, such as both subjects being in the same location or involved in the same activity, that could possibly link these statements and permit any conclusions to be drawn. Even if we consider additional possibilities or interpretations for these statements, it remains impossible to establish any conclusions about the young lady based on the information given about the man. For example, we might speculate that the man and young lady know each other, or that they are both participants in a parade or event. However, even in these alternative scenarios, we still lack sufficient information to definitively conclude anything about the young lady and her actions based on the man's actions. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the two statements, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the young lady with the pink shirt and white hat standing on her horse with her hand over her heart from the statement about the man riding his scooter next to the park.

Exploration occurs in all non-sessile animal species, including humans. In human history, its most dramatic rise was during the Age of Discovery when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, major explorations after the Age of Discovery have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron. - Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology. While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human spaceflight. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a crew or passengers aboard the spacecraft. Spacecraft carrying people may be operated directly, by human crew, or it may be either remotely operated from ground stations on Earth or be autonomous, able to carry out a specific mission with no human involvement. - The International Astronomical Union (IAU UAI) is an international association of professional astronomers, at the PhD level and beyond, active in professional research and education in astronomy. Among other activities, it acts as the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies (stars, planets, asteroids, etc.) and any surface features on them. - Stamatios ( Tom ) M. Krimigis ( Greek : ) is a Greek - American scientist in space exploration . He has contributed to many of the United States ' unmanned space exploration programs of the Solar System and beyond . He has contributed to exploration missions to almost every planet of the Solar System . In 1999 , the International Astronomical Union named the asteroid 8323 Krimigis ( previously 1979 UH ) in his honor . - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - An astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of Earth. They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy.

Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean. After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline. Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air. Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous. Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami. At the same time, Coast Guard personnel from the Venturous investigate the wrecked schooner.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.

But stop biting your finger-nails. Public speaking is easy. It's just plain talking, and you talk all the time. Public speaking is not a \\"gift\\" like musical talent or being able to draw. Anybody who can talk can speak in public. Here are some tips: Keep it simple. Your audience is going to learn one or two from your main ideas by heart. If you can't express, then your speech is not focused well enough. And if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to say, then your audience will have no interest in your speech. Get organized. No matter how long or short your speech is, you'd better get your materials in order: how you're going to start, what major points you want to make and how you're going to close. You may often write the last sentence first. When you know what your aim is, you can choose any ways to get there. A strong close is powerful. The last thing you say is what your audience will most likely remember. Keep it short. The standard length of a vaudeville act was 12 minutes.

Unexpectedly, he falls and breaks his leg, leaving him dependent on a crutch. Brick, along with his wife, Maggie \\"the Cat\\" (Elizabeth Taylor), are seen the next day visiting his family's estate in eastern Mississippi, there to celebrate Big Daddy's (Burl Ives) 65th birthday. Depressed, Brick decides to spend his days drinking while resisting the affections of his wife, who taunts him about the inheritance of Big Daddy's wealth. Numerous allusions are made to their tempestuous marriage â there are speculations as to why Maggie does not yet have children while Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood) have a whole clan, many of whom run around the \\"plantation\\" (as Big Daddy's estate is called) unsupervised and singing obnoxiously. Big Daddy and Big Mama (Judith Anderson) arrive home from the hospital via their private airplane and are greeted by Gooper and his wife, along with Maggie. Despite the efforts of Mae, Gooper and their kids to draw his attention to them, Big Daddy has eyes only for Maggie. The news is that Big Daddy is not dying from cancer. However, the doctor later meets privately with first Gooper and then Brick where he divulges that it is a deception. Big Daddy has inoperable cancer and will likely be dead within a year, and the truth is being kept from him. Brick later confides in Maggie with the truth about Big Daddy's health, and she is very heartbroken. Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his fatherâs wealth as well as health, but Brick stubbornly refuses.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the province in whose southern areas are found the only extensive agriculture? Answer the above question based on the context below: The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

There's poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel's transformation is truly touching. 4. Toni Collette gives an incredible performance - plus, there's a great use of Abba music. 5. Toni Collette gives a wonderful performance. 6. It stars the somewhat homely Toni Collette as Muriel, whose whole purpose in life is to get married. How she does that and what happens after that are a couple of the many delightful surprises in this film. 7. Ultimately, the comedy here is grounded in self-hatred, hostility, and despair. 8. So overrated. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' for the nineties. 9. There are some funny and inventive sequences here, but for the most part Muriel's Wedding is disappointingly simplistic and cliched. 10. The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"Analyzing these reviews, it seems that the overall consensus about the movie is mostly positive.

The second review praises the writer-director for unexpected twists, indicating that the story is unique and unpredictable. It also mentions an 'uplifting conclusion' which implies a positive feel. 3. The third review describes the film as brash and sometimes overstated, but also finds poignant drama and a touching transformation — suggesting these as good qualities. 4. Reviews four and five both specifically praise Toni Collette's performance, indicating that the acting is good. 5. The sixth review also speaks well of Collette's performance and hints at delightful surprises in the film, which is another positive aspect. 6. The seventh review mentions that the comedy is grounded in negative emotions, which depending upon the viewer's taste, could be seen as either negative or positive. 7. The eighth and ninth reviews are more negative, considering the movie overrated and cliched. 8. The tenth approval states that the film's good heart keeps it from making fun of one of its characters; this could be seen as a sign of good humor and empathy in the film. Out of 10 reviews, two are clearly negative, one is mixed, and the remaining seven are positive to varying degrees.

The Czech star's straight-sets win of 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 showcased his exceptional ability and propelled him towards a semifinal meeting with either Andy Murray or Nick Kyrgios. Berdych's victory over Nadal was nothing short of stunning, as he exhibited an aggressive, focused, and relentless style of play that dismantled the Spaniard on the Rod Laver Arena. The Czech tennis ace's tactical game plan was spot-on, as he applied constant pressure on Nadal, exploiting every opportunity presented to him. The first set began with both players holding their respective serves. However, Berdych quickly gained momentum and went on a rampage against a visibly flustered Nadal. The strong baseline strokes and precise service game that the Spaniard was known for seemed to vanish under the pressure applied by Berdych. As a result, Berdych took the first set 6-2, putting Nadal on the defensive. The second set saw Berdych continuing his domineering display, as the world No.7 broke Nadal's serve repeatedly. Surprisingly, he secured the set 6-0, a scoreline that few had ever seen against the Spaniard. This \\"bagel\\" only heightened the sense of shock piercing through the crowd. With his back against the wall, Nadal fought back in the third set, as he sought to turn the tide in his favor and prevent a humiliating defeat. The set was a more closely contested affair, with both players engaging in thrilling rallies showcasing their athleticism and skill. However, as the set progressed to a tiebreak, it became apparent that Berdych was the stronger competitor. He emerged victorious in the tiebreak, clinching it 7-5, and securing his place in the semifinals. Berdych's win over Nadal was a remarkable display of determination, perseverance, and confidence, as he overcame his previous 17-match losing streak against the world No.2 that had lasted since 2007. The victory demonstrated the relentless spirit of the Czech star, highlighting his desire and tenacity to challenge the world's very best tennis players. Awaiting Berdych in the semifinals will be either Andy Murray or Nick Kyrgios. Both potential matchups have their unique challenges and opportunities for the Czech player. Murray, a former world No.1, brings vast experience and multiple Grand Slam titles to the competition, while the young Australian Nick Kyrgios showcases raw talent and a passionate home crowd backing him. Regardless of his opponent in the semis, Berdych has shown that he has the ability to defeat the best. Riding high on the momentum from his unprecedented victory, the Czech star will enter the semifinal stage with a renewed sense of belief and the goal of securing his first Australian Open title. While there are still obstacles to overcome, his performance against Nadal may go down in history as the turning point that propelled him to the pinnacle of tennis greatness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: what is the most densely populated western european country?","completion":"The most densely populated Western European country is the Netherlands (also referred to as Holland). It is located in Northwestern Europe and is bordered by countries such as Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest. Its total land area is 41,865 square kilometers, making it one of the smaller countries in Europe (ranked 131st worldwide regarding the land area). Despite its relatively small size, the Netherlands has a population of approximately 17.5 million people (as of 2021), leading to a population density of around 525 people per square kilometer. The Dutch population has continuously grown since the mid-20th century, with factors such as a general increase in life expectancy and a positive migration balance contributing to the population growth. Additionally, the Netherlands remains an attractive destination for immigrants due to its stable economy, high living standards, and favorable social services. The urbanization trend and the country's strong economy, particularly in the Randstad region, have played a large role in the high population density. The Randstad is a megalopolis that includes the country's four largest cities – Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht – and is the primary economic and population center of the Netherlands. It is home to approximately 7 million people, which accounts for almost 40% of the Dutch population. To cope with the high population density and maintain livability, the Netherlands has developed efficient land use and infrastructure policies. The Dutch have constructed well-planned cities with mixed-use neighborhoods that support walking, biking, and the efficient use of public transportation. They have also implemented policies to preserve the natural environment and encourage sustainable practices in agriculture, industry, and urban planning. The Netherlands' dense population has not hindered the country's ability to maintain a high standard of living, a strong economy, and a successful welfare state. Though the country faces challenges related to housing prices, urban congestion, and inequality, the Netherlands remains one of the most prosperous, sustainable, and innovative nations in Western Europe and the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The easiest breathing exercise is to simply inhale, hold your breath, and exhale for longer counts. First, increase your count to 5, then 6, and eventually work your way up to 10. Do 3 or 4 sets of inhales, holds, and exhales for each count. Make sure to maintain the proper breathing techniques by filling your belly and keeping your shoulders down for this and any other exercise. Inhaling for a shorter count and exhaling for longer is great exercise for your diaphragm. Start by doing a few sets of 6 count inhales and 8 count exhales. Proceed to counting to 5 as you inhale and to 10 as you exhale, then gradually work your way up to inhaling for a 2 count and exhaling for a 20 count. Work on filling your lungs with air in a shorter amount of time and controlling your exhale to blow out in a steady stream for a longer amount of time. For this exercise, imagine there’s a candle in front of your face. Your goal is to blow out so slowly and gently that your breath doesn’t make the candle flicker. Fill your lungs with air, then exhale through your imaginary straw until you empty your lungs. Repeat this exercise 10 times. Start adding vocalizations to your breathing exercises. Say “B,” “F,” “S,” and “Sh,“ as you exhale. Extend the sound throughout your entire exhale by saying, “Beee-,” or “Esss-.” Try mixing up your counts for this exercise. Inhale for a 4 count, exhale for 8, then inhale for 2 and exhale for 6. Randomize your counts to mimic how you’d have to switch up your breathing during a song. Hum at a note in your middle register as you exhale. You can also try pronouncing syllables, like “Ba,” or “La.” Extend the sound evenly as you exhale: use your breath to keep the tone and volume steady throughout your exhale.

Please answer the following question: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Summarize this article: The suggestion is part of Project Brave - the outcome of an SFA working group tasked with improving and increasing the development of elite players. It recommends reducing the 29 funded academies to a maximum of 16. Mackay will consult member clubs in detail at four events this week. Under the plans, clubs will have their academies assessed by an independent company to assess which ones meet the new criteria. \\"We need to focus on the very best players in the very best academies with our limited resources we have,\\" SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said. \\"One of the recommendations from the working group was to have no more than 16 academies in Scotland defined as elite. Any club can put a bid in, and they will be independently audited against a defined set of criteria. If they are successful, they will be included in Scotland's list of elite academies.\\" Project Brave's recommendations: The working group for the strategy was formed in March last year, and initiated by Mackay's predecessor, Brian McClair. Clubs that do not meet the eligibility criteria for Club Academy Scotland status - and central funding - will still have access to funding from the SFA to enable them to continue running their academies. \\"We want to make sure that we get the best support to help us manage the migration to our new academy system,\\" Regan told the SFA website. \\"We have identified an organisation from Europe, Double Pass, who work with a number of key countries, including the FAs in England, Belgium, and others in Scandinavia. \\"They will be coming on board sometime in 2017 to start the auditing process to establish whether club academies meet the criteria we set out, and will be continually reviewing academies into next year to make sure they are the standard we need.\\" In his first major task since succeeding McClair in December, Mackay will give presentations to member clubs in the academy programme at events at St Johnstone, Kilmarnock, Oriam and Hampden Park. Club feedback will then be incorporated into the final report before Project Brave becomes operational at the start of season 2017/18. Summary:","completion":"The Scottish Football Association (SFA) is proposing to reduce the number of funded academies under its Project Brave programme. The project, overseen by an SFA working group, would reduce the number of academies from 29 to a maximum of 16, with elite academies being assessed by an independent company.

The story is narrated by Clarence Harvey \\"Cookie\\" Cook (Gil Stratton). The camp holds Poles, Czechs, Russian females and, in the American compound, 640 sergeants from bomber crews, gunners, radiomen, and flight engineers. Manfredi (Michael Moore) and Johnson (Peter Baldwin) try to escape through a tunnel, but are shot by waiting guards when they emerge outside the barbed wire fence.

We clashed about something so important I can’t even remember what it was. We hadn’t really ever had that happen while engaged. Suddenly we realized that the bliss and excitement was growing into, well, everyday life. And all that passionate romance that had driven our relationship was growing, well, less passionate. We both realized our marriage had entered a new phase, one of many, through the years. And we needed to be much more purposeful about making sure it worked. Purposeful because the blinding emotional love some days seemed to be asleep. Yet, we both had committed to our marriage. For better or worse. So we decided we had the potential for either. We needed to make it better or it would become worse. We learned to really talk. Even when it was difficult. We learned to argue without hurting each other. We purposefully expressed love even in those times we didn’t especially feel it. We built romance into our relationship even when we didn’t feel romantic. And through the years our relationship has grown. Sometimes through difficult times. Heck, sometimes through difficult eras. Yet, we both never gave up the dream of making our marriage great. We never gave up the ideal of living together in love for a lifetime. And because of that, through all the trials and triumphs. Through all the frustration and bliss. Through all the sameness and romance. We still everyday enjoy our love and each other. And can’t imagine life without the other.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Marilyn Monroe’s iconic pose in front of Stamford church draws mixed reactions STAMFORD — It’s a jarring sight for members of the First Congregational Church: The underwear-clad buttocks of Marilyn Monroe mooning the downtown parish. A 26-foot Seward Johnson statue illustrating the star in her iconic pose from “The Seven Year Itch” was installed this week in Latham Park as part of the Stamford Downtown Special Services District’s “Art in Public Places” series that lasts through the summer. But much like the subway grate stirred up her skirt, Monroe has created a whirlwind in just a few days in Stamford. Lorri Tamburro, a lifelong Stamford resident, was disturbed when she visited the statue with her husband and watched children climbing up Monroe’s leg and looking up her skirt. “I just find the position to be offensive,” she said. “It was, in my eyes, very disrespectful. I looked at it and I think because of what I saw with all these little kids looking up, the height is ruining it. It’s ruining beautiful Marilyn.” Now Playing: Tamburro isn’t the only one disturbed by the pose. City officials said they’ve received a handful of phone calls about the statue and social media has been abuzz with reactions, mostly about its placement in front of the Walton Place church. On Thursday night, The Avon Theatre, which sponsored the statue’s installation, held a screening of the film that made the pose famous. Some 100 residents and civic leaders descended on the park for bruschetta and rose as the sun started to set on the massive woman, including several men who flitted behind the statue for photos from a different vantage point. Even young children were drawn to the statue, using her base and legs as a playground and sat eating snacks below her billowing dress. Alan Kalter, who gained fame as the announcer for “Late Night with David Letterman,” praised the artwork as he attended Thursday’s event. “If art is supposed to create talk,” Kalter said, “well, they’re talking.” Monroe has already been attracting people downtown. Marilyn Lodato, of Shelton, noticed the statue while in Stamford for work. Lodato is not only a big Monroe fan, she was also named after her. “This is an iconic pose,” she said. “This art is incredibly well done from the details on her toenails to the shoes. I don’t think that it’s so offensive...I think it honors her.” Lodato said she knows “every tidbit” about the pop culture icon who, despite her glamorous image, was plagued by depression, substance abuse and anxiety before committing suicide at age 36. Still, Lodato said the actress would be pleased by the sculpture. “She would love it,” she said. “I think she would adore it.” Rev. Todd Yonkman, senior minister at the First Congregational Church, was away this week and could not be reached for comment. Pam Riley, a longtime member of the First Congregational Church, said she didn’t even look at the statue when it went up on Monday. “It’s disrespectful to the church,” Riley said. “Her skirt is up in the air and everyone’s under there looking up her skirt.” Like Tamburro, Riley said the statue would be less offensive if it wasn’t in front of the church. But some of her fellow congregants were less bothered by the pose and its location. “It’s wonderful for Stamford and Bedford Street,” First Congregational member Jean Meyer said. “We’re lucky to have that statue. You’re going to have different opinions on it, but you have to have a sense of humor.” Another First Congregational member, Michael Dagostino, said he preferred the pine tree that once stood there and was a focal point of the city’s Christmas decorations. “To me, it looks beautiful,” Dagostino said. “If God had something to say, he probably would’ve sent a bolt through it.” Stamford residents have complained about the statue replacing the Christmas tree. However, according to Stamford DSSD President Sandy Goldstein, the tree was not cut down to accommodate the statue. She said the tree was removed last month after it died of disease. “It was supposed to be a very hardy, strong, wonderful tree and it came in a little sickly looking, and within a month right after, even during the time the lights were on, it started to die,” Goldstein said. “It just turned brown and was dead.” Goldstein said the DSSD will purchase a new tree for the holiday season. She said if the former tree did not need to be cut down, the Monroe statue would have been placed in a different park.

(Associated Press) HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Marilyn Monroe's rear is getting some leers in Connecticut. A 26-foot statue of the actress has been placed in a Stamford park across the street from a church, which is getting a full view of her behind. It depicts the famous scene from 1955's \\"The Seven Year Itch\\" where Monroe holds down her white dress as air blows up from a subway grate. The back of the statue showing her underwear is clearly visible from the front of the First Congregational Church of Stamford. Some passersby this week said it was disrespectful to the church. Most church members have yet to see the statue because it was put up Monday as part of a citywide art display. But it is sure to spark conversation when they return for Sunday worship, said church member Maureen Matthews. \\"I think some people will be offended,\\" said Matthews, who is not bothered by the statue. \\"It is silly. There are bigger issues to worry about. But I'll be interested to see how people talk about it on Sunday.\\" \\"Forever Marilyn\\" is one of 36 statues by artist Seward Johnson that are on loan and on display in the downtown area through the summer. They're part of the city's annual \\"Art in Public Spaces\\" program. All the statues except Marilyn are life-size and depict people doing everyday activities. City resident Lorri Tamburro told The Advocate newspaper that she found it disturbing to see children climbing on the statue's leg and looking up the skirt. \\"I just find the position to be offensive,\\" she said. \\"It was, in my eyes, very disrespectful. I looked at it and I think because of what I saw with all these little kids looking up, the height is ruining it.

Goldstein noted there are many nude statues outdoors in Europe — and near churches — that are accepted by the public. \\"It is art and we don't believe it is offensive,\\" she said. \\"We absolutely mean no disrespect to the church.\\" The Rev. Dr. Todd Grant Yonkman, pastor of the First Congregational Church, has a sense of humor about the statue, but said it was an odd artistic choice. \\"The issue is, Why that statue,\\" he said in an email to The Associated Press. \\"Marilyn Monroe was an artist deserving our respect. Why appropriate her image in this way. Is this the best we can do?\\" He said he heard Monroe's husband at the time of \\"The Seven Year Itch,\\" baseball star Joe DiMaggio, was uncomfortable with her shooting the subway vent scene. \\"Maybe the city would let us give her some pants?\\" Yonkman said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A big statue of Marilyn Monroe was put in a park in Stamford, Connecticut.

Firstly, it mentions \\"while moving the antique,\\" which implies the object in question is old or vintage. Of the five options given, \\"hardware store,\\" \\"broom closet,\\" \\"puzzle,\\" and \\"old houses\\" can be ruled out as they do not typically contain moving parts or chimes. The clue that truly helps us choose the correct answer, however, is the phrase \\"a wooden rod fell out, but since it was just part of the chimes.\\" Chimes are typically found in wind chimes or clocks. Given that wind chimes aren't an option and considering that the antique is being moved and not a stationary building like an old house, the best choice left is an \\"old clock.\\" Old clocks, especially antique ones, often have chimes that make noise on the hour, which would require a wooden rod as part of the mechanism. Therefore a human would choose \\"old clock\\" as the answer because it aligns best with the clues given in the question, namely, the words 'antique' and 'chimes'.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The chapter ordered that 13 canons, including the succentor and the archdeacon, should immediately \\"erect, construct, build, and duly repair their manses, and the enclosures of their gardens within the college of Moray\\". The manse of the precentor, erroneously called the Bishop's House, is partially ruined and is dated 1557. (Fig. 2) Vestiges of the Dean's Manse and the Archdeacon's Manse (Fig. 3) are now part of private buildings.The hospital of Maison Dieu (the Alms House), dedicated to St Mary and situated near the cathedral precinct but outside the chanonry, was established by Bishop Andreas before 1237 for the aid of the poor. It suffered fire damage in 1390 and again in 1445. The cathedral clerks received it as a secular benefice but in later years it may, in common with other hospitals, have become dilapidated through a lack of patronage. Bishop James Hepburn granted it to the Blackfriars of Elgin on 17 November 1520, perhaps in an effort to preserve its existence. The property was taken into the ownership of the Crown after the Reformation and in 1595 was granted to the burgh by James VI for educational purposes and for helping the poor. In 1624, an almshouse was constructed to replace the original building, but in 1750 a storm substantially damaged its relatively intact ruins. The remnants of the original building were finally demolished during a 19th-century redevelopment of the area.There were two friaries in the burgh.

Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd. - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games). - The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994. - The 1952 Winter Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL 1952\\"), officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"VIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), took place in Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February. Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games, but World War II made that impossible. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events, which were held at Norefjell, from the capital. A new hotel was built for the press and dignitaries, along with three dormitories to house athletes and coaches, creating the first modern athlete's village.

He enters an orange room and, without warning, is killed by a trap. In another such room, five people â Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Rennes, and Leaven â meet. None of them knows where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the others that some rooms contain traps, which he learned by nearly being killed by one. Rennes assumes each trap is triggered by a motion detector and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the passageways between rooms. Quentin recognizes Rennes as \\"the Wren\\", an escape artist renowned for getting out of jails. After declaring one room trap-free, Rennes enters and is killed when he is sprayed with acid. The others realize that there are different kinds of detectors, and Quentin deduces that this trap was triggered by heat. Quentin believes each person has a reason for being there. Leaven is a mathematics student, Holloway a physician and conspiracy theorist, and the surly Worth declines to talk about himself. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap. They find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. When Quentin nearly dies in a room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, tensions rise due to personality conflicts and lack of faith in Leaven's system.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar?

This event transpired approximately 20 years ago, as noted at the beginning of the recount.

According to his assertion, he usually had the capacity to hold his drink as he characterized himself as a \\"seasoned drinker\\". However, that particular night turned out to be significantly different. The author's behavior became uncontrollably erratic. He was flirting with a barmaid, losing at pool, and even attempting to instigate conflicts with other patrons. His bizarre conduct led him to suspect that someone might have spiked his drink. Interestingly, he didn't consume much alcohol that night compared to his regular intake. The author woke up the next day in his bed, not remembering how he got there and suffering from a severe hangover. His girlfriend had left and although they were together intermittently for a few more years, they eventually drifted apart. Since that night, he has never returned to that bar out of fear of what the regulars might think of him.

An ice cap can bury an entire mountain range or region ( Figure below ). Glaciers come off of ice caps into valleys. Q: What are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley? Choices: - icebergs - glacial continents - ice floes - ice caps A:","completion":"The large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley are called ice caps. As mentioned in the provided paragraph, these ice caps can bury an entire mountain range or region, making them significantly larger than smaller, valley-confined glaciers. Glaciers then form off of these ice caps and extend into the valleys. It is important to differentiate ice caps from the other choices presented. Icebergs, for example, are large pieces of freshwater ice that have broken off from a glacier or an ice shelf and are floating freely in open water. They mostly originate from the calving of glaciers in polar regions and are distinguishable by their varied shapes and sizes. Glacial continents (which technically do not exist as a separate term) could be mistaken for continental ice sheets, which are much larger than ice caps. These ice sheets cover vast areas of land and currently, there are only two of them – the Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet. Ice floes, on the other hand, are flat, floating sheets of ice that aren't attached to any landmass. They can originate when sea ice breaks apart, or they may also form from freshwater sources. Typically, they are found in polar regions, such as the Arctic Ocean, where they drift and mostly follow ocean currents. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question, \\"What are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just a valley?\\" is ice caps. Unlike other ice formations like icebergs, \\"glacial continents\\" (which do not exist or can be mistaken for continental ice sheets), or ice floes, ice caps are large glaciers that have the potential to bury entire mountain ranges or regions, with glaciers eventually extending from them into valleys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Problem: how many seconds will a 700 meter long train take to cross a man walking with a speed of 3 km / hr in the direction of the moving train if the speed of the train is 63 km / hr ? Options: a ) 287 , b ) 288 , c ) 600 , d ) 277 , e ) 121 A:","completion":"To determine how long the train takes to cross the man, we need to find the relative speed between the train and the man and then divide the length of the train by that speed. Step 1: Convert all measurements to a common unit (meters and seconds). The speed of the man is 3 km/hr, which is equal to 3000 meters/hr. To convert this to meters/second we need to divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): (3000 m/hr) / (3600 s/hr) = 0.833 m/s. The speed of the train is 63 km/hr, which is equal to 63000 meters/hr. To convert this to meters/second we need to divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): (63000 m/hr) / (3600 s/hr) = 17.5 m/s. Step 2: Find the relative speed. Since the man is walking in the direction of the moving train, we need to subtract his speed from the train's speed to find the relative speed: Relative Speed = Train Speed - Man Speed Relative Speed = 17.5 m/s - 0.833 m/s = 16.67 m/s. Step 3: Determine the time it takes for the train to cross the man. To find the time it takes for the train to cross the man, we need to divide the length of the train (700 meters) by the relative speed (16.67 m/s): Time = Length / Relative Speed Time = 700 m / 16.67 m/s = 41.995 seconds.

A couple is planning to file a civil lawsuit against their neighbour after he shot dead their beloved pet dog when it ran into his backyard. Judy and Fred Galietta heard two shots after their six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, Sadie, ran into the backyard of retired police officer Christopher Gibbons' Hampstead, New Hampshire home. 'When I got to her, I knew she was dead,' Judy Galietta told WHDH. 'I lifted up her head and there was nothing. It's like losing a child. She was our life.' But Mr Gibbons claims the animal was pestering his pet rabbits and saw he had no choice but to shoot it dead - and police have revealed that the law is on his side. Scroll down for video. Battle: Christopher Gibbons, left, shot dead Judy Galietta's beloved dog after it went into his garden. He said he awoke on Saturday morning. to find the dog barking at the two pet rabbits he keeps in a pen in his back. garden, and feared the noise might give them heart attacks. 'I went to the window and looked and saw. and the dog was running round and round and round the cage jumping up on it and. clawing it,' he said. When screaming at the dog did make it stop, Mr Gibbons grabbed his AR-15 assault rifle and fired a warning shot from his second floor bedroom window before aiming for animal. 'I shot one round into the dog and killed the dog,' he said. Police said that Gibbons called 911 immediately after shooting the dog to report the incident, and initially claimed he did not know the animal. Killed: The Galiettas believe he shot dead their pet, Sadie, as revenge for their complaints about his noise. Scene: But Mr Gibbons said the dog was barking at and scaring his rabbits in this outdoor cage. But the Galiettas. insist he recognised the dog, who ran around their garden in summer. They said they think he aimed for the dog as they've previously. complained about Gibbons' target shooting. Lt. John Frazier from the Hampstead Police Department said: '[He] probably could have handled it a little bit differently, be more neighbour-like. But what he did is not illegal.' State. law dictates that 'any person may kill a dog that is… out of the care. of its owner… worrying, wounding, or killing sheep, lambs, fowl, or. other domestic animals'. There has been some contention over the exact meaning of the word 'worrying' and the Galiettas are now calling on lawmakers to scrap it from the law. Missed: The Galiettas said Sadie, a six-year-old Brittany Spaniel, was like a child to them. Sadness: Judy and Fred Galietta plan on filing a civil lawsuit against Gibbons and asked for a change in the law. In light of the incident, Rep. John. Sedensky said on Thursday that he plans to call a meeting with local. legislators to see if the law should be changed due to the different. interpretation of 'worrying'. Sen. Jim Rausch said the term 'worrying' was included to protect livestock, especially sheep, in situations where they may be chased by dogs, causing them damage while not being attacked. 'There is a legitimate reason for that terminology,' he said. 'It's not the law that's wrong, it's people not behaving.' He added: 'This situation just highlights that we. have individuals who use no common sense. This should have been resolved. in a manner of good neighborly relations.

Its wood-paneled trading floor was boxed up and moved to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1977. Now all-electronic, it accounts for just 0.5% of shares that change hands nationally. Yet each of the millions of buy and sell orders issued around the world for U.S.-listed stocks each day must scan the Chicago Stock Exchange's computers before it can be completed. The reason is a set of rules meant to make certain orders are always carried out at the best price available. It is called Regulation NMS, for national market system. Regulators installed the rules to modernize exchanges, boost competition and keep U.S. markets relevant world-wide. But as U.S. markets incur repeated technical glitches, such as a three-hour outage in a Nasdaq Stock Market data feed in August, many Wall Street executives blame the increased complexity of the securities markets. Behind much of that is a spaghetti-bowl of data streams and connections between brokers and trading platforms that grew out of Regulation NMS. The intense battle for trading business among a growing number of exchanges and private trading platforms, spurred by Regulation NMS, has created a fast-changing system that is tougher for traders to understand and navigate. \\"If you were to start fresh, you wouldn't build what we have today,\\" said Andy Brooks, vice president and head of U.S. equity trading at mutual-fund firm T. Rowe Price Group . Reg NMS, as it is often called, grew out of an effort nearly a decade ago to keep the U.S. abreast of financial centers such as London, Frankfurt and Hong Kong that were leaping ahead in embracing electronic systems. Securities and Exchange Commission officials worried that control of U.S. capital markets could begin to shift offshore if the U.S. didn't evolve. Some U.S. markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, remained beholden to trading-floor models. Regulators fretted that investors couldn't be assured of getting the most competitive price when buying or selling stocks under those old-school systems, because traders manning the exchange floors had too much leeway when it came to competing with faster-moving electronic platforms. The result was a drive to digitally stitch together U.S. markets. It meant tethering marketplaces more tightly than ever. Reg NMS, passed by the SEC in 2005 and implemented in 2007, sent the securities industry rushing to update the electronic pathways and spelled change for market participants ranging from exchanges to traders to brokerage firms. \\"Some of us were worried, and it was fair, that this was too big an item to chew, and that technology would not be up to the task,\\" said Roel Campos, then an SEC commissioner. \\"Obviously, it's led to the recent situation.\\" To some degree, brokers and exchanges already were scanning various markets to see who had the most competitive prices. Reg NMS greatly increased the amount of this scanning and required a more nearly instantaneous routing of orders to where the price was best. Let's say that—before Reg NMS—the New York Stock Exchange received an order to buy shares of XYZ Company, at a time when some electronic exchange was offering to sell XYZ shares for less than the NYSE's \\"offer\\" price. Instead of shipping the order to that electronic exchange for immediate execution, NYSE floor traders were allowed to adjust their own offer price, and fill the trade. It was as if the electronic exchange had a yield sign that let floor traders pass first. This worried some regulators because they feared that floor-oriented markets were holding investors back from getting the best price instantly. Immediacy is a concern in a world where prices are constantly changing as trades take place and new orders are placed or canceled. Reg NMS removed the yield sign. It required exchanges and brokers to immediately \\"hit,\\" or accept, the most competitive bid or offer prices posted at any U.S. trading venue that displays price quotes. It sped up the stock market. For a stock exchange, Reg NMS has made it more important to be able to display the best bid and offer prices. A heavy flow of orders can increase the chance the exchange has the best prices. To obtain robust order flow, exchanges offer incentives to trading firms whose business is to constantly buy and sell stocks—the firms known as market makers. The incentives take the form of rebates. Meanwhile, exchanges also charge fees to investors who want to accept the prices the market makers quote. Reg NMS cemented this pricing practice by allowing exchanges to continue charging such fees. But for the market-making firms, as they constantly place bids and offers for securities, the stock exchanges' frequently shifting rebates and discounts have become one more factor that must be taken into account. With more than a dozen U.S. stock exchanges and around 50 private stock-trading venues, this is another way the rule adds complexity to the financial markets. \\"We've got competition in spades now,\\" said Kevin Cronin, global head of trading for the asset manager Invesco Ltd. \\"What none of us really thought about was that the competition would be all about prices and rebates.\\" Sometimes, stock exchanges, in an effort to have the best prices, offer specialized trading services to capture business from certain types of investors. When they do, some other market participants are obliged to change their software. The NYSE in 2012 introduced a program it hoped would enable it to fill orders placed by individual investors at slightly more competitive prices. To do that, the exchange created a new method of determining which orders came from individuals and a method for quoting better prices for them. Knight Capital Group Inc., a trading firm that specializes in filling masses of orders shipped to it by brokers who cater to small investors, rolled out new software to interact with the NYSE program. On Aug. 1, 2012, this new software led to a colossal trading error, which cost Knight 461 million. While Knight accepted responsibility for the error, some trace the series of events back to the NYSE's Reg-NMS-inspired wish to improve its price competitiveness, and to a faster pace of change set by the current market structure. Following the adoption of Reg NMS, it became more valuable for a trading platform to qualify as a full-fledged stock exchange. The reason is that if an exchange displays the best price for a stock, then that is where an order for the stock must be filled. The same isn't true of other types of trading platforms, some of which don't publicly display price quotes. BATS Global Markets in Lenexa, Kan., in 2008 converted its electronic trading platform to a full-fledged exchange in order to better capture trading business under the new Reg NMS rules. Direct Edge Holdings LLC, based in Jersey City, N.J., followed suit in 2010. In addition, established exchanges such as Nasdaq bought up fading exchanges that once represented regional markets in Philadelphia, Boston and Cincinnati, rehabbing them as electronic platforms geared toward specific niches. From 2007 to 2011, seven new stock exchanges opened for business. Regulation NMS also spurred the proliferation of \\"dark pools,\\" which are private electronic trading venues that don't publicly display bid and offer prices. The fees exchanges charge to access their prices gave brokers added incentive to direct stock orders toward these and other private platforms, where trading is often cheaper. The new structure spawned by Reg NMS also ramped up cat-and-mouse games played by sophisticated traders operating in the stock market, some stock-market participants say. Computerized firms called high-frequency traders try to pick up clues about what the big players are doing through techniques such as repeatedly placing and instantly canceling thousands of stock orders to detect demand. If such a firm's algorithm detects that a mutual fund is loading up on a certain stock, the firm's computers may decide the stock is worth more and can rush to buy it first. That process can make the purchase costlier for the mutual fund. Financial institutions that make large stock purchases have long been accustomed to breaking up their orders to avoid tipping off the market. But because buy and sell orders now are bounced around so widely, it has become easier for algorithms to detect what institutions are up to, some investors fear. They say they have had to grow craftier and deploy high-tech countermeasures, further deepening the market's complexity. Last year, T. Rowe Price's Mr. Brooks and colleagues ran an experiment. They directed one of their brokers to buy 2.5 million shares of a heavily traded stock, then sought a step-by-step account of how the broker made the purchase. What Mr. Brooks learned shocked him, he says. To hide the purchase from fast-moving traders, the broker placed and canceled many smaller orders all across the stock market, creating a dense smoke screen of phantom interest in the security. In total, the broker offered to buy 750 million shares of the stock while actually purchasing just 2.5 million. Mr. Brooks said he is bothered by the potential distortions to the stock market such practices may create. The realization of how much market subterfuge there is \\"was a two-by-four to the head, when you see how dysfunctional this market can be,\\" Mr. Brooks said. \\"We're pretty certain things are overly complex, with 13 exchanges and 50 dark pools,\\" Mr. Brooks said. \\"It adds operational costs, it adds complexity, it's destabilizing…and the improvement from all this stuff is negligible.\\" Invesco's Mr. Cronin found something similar a couple of years ago when he requested a detailed sample of his firm's trading. A 1,000-share stock order, which is small for Invesco, traversed 10 separate exchanges and dark pools before it was filled. The order had also been sent to eight other venues where ultimately no shares were bought—but where other traders may have had a chance to catch wind of Invesco's strategy. \\"Technology should be designed to make things more efficient and more effective, not just more complicated,\\" said Mr. Cronin. \\"We're getting away from that core purpose.\\" Reviews of institutional trading costs by Investment Technology Group Inc., a New York brokerage firm that also runs a private stock-trading platform, found that while trading costs have been on the ebb for several years, big investors now pay slightly more to execute a large trade than they did in 2007. Though competition prompted exchanges to cut trading fees, costs associated with carrying out trades have gone up. \\"I don't think there have been benefits from Reg NMS,\\" said Jamie Selway, an ITG executive. \\"I view it as a nuisance, barnacles on the way the market operates, and it doesn't get us much.\\" With stock-market technical glitches continuing to pop up every few months, regulators at the SEC have been pressing the stock exchanges and brokerage firms to come up with fixes. As they do so, Reg NMS has been steadily creeping into the conversation. Morgan Stanley in May asked regulators to consider changing rules so that firms wouldn't be obligated to send business to tiny exchanges, arguing that the cost of connecting to minuscule markets didn't carry meaningful benefits for investors. The same month, market-structure expert Larry Tabb, CEO of the research firm Tabb Group, said Reg NMS had made the stock market less transparent and a trickier thing to navigate for big institutions, some of which he said had \\"come to loathe\\" the rule. Speaking broadly, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in October that the SEC should \\"do more\\" to review the framework of the stock market. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment further. Among SEC commissioners, there are growing signs of an inclination to revisit the rule, based on comments some have made in recent months. \\"A lot of things have evolved since Reg NMS\\" was implemented, said commissioner Michael Piwowar. He said he is discussing with other commissioners a possible multiyear effort to analyze the effects of the rule, and the evolved U.S. stock-market architecture. \\"As a general matter, retrospective analyses of existing rules is just good government,\\" he said. Others feel that despite the market's convoluted nature and blinding speed, Reg NMS is doing its job. Mr. Campos said that while he didn't oppose a review, \\"by and large, by a long way, the system works today. I think things could be better, but I don't lose sleep over Reg NMS.\\" Write to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"The increasingly complex U.S. stock market, involving a multitude of exchanges and private trading platforms, as well as repeated technical glitches, has led many Wall Street executives to blame a set of rules known as Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS).

By contrast, MRI shows numerous new demyelinating damage that actually correspond to relapses.\\" Let's dissect this sentence and explain its complex medical meaning. The patient in mention isn't experiencing or feeling any physical sensations of their condition worsening or any new neurological deficits - these deficits refer to any abnormality or damage to any part of the neuronal pathways, which basically are complex networks through which our brain and spinal cord communicate with the rest of our body. The 'etc.' in the context probably refers to other neurological symptoms that usually accompany the deterioration of nerve health, like muscle weakness, altered sensation like numbness or tingling, pain, and loss of balance or coordination. However, a contrast MRI shows a different narrative. MRI stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a type of imaging technology which utilizes strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate images of the inside of the body. This form of imaging is especially useful in visualizing the brain and spinal cord. In this case, the MRI reveals numerous new instances of demyelinating damage. Demyelination refers to the process of damaging or stripping off the myelin sheath - a protective coating that surrounds nerve fibers and helps in efficient transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells. When this sheath gets damaged, nerve communication can be slowed or completely halted, leading to various neurological complications. This demyelinating damage actually corresponds to 'relapses'. In the context of neurological diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a relapse refers to an episode where new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen, typically lasting for more than 24 hours. The point being made here is that while the patient might not feel any new symptoms or worsening state, the MRI scans still display signs of progressing neurological damage, which would technically constitute a relapse. The disconnect between the physical experiences of the patient and their MRI findings is a critical facet of managing and understanding neurological conditions like MS."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks work by overloading websites or other online services with traffic. They have the power to knock whole sites offline and are usually carried out by automated bots or programs. Victims of such attacks in the past month include the Irish National Lottery and the BBC while in 2014 the popular videogame Wurm was also hit. 'Arms race' Darren Antsee, chief security technologist at software company Arbor Networks, believes the world is in an \\"arms race\\" between those carrying out DDoS attacks and those who try to defend against them His firm conducts an annual survey of internet service providers on the subject and the company also takes in data from its \\"Atlas\\" system - which monitors 300 providers every hour. Mr Antsee says this gives the firm an idea of what's happening across \\"about a third of the internet\\". A newly published report from the company suggests attacks are getting bigger and more sophisticated - with more and more businesses suffering. More than 200 of the reported attacks in 2015 summoned 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of traffic, with the largest of these clocking in at 500 Gbps - enough to disrupt an entire internet service provider's network. To put that in context, in 2014 internet connectivity for the entire country of Kenya was about 500 Gbps. But Mr Antsee says the larger attacks are not the real story. Instead, it's the \\"big jump\\" in more sophisticated DDoS raids which, though smaller in terms of gigabits per second, target specific parts of a website which are more easily overwhelmed. Petty cyber crime These often involve some clever analysis of how a website functions before an attack is launched, according to John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer at DDoS protection service Cloudflare. \\"If you know that, say, on an e-commerce website, adding something to the basket takes a long time, what we'll see is attackers doing that over and over again to consume resources,\\" he says. What's even more worrying is that there is now a wide range of \\"booter\\" services which offer to launch DDoS against specific targets for as little as 10 (£7). \\"My sense is that DDoS is just part of the internet at this point - it happens,\\" adds Mr Graham-Cumming. \\"It's a bit like petty crime.\\" Many motives Mr Antsee concurs and points out that a variety of motivations could prompt attacks these days. The most common now, according to the Arbor Networks survey, is criminals flexing their muscles against online targets to demonstrate their capabilities. Businesses occasionally dabble in attacking competitors, and there are also reports of individuals using DDoS for extortion - in which a ransom fee is demanded from the owners of a victim site. Finally, it's also sometimes the case that DDoS attacks will take place for \\"ideological\\" reasons - a website supporting a political viewpoint might be thrown offline by supporters of the opposing view, for example. In terms of protection, companies like Cloudflare offer to analyse web traffic for signs of malicious requests which can often weed out unwanted connections. Mr Antsee adds that \\"infrastructure access control lists\\" (ACLs) can be installed in routers and switches to detect suspicious patterns in traffic. Information overload However, the more sophisticated attacks mentioned above which target weak points in a website's structure are not always preventable with such technology. \\"You need to be using more intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to absorb that kind of traffic,\\" says Mr Antsee. Interestingly, he also comments that there is quite a large disparity between the number of attacks like this detected by service providers and the number seen by businesses - suggesting that more might need to be done before their true scale is understood. As a result of these developments, it is widely expected that the market for DDoS protection services is set to grow this year. Indeed, 74% of service providers surveyed by Arbor said they had seen an increase in such protections among their customers. \\"We certainly don't see things slowing down, the reality is, for a lot of websites, it's easy to knock them offline and so people do it,\\" notes Mr Graham-Cumming. He adds that these days, it seems as though anyone could be a target. \\"Who gets DDoS'd?

Earlier, sources said it would be delayed - but First Secretary of State Damian Green said he \\"can't confirm anything yet\\". Labour said the government was \\"in chaos\\". Mrs May is meeting her backbench MPs for the first time since losing the Tories' majority in Thursday's general election. The Queen's Speech is written by the government and presents an outline of its planned legislation for the next Parliamentary session. Mr Green cited the ongoing negotiations with the DUP when he was asked if next Monday's speech had been delayed. \\"I can't confirm anything yet until we know the final details of the agreement,\\" he said. \\"We know those talks are going well and also we know that, at this very important time, we want to produce a substantial Queen's Speech.\\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was an \\"ambiguity\\" about both what would go in it - with several manifesto pledges expected to be watered down or dropped - but also the need for the Tories to \\"nail down\\" DUP support. A defeat for its Queen's Speech would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the new minority government, he said. One of the reasons for the delay is also believed to be because the speech has to be written on goat's skin parchment, which takes a few days to dry - and the Tory negotiations with the DUP mean it cannot be ready in time. Although it is rare for a Queen's Speech to be delayed, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition government in 2010, it did not take place until 20 days after the general election while in 1992 nearly a month elapsed between polling day and the government announcing its new programme. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: \\"This is an utter humiliation for Theresa May. It is time to stop trying to cling to power and time to admit enough is enough.\\" Meanwhile, the backbench 1922 Committee is expected to raise concerns about the PM's leadership style, and press for more details on talks with the DUP. The committee is made up of all Conservative backbenchers - the name is taken from the year in which its original members were elected. Its primary function is to keep the leadership of the party informed of the mood among the rank and file, and if a Conservative leader or other senior figure loses its support they could be in a particularly vulnerable position. Mrs May's new cabinet also met for the first time after a reshuffle. Earlier Brexit Secretary David Davis predicted some parts of the Tory manifesto would have to be \\"pruned\\" following the election result. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said that while the Tory election campaign had been disappointing, Mrs May was a \\"formidable prime minister\\" and accused people speculating about her leadership of \\"the absolute height of self-indulgence\\". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has accused Mrs May of \\"squatting\\" in No 10, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the country \\"cannot go on with a period of great instability\\". On Sunday evening the PM finalised her cabinet with a small reshuffle, with Michael Gove returning to a ministerial role as environment secretary. Mr Gove, who took on Mrs May for the party leadership after David Cameron quit, was sacked by the PM in her reshuffle in July last year. A number of high-profile members kept their posts in the reshuffle, with Philip Hammond staying at the Treasury, Boris Johnson remaining at the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd keeping the Home Office brief. But some changed jobs too, with Liz Truss being demoted from justice secretary to become chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Green, who was work and pensions secretary, was promoted to become the first secretary of state - effectively Mrs May's second in command. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Widespread demands for Mrs May to go are not expected at Monday's 1922 Committee meeting. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: \\"It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably.\\" Another said: \\"Party members have been too bruised by her.\\" \\"She has bought herself some time\\", said another senior backbencher, but added: \\"How she behaves will determine how long she's there.\\" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. Read more from Iain Watson here. After speculation in the Sunday newspapers that he was mounting a leadership challenge, Mr Johnson has called for Tory MPs to back Mrs May. Writing in Monday's Sun, the foreign secretary said those calling for the PM to step down should \\"get a grip\\", adding the electorate wanted the government to \\"get on with the job\\". Mr Johnson admitted the prime minister's election campaign did not go well - \\"to put it mildly\\" - and that Tory messages \\"got lost or misunderstood\\". But he added: \\"Theresa May led a campaign that inspired 13.7m people to vote Conservative, in the biggest total tally of Tory votes since the days of Margaret Thatcher. \\"That is a stunning achievement, for which she deserves the support of her party. And she will certainly get it from me.\\" He also said the proposal of a deal with the DUP to keep her minority government in power was \\"feasible\\". \\"The people of Britain have had a bellyful of promises and politicking,\\" he wrote. \\"Now is the time for delivery - and Theresa May is the right person to continue that vital work.\\" The return of Mr Gove to the front bench as environment secretary has been a shock to some, including the politician himself. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said he had been \\"quite surprised\\" to be asked to rejoin the cabinet. He added: \\"Of course I knew that today was reshuffle day, but I genuinely didn't expect this role - although I am delighted to be part of the government, and delighted to be able to support Theresa.\\" However, the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin said green campaigners were angry at Mr Gove's appointment, pointing to his time as education secretary, when he tried to remove climate change from the geography curriculum, and as chief whip, when he reportedly blocked the then environment secretary from important international talks. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said: \\"It is hard to think of many politicians as ill equipped for the role of environment secretary as Michael Gove.\\" But others have welcomed the new minister. One senior farming industry source said they were happy that a \\"big hitter\\" was taking the top job at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra). \\"Defra has long been a backwater, so at last it's not someone in charge who is being put out to grass,\\" he said. Mr Gove promised to \\"protect our precious environment\\" in his new role.

A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the Royal Geographical Society. The governments of Bolivia and Brazil are nearly at war over the location of their mutual boundary and its direct effect on the region's extremely lucrative rubber trade, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rainforest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a jungle city covered in gold and full of people.

It seems that she might write about her experiences getting sober for the esteemed literary journal Celebuzz. Yes, Page Six has a source who tells them that Lohan has struck a deal with the website and will then maybe use that momentum to launch her own website, featuring \\"her musings on art, fashion, music and movies.\\" Aha.

Now, none of this is exactly confirmed, but when asked about a rumored meeting between Lohan and the site to discuss ideas, editorial consultant A.J.

Airlines improved their performance last year, with fewer lost bags and bumped passengers due to overbooking and more on-time arrivals, but travelers were still dissatisfied, according to an annual study of airline quality. Complaints to the Department of Transportation about airline performance went up a whopping 28 percent in 2010, the study said. A precise cause for the spike in consumer disenchantment is hard to nail down, but it's most likely due to changes in the way airlines are doing business, said Dean Headley, co-author of the report, which is based on Transportation Department data. The number of air travelers is increasing, but there are fewer flights and fewer seats available. So flights are more crowded, and it's tougher to rebook when a flight is canceled. \\"They are trying to match supply and demand _ the number of seats available to the number of people demanding seats _ a lot closer so they don't fly empty seats, which is expensive for the airlines,\\" said Headley, an associate professor of marketing at Wichita State University's W. Frank Barton School of Business. That increases the chances that some passengers are going to be unhappy because mismatches between passengers and seats available usually are managed to the airline's advantage, he said. \\"Even though airlines are vocal about saying they want to please the customer, when it comes right down to it, they're going to make money first,\\" Headley said. There were 1.22 complaints per 100,000 passengers last year, compared with less than 1 per 100,000 in 2009. An overall ranking of the nation's 16 largest airlines based on their combined performance in four categories _ on-time arrivals, mishandled baggage, denied boardings, complaints _ was coming out at 9:30 a.m. EDT Monday. The department doesn't keep records on the number of flight cancellations, but the biggest category of complaints was \\"flight problems,\\" which includes cancellations and delays. Industry officials had predicted that cancellations would increase as a result of new federal rules that bar airlines from keeping passengers waiting in planes longer than three hours without giving them a chance to get off. Such \\"tarmac strandings\\" have plummeted since the rules, which include fines of as much as 27,500 per passenger per violation, took effect. Headley said it's hard to know if there were more cancellations, and if so, whether they were due to the rules or other factors such as storms. Southwest Airlines maintained its ranking as the airline with the lowest consumer complaint rate, 0.27 per 100,000 passengers in 2010. Delta had the worst rate again, 2 per 100,000 passengers. Four of every eight domestic flights arrived on time last year, a slight increase from 2009. Over the past 20 years, on-time performance has ranged from a high of 82.5 percent in 1991 to a low of 72.6 percent in 2000. Eleven airlines improved in this category last year, and eight had an on-time arrival percentage over 80 percent. Hawaiian Airlines was the best, at 92 percent. Comair, a regional airline, was last at 73 percent. Last year's rate of 3.5 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers was the best in the two decades that the study has been produced. This rate peaked in 2007 at 7.01 mishandled bags. After that, many airlines began charging for checked baggage. That, in turn, has reduced the number of bags passengers are checking. Low-cost carrier AirTran had the best baggage handling rate, 1.6 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers; American Eagle had the worst, 7.15. The worst year for involuntary denied boardings, which are mostly due to overbooking, was in 2009 when they reached 1.19 per 10,000 passengers. That rate was down slightly last year, to 1.08. American Eagle had the highest rate, at 4 per 10,000 passengers. Jet Blue, which has a policy against overbooking, had the lowest, 0.01. The ratings are based on statistics for airlines that carry at least 1 percent of the passengers who flew domestically last year. The research is sponsored by Purdue University in Indiana, and by Wichita State University in Kansas. ___ Online: Study site: http://www.aqr.aero Federal Aviation Administration: http://www.faa.gov Bureau of Transportation Statistics: http://www.bts.gov ||||| This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Despite improvements in airline performance, including fewer lost bags and bumped passengers due to overbooking, traveler dissatisfaction increased in 2010 with complaints to the Department of Transportation rising by 28%.

Tropical Storm Ernesto moves toward pass along coast of Honduras TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras – Tropical Storm Ernesto's forward movement slowed a bit early Monday as it headed for an expected close pass along Honduras' northern coast after dropping heavy rains on Jamaica without causing serious problems. The storm passed to the south of Jamaica, where authorities said rains fell over much of the island, particularly its eastern areas. Rain and wind began tapering off Sunday evening, but the government urged islanders to remain alert during the night and said fishermen should remain in safe harbors. Ernesto hasn't made any direct hits on land since entering the Caribbean early Saturday, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was predicted to stay offshore while swirling past Honduras by Monday night. Many Jamaicans stocked up on food and water before the storm made itself felt on their island, but few seemed worried. Daniel Edwards, who was bailing out his small wooden fishing boat next to a dilapidated dock in Port Royal, a small fishing village, said he wasn't overly concerned by the storm. \\"It's not much of a muchness,\\" the veteran fisherman said. Forecasters said Ernesto could bring rain to the coast of Honduras on Monday. It is then expected to grow to near-hurricane force before moving ashore near the Belize-Mexico border early Wednesday and eventually passing into the southern Gulf of Mexico. A tropical storm warning was issued early Monday for the coast of Honduras, from the border with Nicaragua westward to Punta Sal, including the Bay Islands. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the main island of Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands to the north of Ernesto. A Cayman government statement urged Grand Cayman residents to monitor the storm but said it was not likely to have serious effects on the British Caribbean territory. Also, Mexico has issued a hurricane watch Monday for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The U.S. hurricane center said Ernesto was centered about 145 miles (235 kilometers) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Honduras border early Monday. It had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 kph) and was moving westward at 12 mph (19 kph). Far out in the Atlantic, Florence had weakened to a tropical depression Monday with maximum sustained winds near 35 (55 kph). Additional weakening is forecast and the U.S. National Hurricane Center says Florence was expected to degenerate within the next few days. Florence was centered about 1,610 miles (2,590 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. Why was the boy upset? A. because his grandmother was in the hospital B. not enough information C. he saw a deceased Santa Claus D. he thought he would no longer get any presents A:","completion":"The boy was upset for two primary reasons: C. he saw a deceased Santa Claus and D. he thought he would no longer get any presents. Let's break down how these reasons contributed to the boy's emotional state. C. He saw a deceased Santa Claus: The young boy, being only 7-8 years old, was likely very fond of the concept of Santa Claus and believed in his existence. In his mind, Santa Claus was a magical, benevolent figure that brought joy and happiness every holiday season. Seeing Santa's lifeless body with medical equipment attached and the costume cut up would undoubtedly be traumatic and distressing for a child. This sight shattered the boy's innocent perception of Santa Claus, and the tragedy of such an influential figure's death would have left the child devastated. D. He thought he would no longer get any presents: Additionally, the child's belief in Santa Claus directly tied to his understanding of how Christmas gifts were distributed. Since he saw Santa dead, he naturally assumed that there would be no one to deliver presents, resulting in him not receiving any gifts for Christmas. This aspect added to his distress and disappointment, overwhelming the young boy with sadness and worry. While one could argue that reasons A. because his grandmother was in the hospital could be a contributing factor in the boy's emotional state, it's important to consider the context and focus of the story. In this narration, the main issue lies in the boy's exposure to the harsh reality of the emergency room, particularly witnessing the deceased Santa, which resulted in his emotional upheaval about his understanding of Christmas and Santa Claus. The grandmother's hospitalization, while concerning, is not the primary focus of this situation, as the mother insisted the child could handle visiting the hospital. So, although the boy's grandmother being in the hospital may have been an underlying reason for his distress, the story emphasizes his reaction to the deceased Santa and the perceived consequences on his Christmas experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair? Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three.

Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. However, most doctors disagree. They say that they were asked to study medicine for a long time. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors say that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from the bank to pay their tuition. Because their money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So they charge people high prices for medical care.

In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land..., what would be the answer ?

Write highlights for this article: Celtic have been handed a sensational Champions League reprieve after UEFA ruled Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player against the Scottish champions. Henning Berg's side had advanced to the play-off round after winning the home and away legs on a convincing 6-1 aggregate. But a UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the European draws in Nyon decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - and advance on away goals - after Legia fielded defender Bartosz Bereszynski for the final three minutes of Wednesday night's win in Edinburgh. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ronny Delia following Celtic's defeat on Wednesday. Reprieve? UEFA have launched an investigation into Celtic's Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw. Suspended: Defender Bartosz Bereszynski came of for the final few minutes of the game. Going through? Bereszynski celebrates with team-mates as Legia Warsaw beat Celtic. Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players. News began to filter out for Uefa headquarters after the Legia chairman tweeted 'I failed' ahead of the official announcement. Red carded against Cypriots Appollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season Bereszynski was supposed to serve his suspension in UEFA competition this season. Unregistered for the second qualifying win over St Patrick's Athletic, however, the first opportunity to serve his ban came with during the Celtic tie. His late appearance as a substitute in the second leg was reported to the governing body by the UEFA match delegate leading to his eligibility being investigated. After being reinstated into the competition, Celtic were drawn against Maribor in the play-off round. Legia are likely to fight the decision after spokeswoman Elizabeth Kus said: 'This is the result of a misunderstanding. We have already seen comments appear which threaten us with expulsion, but this is absurd. UEFA have only asked us to explain.' Heat is on: Deila (left) sitting beside assistants John Collins and John Kennedy has suffered an horrendous start as Celtic boss following the Hoops failure to reach the group stage. Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda gave a scathing assessment of Celtic's performance after the first leg, he said: 'St Patrick's playerd a lot tougher against us than Celtic. They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw. 'With Celtic, we didn't know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.' In an incredible twist this is the second time in three years Celtic have gained a UEFA reprieve following an ineligibility row. In September 2011 Swiss club FC Sion were expelled from the Europa League for fielding ineligible players. Sion won the qualifying tie 3-1 on aggregate, but following an appeal from Celtic, UEFA awarded the Parkhead club a 3-0 victory for each of the home and away legs of the tie which sent them into the group stages. A UEFA statement said: 'Legia have been sanctioned for fielding an ineligible player (article 18 of the UEFA Champions League regulations and article 21 of the Disciplinary Regulations). The match has been declared as forfeit meaning Legia Warszawa have lost the match 3-0. 'As a consequence, Celtic have qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-offs on away goals (agg: 4-4) and Legia will compete in the UEFA Europa League play-offs. 'In addition the player Bartosz Bereszynski has been suspended for one additional UEFA competition match for which he would be otherwise eligible. This suspension shall be added to the remaining two match suspension which the player still has to serve in accordance with the Control and Disciplinary Body decision of 13 February 2014.' Hopeful: Celtic fans, pictured ahead of Wednesday's night clash at Murrayfield, will be hoping for a reprieve. Celtic will now be among the seeded teams for Friday's draw. Legia Warsaw have five days within which to lodge an appeal, and a statement on the Polish's club website indicated they had requested UEFA's reasoning for the ruling before making a decision. Celtic benefited from an ineligibility ruling during the 2011-12 season when they were reinstated into the Europa League group stages despite a qualifying defeat by Sion. The Swiss side were ruled to have fielded five ineligible players after breaching a FIFA transfer ban and failed to reverse the decision during a lengthy legal battle. Legia chairman Dariusz Mioduski vowed to challenge UEFA's decision. He wrote on Twitter: 'Today, the sport lost behind closed doors. We made a mistake, sorry, but the penalty is disproportionate. Stay with us. We fight on.' Highlights:","completion":"Celtic's soccer team got a second chance to play in the Champions League because their opponents, Legia Warsaw, made a mistake. Legia Warsaw let a player named Bartosz Bereszynski play in the game when he was not allowed to.

Process: - A sperm and egg meet inside a woman&#x27;s fallopian tube - The fertilized egg, now a zygote, travels to the uterus - The zygote implants in the uterus - The zygote becomes an embryo - The embryo becomes a fetus - The fetus grows for approximately 9 months - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby grows into a child - The child becomes an adult - The adult mates with another adult - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose they are not buried under enough soil happens, how will it affect no implantation of the zygote. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned refers to a situation where the zygote is not implanted in a sufficient amount of \\"soil,\\" which seems to be a metaphorical reference to the uterus. In the context of human reproduction, the \\"enough soil\\" represents a suitable environment in the uterus for implantation, growth, and development of the zygote, embryo, and ultimately the fetus. To analyze the potential direct or indirect effects of this perturbation on the overall human reproduction process, let's first understand the normal process and the importance of proper implantation. When fertilization occurs, the sperm and egg meet in the woman's fallopian tube and form a zygote. The zygote travels through the fallopian tube and eventually reaches the uterus. The lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, is crucial for the implantation of the zygote. The endometrium undergoes changes during the menstrual cycle to prepare for potential implantation, and when the zygote implants, this lining provides nutrition and support for the developing embryo. If the perturbation hypothesis were to occur and the zygote were unable to implant in the endometrium, several direct and indirect effects could take place: 1. Failure of implantation: Without implantation, the zygote cannot receive the necessary support and nutrition from the endometrium. As a result, it will not develop further and eventually be expelled from the body during menstruation. This can be considered a direct effect of the perturbation. 2. Hormonal imbalance: Implantation is a crucial event that triggers a series of hormonal changes in the woman's body. One such hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced after implantation, and it helps maintain endometrium thickness, prevents menstruation, and supports early embryo development. Without implantation, hCG levels will not rise, the endometrium may not be maintained, and the overall hormonal balance of the woman may be disrupted. This is a potential indirect effect of the perturbation. 3. Emotional and psychological effects: If a couple is trying to conceive but fails due to unsuccessful implantation, this can lead to emotional distress and frustration, which can impact their overall well-being and further complicate their reproductive journey. These psychological effects can be considered indirect consequences of the perturbation. 4. Reproductive intervention: In some cases, failure of implantation may prompt couples to seek fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI), in order to conceive. These treatments may carry their own risks and potential complications, which could be considered indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis. In summary, failure of the zygote to implant in the endometrium, as suggested by the perturbation hypothesis, would have significant direct and indirect effects on the human reproduction process. The direct effect is the inability of the zygote to develop, while indirect effects include hormonal imbalances, emotional distress, and potential reproductive intervention. Proper implantation is, therefore, crucial for successful reproduction and the subsequent growth and development of a human being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His response to \\"Siamese incursions\\" would launch the centuries-long Burmese-Siamese Wars between Burma and Siam. Siamese sources deny that Siam began the hostilities; rather, it was Burma's attempt to expand its territory eastwards taking advantage of a political crisis in Ayutthaya that started the hostilities. The Burmese king sent a sizeable force led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein of Martaban to drive out the Siamese forces from Ye and Tavoy in late 1547. Saw Lagun Ein's forces defeated Siamese forces led by the governor of Kanchanaburi, and retook down to Tavoy. Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, and planned an invasion of Siam itself. Next year, near the end of the rainy season on 14 October 1548, , 12,000 strong Toungoo forces led by Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung invaded Siam via the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces overcame Siamese defences, and advanced to the capital city of Ayutthaya. But they could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, in January 1549, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. On retreat, the Burmese tried to take Kamphaeng Phet, but it too was well defended by Portuguese mercenaries. Fortunately for the Burmese, they caught two important Siamese nobles in some open fighting, and negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the nobles in February 1549.

How many months after the October invasion did the Burmese retreat?","completion":"The Burmese invasion started in October and they retreated in February. If you think about it like a timeline, we have November, December, and January as full months that passed after the invasion in October. Then, when February comes around, that's when they decide to retreat. So that makes about 4 months after the invasion in October that the Burmese decided to retreat.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Information: - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In fashion, midriff is a term for the human abdomen. The midriff is exposed when wearing a crop top or some forms of swimwear. The cholis worn by Indian women exposes a thin section of midriff, usually 3 to 4 inches. - Satin is a weave that typically has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave is characterized by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are \\"floated\\" over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a \\"satin\\", although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen. - Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. Because the more technical term \\"costume\\" is regularly linked to the term \\"fashion\\", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while \\"fashion\\" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous. - Lingerie are women's undergarments, and may imply their being fashionable and alluring. - A crop top (also cropped top, belly shirt, half shirt, midriff shirt, midriff top, tummy top, short shirt, and cutoff shirt) is a top, the lower part of which is high enough to expose the waist, navel, or some of the midriff. The cropping of a top in this manner is generally limited to female garments. Bikinis and sports bras are generally not regarded as crop tops. - A camisole is a sleeveless undergarment for women, normally extending to the waist. The camisole is usually made of satin, nylon, or cotton. - Undergarments are items of clothing worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by bodily excretions, to lessen the friction of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, long underwear is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as T-shirts and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or textile, some undergarments can serve as nightwear or swimsuits, and some are intended for sexual attraction or visual appeal. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Nylon is a generic designation for a family of synthetic polymers, more specifically aliphatic or semi-aromatic polyamides. They can be melt-processed into fibers, films or shapes. The first example of nylon (nylon 6,6) was produced on February 28, 1935, by Wallace Carothers at DuPont's research facility at the DuPont Experimental Station. Nylon polymers have found significant commercial applications in fibers (apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), in shapes (molded parts for cars, electrical equipment, etc.), and in films (mostly for food packaging).<ref name=\\"Materials/Polyamide\\"></ref> - A bustier ( alternately bustiere ) is a form - fitting garment for women , which is traditionally worn as lingerie . Its primary purpose is to push up the bust by tightening against the upper midriff and forcing the breasts up , while gently shaping the waist . Nowadays , it might also be worn as a push - up bra under a low - backed dress , or as a camisole for outerwear . The bustier can also be worn as a half - slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff is not desired . A bustier resembles a basque , but it is shorter . It reaches down only to the ribs or waist . Modern bustiers are often made with mesh panels rather than the traditional boning . - A choli (Hindi Nepali: , , , \\"ravike\\" Tamil: , Telugu: (ravike), although choli is the preferred word Telugu Kannada: ) is a midriff-baring blouse or upper garment in the Indian sari costume worn in India, southern Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries where the sari is worn. It is also part of the ghagra choli costume of India. - Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants of the genus \\"Gossypium\\" in the family of \\"Malvaceae\\". The fiber is almost pure cellulose. Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will tend to increase the dispersal of the seeds.

In nearly 11 years as governor, he has not been known for his problem-solving or innovation. Perry has instead established himself as a power governor who doesn't like to be crossed, and many Texans are far more familiar with what he is against (like 'Washington') than what he is for. …President Obama has been legitimately criticized in recent months for not being a man with a plan for getting out of the nation's financial swamp. This will be the standard Perry must meet. He will have to take the political risk of laying out details.\\" By Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Iowa State Fair: GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, right, campaigns on Monday. By Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images Iowa State Fair: GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, right, campaigns on Monday. Ramesh Ponnuru and Rich Lowry, on National Review Online: \\"(Perry) gets an automatic entrée into the top tier and an excellent chance to become Mitt Romney's chief competitor, if not himself the front-runner. Besides Michele Bachmann, he's the only current officeholder among the top candidates. There's no arguing with his experience as governor the last 10 years of one of the country's most populous and economically dynamic states. He has a natural narrative as the outsider who has succeeded in addressing the nation's foremost problem — jobs. … He's a down-the-line conservative with a no-holds-barred combativeness when both substantive purity and a hard-line affect are highly prized by the party's grassroots.\\" Reihan Salam, on The Daily (iPad app): \\"At the heart of Perry's candidacy is the claim that he is responsible for Texas' relative economic health, including the fact that his state has an unemployment rate of 8.2% as opposed to the national rate of 9.2%. Democrats have attacked Perry's jobs record, claiming that (a) Perry is not responsible for Texas' success, and that (b) many of the jobs that have been created under his watch are low-wage 'McJobs' that don't merit kudos. These attacks will fall flat, regardless of merit, and Romney and Bachmann would do well not to parrot them. But there are other legitimate questions. … Conservatives have rightly condemned 'crony capitalism,' in which corporate insiders secure sweetheart deals from government. If Perry's Emerging Technology Fund and HPV vaccination requirements aren't prime examples, he should explain why.\\" Jeff Greenfield, in Politico: \\"Perry has been nothing but blunt about his disdain for Washington; about his view of Social Security and Medicare — probably the two federal programs that have the biggest impact on the lives of most Americans — as 'Ponzi schemes.' As a political matter, Perry himself has some tough questions to answer. … The larger issue is how deep the disdain for all things Washington has grown. To argue that the federal government has grown too large and too distant is one thing; Robert F. Kennedy, for example, made this argument often during his last years. To argue that there is nothing of moment that Washington should be doing marks a version of that argument that is nothing short of astonishing.\\" Ruben Navarette, Jr., on CNN.com: \\"If you want to compare Perry to someone, try Bill Clinton. Like the former president, Perry is the kind of candidate everyday Americans can relate to. He has abundant political skills. He is affable, charming and a great campaigner. His gift is that quality that Clinton had, the ability to lock in and make someone feel as if he is the only person in the room. That comes from liking people, and Perry does. Clinton was challenged by members of his own party, accused of not having core principles, criticized for occasionally saying the wrong thing and slammed for putting his interests before everyone else's. And yet, for all his imperfections, Clinton also racked up victories in two presidential elections.\\" , visit our FAQ's. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Few passers-by would have noticed the little brass plate commemorating her heroic part in the greatest rescue operation in British history – Dunkirk.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - A University Royal Naval Unit (URNU) is a Royal Navy training establishment connected to a university, or a number of universities concentrated in one area. There are 15 URNUs nationwide in the UK, and each URNU has land-based facilities near the university in question, up to four training officers (members of the Royal Naval Reserve) and, with the exception of Devon, a dedicated training vessel (an \\"Archer\\"-class P2000 fast patrol boat). - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. What is the relationship between 'archer-class patrol vessel' and 'patrol boat'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Archer-class patrol vessel is a specific class of patrol boat in service with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy. A patrol boat, in general, is a naval vessel designed for coastal defense, border protection, and various patrolling tasks. Therefore, the Archer-class patrol vessel is a type of patrol boat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Think about the ideals, values, and moral attributes that are important to you. These might include being a good friend or being healthy. Values and ideals are the ideas about life that you think you need to excel. They are different from goals in that goals are more concrete actions that can be completed. The first step is to figure out what excelling at life means to you, as well as for your values and the kind of life you want to have. It may take time to sort through all of these questions and to decide what excelling at life truly means for you. Try to create the broadest possible definition of excelling in life: short-term, long-term, big dreams and small successes. Get a journal or notebook that you dedicate solely to your new vision of your life and how you want to see yourself succeed. Start by making a list of all the ways you could excel at life, whether they are realistic or not. Write down your highest aspirations all the way down to simple things like doing the dishes every day. You may find that your definition of excelling at life can start with making small changes every day, whether it has to do with your personal health, finances, career goals, family, romance, personality traits such as being more kind, or nurturing your friendships. Look at your list of the ways you can excel. Then look at your list of values and ideals. Begin to figure out how they match up. Which goals accentuate your views about life and the kind of person you want to be? Start to group the ways you want to excel into similar categories, such as career goals, hobby goals, health goals, family and friendship goals. Then group these into long-term and short-term goals. You might have a health goal of being able to weight-lift 300 pounds, or you might have a career goal of becoming a journalist, or you might want to wash the dishes every night. Now that you have started to get clear on what excelling means for you, start prioritizing your goals. Which ones are long-term goals that will make you feel like you are excelling at life? Which goals can you practice on a daily basis in order to feel like you are living your life in a positive direction? Excelling at life can be as simple as interacting with people with kindness, being a more organized person, investigating bigger life changes like a career change, or making an effort to spend more time with your family and friends. The most important part of defining what excelling at life is for you is that it resonates with who you are as an authentic person and what kind of life you want to live. Your journal will become your personal source for focus and inspiration. Perhaps you have people in your life who inspire you because of their attitudes, strength, and perseverance. Find a picture of them or something that reminds you of them, and paste it in your journal. Use your role models to inspire you and remind you of what you aspire to be. You can also consider famous people, such as musicians or athletes, who inspire you because of their life, their actions, or that you can look up to and admire. For example, the Dalai Lama has been a symbol of peace for decades, even under great adversity. You don’t have to become the Dalai Lama to remind yourself of his strength and attitude. This reminder can help you stay focused on the kind of person you want to be and the life you want to live. Think of these people as inspirational tools.

California Answer:","completion":"Title: Golden State Secrets Setting: California, United States Plot: Step 1: Introduce the main character and family. The story revolves around the Thompson family, consisting of parents Michael and Susan, their teenage children Emily and Jake, and their dog, Max. They live in a comfortable suburban home in a picturesque California town. Step 2: Establish the family's relationships and routines. The Thompson family appears to live a typical suburban life. Michael works as an architect while Susan is a successful lawyer. Emily, an aspiring artist, frequently clashes with her more conventional parents, while Jake, an awkward yet brilliant teenager, becomes increasingly engrossed in the study of local history. Step 3: Introduce a mysterious subplot. As Jake delves deeper into the town's history-driven by a school project-he inadvertently uncovers evidence of a dark secret regarding a prominent family who once resided in their very home. The previous family vanished under mysterious circumstances, and their tragic story has never been truly resolved. Step 4: Kickstart the family's journey. As strange occurrences begin to plague the Thompson's home and the surrounding area, Jake shares his findings with his skeptical family. They embark on a journey to unravel the truth behind the tragedy that befell the previous family, searching for hidden clues, seeking out the few remaining witnesses, and uncovering long-buried secrets. Step 5: Escalate tension and danger. As the Thompson family moves closer to the truth, their lives become increasingly jeopardized. At every turn, they are met with danger, resistance, and fear from those who wish for the secrets to remain hidden. Emily's artistic skills and Jake's historical knowledge prove invaluable in deciphering the enigmatic history surrounding their home. Step 6: Reveal the dark truth. The family's investigation leads them to the shocking revelation that the previous family's patriarch was involved in criminal activities and had made a dangerous enemy. Facing severe consequences, the previous family was forced to flee, leaving their mansion and life behind in an attempt to save themselves. Step 7: Resolve the conflict and restore peace. The Thompson family members put themselves in the line of duty; they work together to expose the truth, bring justice to the previous family, and confront the dangerous forces that had disrupted their once idyllic suburban life. By doing so, they solve the mystery and restore peace to their town, becoming local heroes in the process. Step 8: Conclude the story with emotional growth. The Thompson family emerges from their harrowing adventure stronger and more united than ever before. The experience allows them to appreciate each other's differences and celebrate the bonds that keep them together. As life returns to normal, they cherish the memories and lessons learned in their journey through Golden State Secrets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Add punctuation to the following sentence: Photos hold the precious memory of you","completion":"The sentence you've provided, \\"Photos hold the precious memory of you\\", already contains correct punctuation. Here's why: 1. \\"Photos\\" - This is the subject of the sentence, which is plural. No punctuation is required. 2. \\"hold\\" - This is the verb of the sentence, connecting the subject \\"Photos\\" to the object. No punctuation is required. 3. \\"The precious memory of you\\" - This is the object of the sentence “memory“, further qualified by the two descriptors \\"precious\\" and \\"of you\\". No punctuation is required between the descriptors and the object. The sentence ends with an appropriate punctuation - the full stop/period. However, if you want to add additional punctuation for stylistic purposes, or provide emphasis, you might consider the sentence: \\"Photos, hold the precious memory of you.\\" But, note that this transforms the sentence into an imperative statement, as if you are instructing the photos to hold the memory. Alternatively, if this sentence is part of a dialog where we need to indicate the sentiment of the person, punctuations can be used such as: \\"Photos hold the precious memory of you...\\" The ellipsis at the end suggests that there's more left unsaid or that the speaker is lost in thought.

Abstract: PURPOSE To define copy number alterations and gene expression signatures underlying pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG). PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a high-resolution analysis of genomic imbalances in 78 de novo pediatric HGGs, including seven diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and 10 HGGs arising in children who received cranial irradiation for a previous cancer using single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis. Gene expression was analyzed with gene expression microarrays for 53 tumors. Results were compared with publicly available data from adult tumors. RESULTS Significant differences in copy number alterations distinguish childhood and adult glioblastoma. PDGFRA was the predominant target of focal amplification in childhood HGG, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and gene expression analyses supported an important role for deregulated PDGFRalpha signaling in pediatric HGG. No IDH1 hotspot mutations were found in pediatric tumors, highlighting molecular differences with adult secondary glioblastoma. Pediatric and adult glioblastomas were clearly distinguished by frequent gain of chromosome 1q (30% v 9%, respectively) and lower frequency of chromosome 7 gain (13% v 74%, respectively) and 10q loss (35% v 80%, respectively). PDGFRA amplification and 1q gain occurred at significantly higher frequency in irradiation-induced tumors, suggesting that these are initiating events in childhood gliomagenesis. A subset of pediatric HGGs showed minimal copy number changes. CONCLUSION Integrated molecular profiling showed substantial differences in the molecular features underlying pediatric and adult HGG, indicating that findings in adult tumors cannot be simply extrapolated to younger patients. PDGFRalpha may be a useful target for pediatric HGG, including diffuse pontine gliomas..

Deep Purple released 4 songs in the year 1984.","completion":"Based on the information provided regarding the Shades 1968-1998 4 CD-Box-Set by Deep Purple, we cannot definitively conclude that Deep Purple released 4 songs in the year 1984. The box set covers a wide range of songs and material from Deep Purple's career spanning 1968 to 1998, but it does not necessarily document every song or release from the band during that period. To assess the conclusion that Deep Purple released 4 songs in 1984, it would be necessary to analyze the band's specific releases from that year, including album releases, singles, and any other related material. Given that the band has a long and prolific history, it is certainly possible that they released multiple songs in 1984, but we cannot determine the exact number of songs released in that year based on the information provided about the Shades 1968-1998 box set alone. Furthermore, the box set comprises rare edits, singles, and remastered versions of their biggest hits, but it may not include every single song or release from their extensive and varied discography. Therefore, the box set is not an exhaustive resource for identifying all songs released by Deep Purple in a specific year. In order to accurately determine how many songs Deep Purple released in 1984, it would be best to consult the band's official discography or other comprehensive resources with detailed information on their releases from that time period.

Available options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"3). No. The hypothesis \\"Most people are too drunk to finish all 24 questions.\\" is not necessarily true based on the provided premise. It's important to clarify what the MAST (Michigan Alcohol-Screening Test) is meant to do. The purpose of the MAST is not to measure immediate intoxication or determine whether a person is drunk at the moment, such as in a roadside test, but rather aims to screen for alcohol abuse and actual dependence. This means that its effectiveness and application would be utilized over a more extended period, evaluating an individual's pattern of behavior related to alcohol consumption. The MAST comprises 24 yes/no questions, which are intended to offer insight into possible problematic consumption patterns based on the patient's past and present behavior. These questions address various fields, including adverse health effects, legal repercussions, family concerns, and more stemming from the individual's relationship with alcohol. The goal is not to evaluate their current mental clarity or direct sobriety, but to assess their overall lifestyles and choices related to alcohol use. Therefore, it is not necessarily relevant how intoxicated an individual is when he or she takes the test. Even if a participant is under the influence during the test administration, it's the pattern of alcohol use and its impact on their lifestyle that is evaluated, not their immediate intoxication level. Further, it would be incorrect to assume that 'most' individuals undergoing such a test are too impaired to complete it accurately. Tests like the MAST are usually administered within controlled environments like clinics, hospitals, addiction treatment centers, etc., under the supervision of medical professionals. This makes it unlikely that the majority taking the test would be too intoxicated to complete it. In conclusion, the MAST aims to screen potential alcohol abuse and dependence primarily based on an individual's life choices and behaviors around alcohol use, rather than their immediate sobriety at the time of test administration. Thus, the hypothesis is not accurate based on the premise provided."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a statement and three sentences as choices.

I moved my wet clothing from the suitcase to the laundry bag, and as a result, the Pick your answer from: 1. suitcase became heavy.; 2. bag became heavy.;","completion":"2. bag became heavy. As the wet clothing was transferred from the suitcase to the laundry bag, the weight distribution shifted between the two containers. Since wet clothes are heavier than dry ones due to the additional water weight, this transfer significantly increased the laundry bag's weight. In this scenario, the laundry bag becoming heavy is a direct consequence of the mover's action. Meanwhile, the suitcase would become lighter as the wet clothing is removed, so it is not a valid conclusion in this case. To further understand this, let's break down the process step by step: 1. The individual had wet clothing inside the suitcase. Wet clothing tends to be heavier because the fabric absorbs and retains water, making it denser and more massive. Keeping wet items within the suitcase can also damage other belongings and cause unpleasant odors. 2. The person decided to move the wet clothing from the suitcase to a laundry bag. This decision effectively separates the wet items from dry ones, preventing damage to the other contents and stopping the spread of any unwanted odors. 3. As the wet clothing was moved to the laundry bag, the weight of each container began to change. The suitcase would become lighter, as it no longer needs to bear the burden of the wet clothes. Conversely, the laundry bag would take on the bulk of the mass, as it receives the clothes that were once in the suitcase. 4. The end result of this process is the laundry bag becoming heavy, as it now carries the full weight of the wet clothing. The suitcase, on the other hand, would experience a reduction in heft, since it no longer contains the water-laden items. So, based on the provided options, the correct answer is: \\"2. bag became heavy,\\" as it accurately reflects the transfer of weight that occurs when moving wet clothing from a suitcase to a laundry bag."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: In other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. For example, even though bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group (Figure 18.10). If humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an African fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would probably be infertile—unable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. Different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. Thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Who does Pete ask if he's seen a guy that he can't see?, using the article: Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen. Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen. But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again. However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete., what would be the answer ?

It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city. Because the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say. To keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati. Experts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \\"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc. While scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests. Still, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle. She has lived in Venice for 17 years. \\"There has always been high water in Venice.\\" Zwingle told WR News. \\"If high water really were a serious problem, people wouldn't be still living here.\\" What's the main reason Venice is sinking? A) Its population is rising. B) Its buildings are too weighty. C) The soil it was built on is not solid. D) Its underground water is being overused. A:","completion":"The main reason Venice is sinking is C) The soil it was built on is not solid. Venice was constructed on soft, marshy soil, which is not capable of supporting the city's weight over time. This has caused the city to gradually sink at a rate of approximately 2 inches every 100 years. Additionally, rising sea levels attributed to global warming and melting sea ice exacerbate the situation, threatening to submerge the city even faster. To combat the sinking, experts have proposed a plan to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. This would expand the sand under the city and provide better support for the islands. The intention is to preserve Venice, a city with immense historical and cultural significance, known for its contributions to the arts, opera, and maritime strength. In the meantime, local residents and businesses adapt to the rising waters and continue with their routines. They employ various methods to keep people and spaces dry during high tide, highlighting the resilience of the Venetian people.

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. Andrea believes that: - grand canal issues - Bridge issue - not enough information - waterway issue Answer:","completion":"Andrea believes that there are several issues related to the construction of the Rialto Bridge, such as the challenges posed by the Grand Canal, the structural concerns of the bridge, limited information on the best way to build the bridge, and the need to accommodate the waterway for boats to pass underneath. His design, which featured three arches, was rejected because it would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Antonio Da Ponte's design, which was ultimately chosen, addressed these concerns by providing a more practical and functional solution for the Rialto Bridge."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

A spokesman for the research team at Navarro University in Spain says,\\"Light to moderate alcohol intake,especially of wine,may be more likely to protect against,rather than promote,weight gain\\".The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research reviewed the findings and agreed with most of the conclusions,particularly that current data do not clearly indicate if moderate drinking increases weight. Boston University's Dr.Harvey Finkel found that the biologic mechanisms relating alcohol to changes in body weight are not properly understood.His team pointed out the strong protective effects of moderate drinking on the risk of getting conditions like diabetes ,which relate to increasing obesity.Some studies suggest that even very obese people may be at lower risk of diabetes if they are moderate drinkers. The group says alcohol provides calories that are quickly absorbed into the body and are not stored in fat,and that this process could explain the differences in its effects from those of other foods.They agree that future research should be directed towards assessing the roles of different types of alcoholic drinks,taking into consideration drinking patterns and including the past tendency of participants to gain weight. For now there is little evidence that consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis increases one's risk of becoming obese.What's more,a study three years ago suggested that resveratrol,a compound present in grapes and red wine,destroys fat cells.

A: Answer:","completion":"The device that you are referring to is known as a battery. A battery is an electrochemical cell or a series of cells connected in either series or parallel configuration that produces an electric current by converting stored chemical energy into electrical energy. The electrochemical cell consists of two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) and an electrolyte solution that facilitates the flow of ions between the electrodes. In a battery, the chemical reactions occurring at the anode and cathode cause electrons to build up at the anode, creating a potential difference between the two electrodes. When an electrical load (such as a light bulb or a motor) is connected to the battery, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through the external circuit, providing power to the load. Batteries come in various sizes and types, such as disposable (primary) batteries like alkaline or zinc-carbon batteries, and rechargeable (secondary) batteries like lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, or lead-acid batteries. They are commonly used in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and various industrial applications, among others."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: with grooming scissors and tweezers. Use a pair of grooming scissors to trim back any eyebrow hairs that are noticeably longer than the rest. Then, use tweezers to pluck out any hairs that are rooted outside the natural contour of your eyebrows. If your eyebrows are particularly bushy, comb through them before trimming so the hairs are lying properly. Or, wet your fingers a bit and smooth the eyebrows into place. You can keep plucking if you want to further thin out the natural look of your eyebrows, but that’s up to you. Use the grooming scissors that come with a typical grooming kit (along with tweezers, nail clippers, etc.), not the full-size scissors you’d use for a haircut. If you have any stray hairs growing off of the outside of your ear, either pluck them out with tweezers or cut them down as short as you can with grooming scissors. Remove each hair with a firm, quick yank of the tweezers, or pull each hair taut with the tweezers, then hold the scissors parallel to the flesh of your ear and cut the hair off at the base. Use tweezers to yank out any visible hairs growing from inside your ear canal. This will hurt a bit, but you can reduce the pain by gripping the hair shaft firmly with your tweezers and pulling quickly and firmly. Never stick grooming scissors or any other sharp object into your ears. Only pluck hairs from the inside of your ear if they’re visible outside your ear. Pull any protruding nose hairs in each nostril taut with your tweezers, then hold the scissors parallel to your nostril opening and cut each hair off as short as you can. Do not stick the scissors up into your nose to trim the hairs. Also, don’t pluck hairs from out of your nose—any minor bleeding may lead to an infection. Alternatively, you can purchase an electric nose hair trimmer. Models vary, but generally you'll just turn it on and stick the rounded trimmer into each nostril. Don't stick it farther up your nose than directed. Pluck or trim any rogue hairs growing on the top or side of your nose. If you’re going for a clean-shaven look, use a manual razor. Soften your skin and open your pores by showering or washing your face, then massage in a healthy coating of shaving cream. Shave in the direction of hair growth and rinse the blade often with clean water. Finish by rinsing your face with cool water, patting it dry, and applying an aftershave lotion or balm. Use a clean, sharp razor every time you shave. If the blade is getting dull or full of gunk, replace it. If you want to keep a tidy beard, use a grooming trimmer instead. Adjust the blade setting to your desired length setting and glide the trimmer over your facial hair in even, smooth strokes. If you have sensitive skin on your face that gets easily irritated by shaving, keep in mind that the same will likely happen if you shave other areas of your body. In this case, you may want to trim your body hair instead of shaving it. If you're shaving your face, just include the front of your neck in the process. Shaving the back of your neck can be a bit trickier. Either use a handheld mirror in one hand and the razor in the other, or find someone who's willing to give you a quick neck shave. If you plan to shave your back (which is also much easier with a partner), you can include the back of your neck in that process.

Summarize: The work, The Upper Class at Bay, has been installed in a bedroom at Frampton Court, while a tapestry that has hung there for 300 years is restored. The Turner Prize-winning artist, who stayed at the country estate in 2012 and was \\"inspired\\" by its owners, said it was appropriate it should be there. It is hoped the loan of the tapestry, will help fund the restoration work. The tapestry is one of six created by the artist five years ago alongside his Channel 4 series, All in the Best Possible Taste. Measuring 2m x 4m, it depicts an \\"aristocratic stag\\" being brought down by the hounds of tax, upkeep, change and fuel bills. In the background, Frampton Court can be seen along with the stately home's orangery. Perry - who stayed at Frampton Court while filming the Channel 4 series - has admitted that \\"some of the characters, incidents and objects\\" he had met had been woven into his tapestries. But he denied that the face of the stag was based on the owner of the Grade I listed house, Rollo Clifford. \\"My experience with Janie and Rollo was a big inspiration - any resemblance is purely coincidental,\\" he said. Mrs Clifford said the artist had been \\"enormously supportive and generous\\" in loaning them \\"his own tapestry\\". Craig Kempson, house manager at Frampton Court, said he was \\"intrigued to find out how our guests will react to it\\".

Paragraph: On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said.

Mr Zuma recently survived calls for his resignation by some senior ANC members. The allegations have been dismissed as a fabrication by Mr Zuma's lawyers. The Gupta family of businessmen has said the leaks were \\"politically inspired\\". Mr Zuma has become increasing unpopular in recent years amid accusations of corruption and not doing enough to tackle poverty. There have been mass protests calling for him to step down. One of the revelations in the emails, known as GuptaLeaks, is that President Zuma was hoping to take up residency in the United Arab Emirates. A claim that was denied. Others appear to show that the Gupta family exerts undue influence over the government. Have Jacob Zuma's nine lives run out? Milton Nkosi, BBC News, South Africa By calling for an investigation, the African National Congress is putting its own leader under pressure to come clean. At the centre of the alleged scandal is President Zuma's son Duduzane, a business partner with the controversial Gupta family. Some of the emails released by local media allege that Duduzane has been playing the role of middleman between his father and private business interests. This looks like the ANC is slowly washing its hands of its 74-year-old leader. They know he will not be at the helm in six months' time and so the dominos are beginning to fall.

There's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. \\"Igor and the Lunatics\\" is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Tara Ann VanDerveer (born June 26, 1953) is an American basketball coach who has been the head women's basketball coach at Stanford University since 1985. Designated the Setsuko Ishiyama Director of Women's Basketball, VanDerveer led the Stanford Cardinal to two NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championships: in 1990 and 1992. She stepped away from the Stanford program for a year to serve as the U.S. national team head coach at the 1996 Olympic Games. VanDerveer is the 1990 Naismith National Coach of the Year and a ten-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year. VanDerveer was born on June 26, 1953, to Dunbar and Rita VanDerveer, who named their first child \\"Tara\\" after the plantation in Gone with the Wind. She was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, a part of Greater Boston, but grew up in a small town in West Hill, near Schenectady, New York. Her parents were interested in a well-rounded education. Her father was studying for a doctorate at the school now known as the University at Albany. He took the family to Chautauqua in the summer, where she immersed in arts as well as sports. At the age of ten, her parents bought her a flute, and arranged for lessons. Two years later, one of the premier flutists in the world was staying in Chautauqua, and her father arranged for lessons with this distinguished teacher. Although she learned to play, she did not enjoy the experience, and gave up the flute in ninth grade. The love of music stayed with her though, and in later years she would take up the piano. There were no sports teams for girls when she was in high school, but she played a number of sports including basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her. Her father wasn't completely supportive of her basketball interest, calling her in from the neighbor's basketball hoop, telling her, \\"Basketball won't take you anywhere. Come in and do your algebra.\\" Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn't going to take her anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary's Athletic Hall of Fame.

Question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows.

There are hundreds of skills to help you read more in less time. Here are two skills that I think are very good. Preview -- if it's long and hard. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading like long magazine articles and science reports. Here is how to preview. *Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully. *Then read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs. Previewing doesn't give you all the details. It tells you not to spend time on things you don't really want or need to read. Skim -- if it's short and simple. Skimming is a good way to get a general idea of light reading, like popular magazines or the sports of your daily paper. Here's how to skim. *Get your eyes to move fast.

Read things all the time. This will make your vocabulary better and it will also help you learn grammar and slang. Read comics. An easy option, if you don't want to read children's books, is to read comic books or comics instead. You can buy many English language comic books in bookstores and online, or you can read free comics online (these are usually called webcomics). Read books you've read before. If you already know a little bit about what happens, then you will have an easier time guessing and understanding the words. Read the newspaper. Newspapers are a good way to learn the basics of a language, because they usually have very good grammar and are written to be easy to understand. You can find online versions of many good English language newspapers, like the New York Times or The Guardian. Watching movies will also help you improve your English, by helping you to hear what it sounds like and also helping you to learn new words. You can start watching with subtitles on, but you will learn more with the subtitles off. Once you have a basic vocabulary, try to keep the subtitles off and focus on listening for the words you do know and guessing the words you don't know from what is happening on the screen. MMOs are video games that you play online with other people. You can choose to play with people in English-speaking countries, which will give you the chance to talk with them and learn from them. Try playing Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, or The Elder Scrolls Online. Pen-pals are people trying to learn your language that you write letters (or emails) to and they write back. You write half of your letter in your native language so that they can practice and half in English so that you can practice. You can talk about whatever you want! There are many websites that can help you find an online pen-pal. You can also just make friends with English language speakers online and chat, email, and Skype together in order to practice your English. You can find online friends by joining fan communities or through language-learning communities like Fluentify. Learning and singing songs is another good way to make your English better. This will help you learn the sounds of English (rhymes will help your pronunciation). It will also help improve your vocabulary. Find a song you like, learn it, and learn what the lyrics mean.

Step 2: Conflict Justify: Introduce the conflict that drives the story Conflict Introduction: As the election season starts, both campaigns are in full swing. Morris's campaign team is entirely focused on being transparent and sharing their plans for the town, while Dan's team plays dirty tricks, such as running fake news smears against Morris and spreading rumors. Morris's campaign manager, Sarah, must find ways to expose the underhanded tactics, all while maintaining their position on clean, transparent politics. Step 3: Rising Action Justify: Develop the story with increasing complications and dilemmas Rising Action: As the tension between the two campaigns grows, Morris finds himself in a moral dilemma. He contemplates whether to confront Dan directly or continue down the path of a clean campaign. Meanwhile, Sarah digs deeper and uncovers connections between Dan and a corrupt local businessman who has been funding his campaign. As Morris is about to hold a press conference to expose Dan's connection to the businessman, he's blackmailed by an anonymous source with damaging information about his past. Step 4: Climax Justify: Create the most intense, emotional, or suspenseful moment in the story Climax: In a pivotal scene, Morris defies the blackmailer and publicly admits to a mistake he made in his youth. Ignoring the potential damage to his campaign, Morris decides to expose the truth about Dan's relationship with the corrupt businessman, ensuring that the voters have all the information they need to make an informed decision. Step 5: Falling Action Justify: Resolve the main conflict and bring the story toward a resolution Falling Action: In the aftermath of the press conference, Morris's honesty and transparency resonate with the townspeople. The public backlash against Dan's underhanded tactics forces him to publicly apologize and withdraw from the race. Morris's campaign gains momentum, and he wins the election by a significant margin. Step 6: Conclusion Justify: Finalize the story with a resolution and reflection on the events Conclusion: With a renewed sense of responsibility and commitment to honest politics, Morris is re-elected as mayor of Brooksville. The movie ends with a montage of Morris working alongside his administration, bringing about positive change to the town and creating a more transparent political environment. Through Morris's example, the town learns the importance of integrity in leadership and the value of honesty in all aspects of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Parts of a Typical Rib The posterior end of a typical rib is called the head of the rib (see Figure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal facet located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowed neck of the rib. A small bump on the posterior rib surface is the tubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the transverse process of the same numbered vertebra. The remainder of the rib is the body of the rib (shaft). Just lateral to the tubercle is the angle of the rib, the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The angles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align with the medial border of the scapula. A shallow costal groove for the passage of blood vessels and a nerve is found along the inferior margin of each rib.

The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? unforced","completion":"The phrase \\"unforced\\" is generally considered to be positive. However, the interpretation of this phrase can depend on the context in which it is used and the subject matter being discussed. To better understand the positive implications of the word \\"unforced,\\" let us examine its meaning and potential applications. \\"Unforced\\" is an adjective typically used to describe something that occurs naturally, without being prompted or compelled. It implies that the action, decision, or behavior in question is genuinely spontaneous and arises from an individual's preferences, natural inclinations, or genuine intentions. This spontaneous quality is usually seen as a positive aspect since it suggests authenticity and a lack of contrived effort or pretense. Some common contexts where \\"unforced\\" is viewed as a positive aspect include: 1. Communication and interpersonal relationships: An unforced conversation is typically seen as more honest, genuine, and enjoyable than a conversation that seems forced or overly structured. Similarly, unforced gestures of affection and friendship indicate that a person is acting based on their true feelings, rather than for ulterior motives. 2. Art and creativity: In the context of artistic expression, unforced creativity is often valued over calculated or formulaic approaches. When a piece of art or music is considered unforced, it means that the artist has created it spontaneously and intuitively, allowing their own distinctive style to shine through. 3. Sports and competitions: Athletes who display unforced skills are often admired for their natural talents and ease of movement. A player is said to have an unforced style if they can perform difficult maneuvers effortlessly, without appearing to exert much effort. This is in contrast to a forced or labored performance, which may seem less skilled or elegant. 4. Decision-making and problem-solving: Unforced decisions often indicate that someone has carefully considered their choices and acted based on their best judgment, rather than simply following external pressures or expectations. In some cases, \\"unforced\\" can also be used as part of negative expressions, such as \\"unforced errors\\" in sports. However, these instances are relatively rare, and the negative connotation arises from the context and the addition of the word \\"error,\\" rather than from the term \\"unforced\\" itself. In general, using \\"unforced\\" to describe actions, behaviors, or decisions is likely to convey positive sentiments about those actions' spontaneity, authenticity, and genuineness."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Would \\"The tags contain electronically stored information.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"No, \\"The tags contain electronically stored information.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question \\"How is an RFID tag powered?\\". A detailed answer to the question is: RFID tags are primarily powered in two ways: passive and active. I. Passive RFID tags do not have an internal power source. Instead, they draw power from the electromagnetic field created by the RFID reader when it emits radio waves. This energy activates the integrated circuit within the tag, which modulates the radio waves and sends the stored information back to the reader. II. Active RFID tags have their own built-in power source, typically a small battery. This power source allows active tags to emit a constant signal, making them more reliable and effective over longer distances. However, their operational life is limited by the battery lifespan. In summary, RFID tags can be powered either passively from the RFID reader or actively with their own built-in battery, and the provided answer does not accurately address the question."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: what is a penny made of I found the following answer on Google: The cent's symbol is ¢.

Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan's institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan's right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a \\"self-defense\\" force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan's militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan's future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan's auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of 25,000. It was Japan that produced the world's first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government's loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan's was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by \\"dirty\\" industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -5*a - 5 - 20 for a, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = -5*a - 25 Step 2: Isolate the variable (a). To isolate a, you need to get rid of the -5 next to it. Since -5 is multiplied by a, you will divide both sides of the equation by -5 to cancel it out and isolate a: 0 / -5 = (-5*a - 25) / -5 Step 3: Perform the division on both sides of the equation. Divide both the constant term and the term with the variable by -5: 0 = a + 5 Step 4: Solve for a. Now, you need to eliminate the constant 5 on the right side of the equation. Since 5 is added to a, you will subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to cancel it out and solve for a: a = 0 - 5 a = -5 So the answer to the equation 0 = -5*a - 5 - 20 is a = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Now, I have a new situation: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. Answer this question please: Which group has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0? Answer:","completion":"Group Yellow has a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0. Step 1: Identify the energy consumption of both groups. - Group Brown consumed an extra 3,500 Calories a day for 3 months. - Group Yellow maintained a normal diet. Step 2: Understand the effects of excess energy consumption on the body. - According to the background, an extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Step 3: Analyze the potential weight gain for Group Brown. - Over the course of 3 months (90 days), Group Brown consumed an extra 3,500 Calories x 90 days = 315,000 extra Calories. Step 4: Calculate the potential fat storage for Group Brown. - With the extra 315,000 Calories, Group Brown could potentially store 315,000 Calories / 3,500 Calories per pound = 90 pounds (40.8 kg) of body fat. Step 5: Assess the risk of obesity for both groups. - Since Group Brown gained a lot of weight due to their excessive calorie intake, they would have a higher likelihood of increasing their BMI and potentially crossing the threshold for obesity (BMI of 30.0 kg/m² or greater). - Group Yellow, who maintained a normal diet, would have a lower risk of increasing their BMI and crossing the obesity threshold. Based on this analysis, Group Yellow would have a smaller chance of getting a BMI above 30.0 compared to Group Brown, as they consumed a normal diet while Group Brown consumed excessive calories, leading to significant weight gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement is to meet changing conditions and provide excellent police service .

Wait for a few hours to allow the solution to soak into the nests and kill the bees. Step 3: Block the entrances - Use small pieces of steel wool to stuff into the holes, blocking the bees from reentering the nests. Make sure the steel wool is packed tightly to prevent the bees from pushing it out. Step 4: Repair the damaged wood - Apply a wood filler or putty to cover the holes and restore the wooden surface. Step 5: Prevent future infestations - Paint or seal wooden surfaces to deter carpenter bees from nesting. Regularly inspect wooden structures for new signs of carpenter bee activity.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the song whose central rift is in NWOBHM fashion?, using the article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working.

Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy.

Can we conclude that can i have a beard in the marines? Possible answers: (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"(A). no In the United States Marine Corps, having a beard is generally not permitted due to multiple factors that influence the rules and regulations governing the personal appearance of service members. These factors include hygiene, the necessity of a proper seal when using protective masks in the case of a chemical weapon attack, and the importance of uniform personal appearance to maintain discipline and build a sense of camaraderie among Marines. First and foremost, the issue of hygiene is a critical concern in the armed forces. Beards can harbor bacteria and dirt, which can lead to skin infections and other health problems. This is especially important in combat situations where maintaining cleanliness and optimal health is essential for the effectiveness and safety of service members. In addition, facial hair can interfere with the proper fitting and sealing of a protective mask, which is crucial in protecting Marines from chemical and biological threats. Another factor contributing to the prohibition of beards in the Marine Corps is the significance of uniform personal appearance in fostering discipline and a sense of camaraderie among servicemen and women. The enforcement of grooming standards fosters an environment of professionalism, order, and unity among Marines. There are, however, some limited exemptions made on the basis of religious accommodation. In these cases, individuals can apply for a waiver to grow a beard as a reflection of their religious beliefs, provided that it does not interfere with their ability to perform their duties, including wearing a protective mask if required. It is important to note that obtaining such a waiver is not guaranteed, and the decision rests on the assessment of the relevant authorities concerning the individual's specific situation. In conclusion, barring any limited exceptions for religious accommodation, having a beard in the United States Marine Corps is generally not allowed. The strict regulations on personal appearance, including the prohibition of beards, serve to promote hygiene, ensure the proper fitting of protective gear, and uphold discipline and camaraderie among service members."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Westworld Movie plot: It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them...

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Therefore, when Pedro, the boy from a neighboring ranch that Tita has fallen in love with, comes to ask for her hand in marriage, Tita's mother Mama Elena, refuses; she instead offers her other daughter Rosaura to Pedro as his wife. Pedro accepts as the only way for him to be close to the woman he loves is to marry her sister. Tita, with the help of the old \\"Indian\\" (Native Mexican) ranch cook Nacha, bakes the wedding cake while weeping her sorrow and shedding her tears into the cake batter. The resulting cake causes a severe, crushing longing for their one true love in all those who eat it, causing vomiting, crying, and sorrow in not only the wedding guests but also in Nacha, who dies from the heartache of missing her one true love; Tita become the head ranch cook afterwards. A year later, Tita's emotions again infuse a meal that she cooks. While using the roses that Pedro has brought her to celebrate her first anniversary as the ranch cook, her burning passion for Pedro transfers to her sister Gertrudis, who, overcome with lust, attempts to cool down by taking a shower, only to be scooped up and carried off by a passing soldier. Rosaura gives birth to a baby boy, but Tita miraculously is able to nurse the child after the death of his wet nurse, and she bonds with him. However, Mama Elena is suspicious of Tita's intentions toward Pedro, and sends Rosaura and Pedro away. Tita blames the consequent death of the baby on Mama Elena and, grief-stricken, Tita falls into a catatonic-like state. Dr. John Brown, a kind and gentle widower with a young son, takes Tita away to care for her in Arkansas.

Answer:","completion":"The old \\"Indian\\" in the movie \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is Nacha, the Native Mexican ranch cook who works for the De La Garza family. Nacha is a skilled cook and mentor figure to Tita, the story's protagonist. She provides Tita with guidance and comfort in the face of the family tradition that forbids Tita to marry. As Tita is forced to care for her mother Mama Elena and forbidden to marry her true love Pedro, Nacha plays a crucial role in helping Tita navigate her tumultuous emotions. When Pedro ends up marrying Tita's sister Rosaura to be close to Tita, Nacha assists Tita in baking the wedding cake. Tita, who channels her emotions through her cooking, unintentionally infuses the cake with intense longing and sadness, leading to a disastrous effect on all who consume it. This event ultimately results in Nacha's demise due to the overwhelming heartache of missing her one true love. Nacha's passing marks a significant turning point for Tita, as she must then step up as the head ranch cook. Throughout the story, Tita's cooking continues to be a powerful outlet for her emotions, influencing those around her. In the absence of Nacha, her mentor and confidante, Tita faces new challenges as she experiences love, loss, and betrayal within her family. In summary, the old \\"Indian\\" in the movie \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is Nacha, the Native Mexican ranch cook who serves as a mentor and surrogate mother figure to the protagonist, Tita. Through their shared love of cooking and understanding of the mystical and emotional power associated with it, Nacha plays an indispensable role in Tita's journey as she struggles with the seemingly insurmountable obstacles placed in front of her by the family tradition that forbids her to marry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I've known about Bettie Page for many a year now. The soft-core porn images of her from the 1950's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today. The \\"Bettie Page\\" look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then. So I watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint. Among other things, it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like Irving Klaw, John Willie, and Bunny Yeager  all consider trailblazers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950's America along with a sexuality that, by today's standards, was innocent in the extreme. I particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie found herself in. I think that Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of Bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naiveté. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved the attention, saw nothing wrong with nudity, and enjoyed dressing up in \\"silly outfits\\" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her. To this day she still doesn't understand \\"what all the fuss was about\\" when it comes to her pictures or the S&M content of them. This isn't to say she's uneducated or too simple to understand it's just that she simply doesn't \\"get it\\" about fetishism and never will. No harm there. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The film captured this quite nicely. The social atmosphere of the 1950's depicted by Ms. Harron and written by her along with Guinevere Turner makes me truly glad I live in the day and age that I do. The hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world. The film well captures this and brings to cheering as Bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naiveté. This film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points Ms. Harron attempted and hit them well. I'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture.

The most important part of your trip to figure out is where you are going to go. Even if you already know your destination, make sure you know exactly what region or area you want to visit. If you plan to visit multiple locations, make sure you know exactly where they are and how far apart they are from each other. For instance, even if you know that you want to visit California, you can narrow down your trip to visiting San Francisco and San Jose. If you and your friends disagree on where to go, try to reach a consensus. If your parents pick up on the fact that you and your friends have different thoughts about the trip, they will be less likely to give their permission. Once you know where you're going, figure out how long your trip will take, including travel time. Make sure that you and your friends check a calendar and pick the exact dates you will be leaving and coming back. Check in with your friends about their schedules and coordinate a time that works best for everyone. Make a comprehensive day-by-day plan that details exactly where you will be throughout your trip. This is especially important if you are visiting multiple cities or countries. You need to know exactly what days you will be in each location. You also should figure out what main activity or activities you will be doing each day. For example, one day in your schedule could be: “Monday, September 12: 3rd day in Mexico City. Visit the Anthropology Museum and the Casa Azul. Eat dinner downtown.” Hear your friends out and compromise when you are planning your activities. Once you know exactly where you'll be on each day of your trip, you can start to figure out how you will get from place to place. If you are travelling a long distance, you will have to fly to your destination. Then figure out how to get from place to place based on the plans that you laid out. Note the cost of the transportation. Don't actually buy any tickets, just write down how much a ticket would cost. Figure out how where you will stay overnight for each part of the trip. Ask you friends if they know of anyone in the place you are visiting where you could stay. Also check out the prices of hotels and hostels, and write down several options. Aim to be economical, but don't stay somewhere that isn't reputable just because it's cheap. Add up the price of your transportation and lodgings. Then add the approximate amount you expect to spend per day on food and souvenirs. Add a little extra in case something comes up. This should give you a good estimate of the cost of the trip. Adding a little extra money to your budget in case of emergencies will help show your parents that you are responsible and thinking ahead. This may help convince them to let you go. Either type up or write down your itinerary. It should include everything that you have already worked on, and should be organized by day. Each day should include the main activities of the day along with the price of each hotel and method of transport. This will show your parents how much thought you put into your trip as well as give them an idea of the sorts of things you will be doing. This may help reassure them.","completion":"Before you talk to your parents about a trip, you and your friends need to make a plan together. First, decide where to go and how long the trip will be.

The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Life Cycle of a Conifer Pine trees are conifers (cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte. Therefore, they are monoecious plants. Like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. In the male cones, or staminate cones, the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis. In the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind. Some gametophytes will land on a female cone. Pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth. The pollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis. At fertilization, one of the sperm cells will finally unite its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of a haploid egg cell. Female cones, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. One megaspore mother cell, or megasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule. Three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg). Upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. Fertilization and seed development is a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination. The seed that is formed contains three generations of tissues: the seed coat that originates from the sporophyte tissue, the gametophyte that will provide nutrients, and the embryo itself. Q: Because conifers carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte, they are considered what type of plant? A: The answer is:","completion":"Conifers are considered monoecious plants because they carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The United States has become infamous for high-profile mass shootings, such as the tragedies at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival, and Stoneman Douglas High School. Each time one of these horrific incidents garners national attention, it reinvigorates the gun control debate, yet little progress is made in terms of legislative action. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution in addressing gun violence, other countries have implemented stricter gun control laws to varying degrees of success. Australia, for example, enacted the National Firearms Agreement after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. This comprehensive gun reform included a nationwide ban on semi-automatic firearms and a firearm registry, which resulted in a 65% decrease in gun-related deaths between 1995 and 2006. The United Kingdom enacted similar measures in response to the Dunblane Primary School tragedy and has since enjoyed lower overall gun-related deaths. Both countries demonstrate the potential effectiveness of legislative action in reducing gun violence. Resistance to Change: Step 6: Describe the role of gun rights activists and organizations Step 7: Discuss the influence of political polarization on the gun control debate Despite the evidence suggesting that stricter gun control laws can save lives, many Americans, particularly gun rights activists, continue to resist change. Influential organizations, such as the National Rifle Association (NRA), often advocate for the protection of Second Amendment rights and argue that more firearms lead to a safer society. This resistance to change is exacerbated by a deeply polarized political climate that leaves little room for compromise on issues like gun control. In this environment, even the most well-constructed arguments and proposed legislation can falter, leaving millions exposed to the tragic consequences of gun violence. Conclusion: Step 8: Stress the need for open dialogue and cooperation to address the issue Step 9: Emphasize the importance of acknowledging the reality of gun violence in shaping a safer future It is through open dialogue and cooperation that real progress can be made in addressing gun violence in the United States. Americans must shift the narrative away from attempting to convince each other that gun violence is, or is not, a problem. Instead, we must come to terms with the reality that tens of thousands of lives are being lost to gun violence each year and work together to find meaningful, evidence-based solutions. Only by acknowledging the risks we face can we hope to build a safer future for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Question: \\"Why did the UN Command cease fire?\\" Context: \\"In 1952, the United States elected a new president, and on 29 November 1952, the president-elect, Dwight D. Eisenhower, went to Korea to learn what might end the Korean War. With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UN Command ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th parallel. Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by the KPA and ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The UN Command ceased fire due to a combination of factors that ultimately led to the acceptance of an armistice agreement. Here are the steps to justify the answer: 1. In 1952, the United States elected a new president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was committed to finding a way to end the Korean War. 2. Eisenhower visited Korea to better understand the situation and explore possible solutions to bring about the end of the conflict. 3. During this period, India proposed a Korean War armistice which was accepted by the United Nations. The proposal provided a diplomatic pathway for the parties involved in the conflict to work towards a resolution. 4. In response to the acceptance of the armistice proposal by the UN, the Korean People's Army (KPA), the People's Volunteer Army (PVA), and the UN Command agreed to cease fire, recognizing that continuing hostilities would not be productive and could only prolong the suffering. 5. The battle line at the time of the ceasefire was approximately at the 38th parallel, serving as a de facto border between North and South Korea. 6. With the implementation of the armistice agreement, the warring parties established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has been patrolled by various forces, including the KPA, ROKA, United States, and Joint UN Commands. In conclusion, the UN Command ceased fire following the acceptance of the armistice proposal, as it provided a diplomatic solution to ending the Korean War and preventing further conflict in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax, and Norman Cantor (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of blood poisoning) and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

What is the missing first step of the following process: - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs -","completion":"The missing first step of the process is: Inhale air through your nose and/or mouth. To provide a detailed overview, here is the complete process of respiration, including the missing step: 1. Inhale air through your nose and/or mouth: When you breathe in, air enters your body through your nostrils or mouth, and begins its journey towards the lungs. 2. Air travels down the trachea: The inhaled air moves through the trachea (windpipe) and towards the bronchi. 3. Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli: The bronchi continue to branch into narrower bronchioles, eventually leading to the tiny air sacs called alveoli. This is where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. 4. Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries: Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and enters the surrounding capillaries (tiny blood vessels). 5. The oxygen goes into the bloodstream: Once inside the capillaries, the oxygen attaches to red blood cells. Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, binds to the oxygen, enabling it to be transported through the bloodstream. 6. Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up: As oxygen-rich blood circulates through the body, it drops off oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide – a waste product of cellular respiration. 7. Carbon dioxide moves back to the lungs: The carbon dioxide travels in the bloodstream back to the lungs, where it passes from the capillaries to the alveoli. 8. You breathe it out through your lungs: As you exhale, the carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled from your lungs and out of your body through your nose and/or mouth, and the process starts again with the next inhalation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"\\"In viitor, locurile de muncă din sectorul social trebuie să fie mai bine plătite.\\" This sentence translates to \\"In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid.\\" in Romanian. The structure of the sentence is relatively similar to the English version, but with slight variations to accommodate the Romanian language grammar and syntax rules. A breakdown of the translation is as follows: 1. \\"In viitor\\" - \\"In future\\" \\"In\\" remains the same as it functions as a preposition in both languages. \\"Viitor\\" means future in Romanian and is derived from the Latin word \\"futurus\\" that denotes future in a more general sense. 2. \\"locurile de muncă\\" - \\"jobs\\" \\"Locuri\\" means places, and \\"de muncă\\" translates to \\"of work.\\" Combined, this phrase refers to job positions or work opportunities. The Romanian language uses the definite article \\"le\\" for plural, which is added to the end of the noun as a suffix to form \\"locurile.\\" 3. \\"din\\" - \\"in\\" \\"Din\\" serves as a preposition meaning \\"from\\" or \\"out of\\" but is used in this context to reflect \\"in\\" as it relates to job positions coming from the social sector. 4. \\"sectorul social\\" - \\"the social sector\\" \\"Sectorul\\" refers to \\"the sector,\\" while \\"social\\" remains the same in both languages, derived from Latin and used for addressing social issues. The combination of these two words represents the social sector more broadly. 5. \\"trebuie\\" - \\"must\\" \\"Trebuie\\" translates to \\"must\\" or \\"need to\\" in Romanian. It implies necessity or a requirement in this context. 6. \\"să fie\\" - \\"to be\\" \\"Să\\" and \\"fie\\" function together to form the verb \\"to be\\" in the subjunctive mood, which is necessary when expressing possibility, obligation, or desire. 7. \\"mai bine\\" - \\"better\\" \\"Mai\\" means \\"more,\\" while \\"bine\\" translates to \\"well\\" or \\"good.\\" Paired together, \\"mai bine\\" means that something is superior or better in comparison to a previous state. 8. \\"plătite\\" - \\"paid\\" \\"Plătite\\" is the plural form of the past passive participle of the verb \\"a plăti\\" (to pay). In this context, it refers to the act of someone being paid for their work. As such, the translation of \\"In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid.\\" in Romanian is \\"In viitor, locurile de muncă din sectorul social trebuie să fie mai bine plătite.\\" This statement emphasizes the necessity to improve the financial compensation for jobs within the social sector in the future, mirroring the sentiment of the original English sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Hundreds of mourners, many wearing orange ribbons, filled a western Michigan church Tuesday for the funeral of a 16-year-old star athlete who collapsed and died after scoring a winning basket for his high school team. The funeral for Wes Leonard was held less than a day after his Fennville High teammates shed their grief for a few hours and won the first game of the state basketball playoffs in front of 3,500 fans. Leonard died of an enlarged heart last Thursday, moments after his shot gave the undefeated Blackhawks another victory. At Christ Memorial Church, the Rev. Gary Peterson opened the service with a prayer and recalled Leonard's love for sports, the outdoors and his Christian faith. Orange is a school color, and orange flowers and ribbons were everywhere. Since last week, Peterson, pastor of Fennville United Methodist Church, said many teenagers have told him about Leonard's love for Jesus. \\"Wes walked the talk. ... He was a man of action. He stood behind those words,\\" Peterson said. Jim Leonard said his nephew was \\"larger than life.\\" \\"I never used or understood that clichDe until the last four days,\\" the uncle said. Other schools shared Fennville's grief. A bus carrying more than 70 students from the Gobles and Bloomingdale districts arrived at the funeral. Classes were canceled in the Fennville district. \\"We just didn't want anyone to feel conflicted about whether they should be at school or here,\\" Superintendent Dirk Weeldreyer said of the funeral. \\"We just felt it was important to be able to show our caring and concern for the family.\\" Fennville is a town of about 1,400, but the school district covers a broader area in southwest Michigan near Lake Michigan. Leonard's absence overshadowed the Monday night game, which was moved to Hope College in Holland to accommodate a larger crowd. After the final buzzer sounded, his teammates hugged and cried. \\"I think he was watching down on us,\\" Fennville coach Ryan Klingler said after the 65-54 win over Lawrence. \\"This is a game he'd have liked.\\" In tribute to Leonard, Fennville sent just four players onto the court before the opening tip. The fifth player took the court after a dramatic pause to wild cheering from the crowd. Some players flashed Leonard's jersey number, \\"35\\" -- holding up three fingers on one hand and five on the other -- at moments before and during the game. Fans held up signs with such phrases as \\"We love Wes\\" or had his number painted on their faces in the team's colors, black and orange. During pregame warm-ups, players from both teams wore black T-shirts with Leonard's name and number on the back and the phrase \\"Never Forgotten\\" on the front. Players also wore black wristbands with Leonard's initials on them. The first standing ovation came as Fennville players stoically walked onto the court for pregame warm-ups, joined by Leonard's younger brother, Mitchell. The crowd again came to its feet and clapped as more members of the Leonard family, including his parents, entered DeVos Fieldhouse. A moment of silence was held for Leonard, who also was the quarterback on the school's football team. His uncle, Jim Leonard, said the family is overwhelmed at the support it's received. Monday's game was the first for Fennville since Thursday, when Leonard made the game-winning basket in overtime on his home court against Bridgman to cap an undefeated regular season at 20-0. Teams shook hands after the game and Leonard was lifted off the floor in celebration, a wide grin on his face. Seconds later, he fell to the court. Leonard was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy by the Ottawa County medical examiner showed he died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart. The team's second Class C district game is scheduled for Wednesday. Fennville's decision to play Monday came after school officials talked to Leonard's family. While some fans and school officials had talked before the game about how it wouldn't really matter who won, Fennville players didn't seem to have that attitude -- rallying to victory after falling behind early. \\"Wes would have wanted to win,\\" said Adam Siegel, a teammate of Leonard's. \\"I wanted to win. ...

Answer the following question: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. Which country will feel the effects of climate change more drastically? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's evaluate the factors and reasoning step by step: 1. The Arctic has been a significant place for climate change research due to its high latitude and sensitivity to temperature changes. The effects of climate change are predicted to manifest more quickly and drastically in higher latitudes, such as Northwest Canada and Alaska. 2. From an anthropological perspective, the Inuit peoples of Alaska are studied as they adapt to ecological and climate variability, highlighting the importance of understanding the changes in this region. 3. Iceland and Ecuador are the two countries mentioned that we need to compare. Iceland is located at a higher latitude, closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is near the Equator. Given the information provided, it can be concluded that Iceland, being at a higher latitude and closer to the Arctic, will likely feel the effects of climate change more drastically compared to Ecuador. This is because higher latitude regions are more sensitive to temperature changes and are expected to experience more significant impacts from climate change."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Process: - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest - The bird makes its own nest.

Summarize this article: The teenage children of one of the victims of the shooting at a church in Charleston, say they've forgiven their mother's killer. Speaking for the first time since the attacks, they told the BBC they wanted to focus on moving on in a positive way. Their mother, Sharonda Singleton, 45, was one of nine people shot dead. Suspect Dylann Roof, 21, is now in custody. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Charleston, South Carolina. ||||| CHARLESTON — Sharonda Coleman-Singleton’s friends threw her a big party Thursday night. She was there only in spirit. The high school speech therapist and women’s track and field coach was one of nine people shot to death Wednesday night in the basement of a church in downtown Charleston, S.C. Coleman-Singleton, 45, was at a Bible study at Emanuel A.M.E. Church when 21-year-old Dylann Roof allegedly opened fire on the pastor and other congregants Remembering the Victims of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church (PHOTOS) Less than 24 hours later, friends, colleagues, and students of Coleman-Singleton filled the gymnasium of Goose Creek High School outside Charleston to honor the schoolteacher’s legacy. The vigil featured spirited gospel music and emotional tributes from school administrators and fellow coaches. At times, there seemed to be hardly a dry eye in the house. Among those mourning Coleman-Singleton was Joe Hauff, the men’s track coach at Goose Creek High. Over the years, Hauff said, the two spent countless hours together, most of them at track meets. Their lives off the track were also similar. They had kids the same age and shared a mutual passion for athletics. Each struggled with the challenge of raising children while also finding time to teach and coach. Coleman-Singleton, Hauff notes, did all that as a single parent, too. “She’s got three great kids,” Hauff said, “but she had to work at it.” When it came to track and field, Hauff said he enlightened Coleman-Singleton about some of the finer, technical aspects of the sport. But “she taught me a lot more,” he noted. Specifically, he said, “in how to handle the adversity of a teenager.” Coleman-Singleton’s track athletes expressed a similar admiration for their coach.

She always saw greatness in us no matter what,” said Kamryn Simmons, a high school junior on the women’s track and field team. “She always had a smile on her face, even when she was yelling at us.” Simmons’s twin sister, Alexis, recalled how Coleman-Singleton would run beside her athletes to motivate them, referring to the maneuver as “cheek to cheek.” Children seemed to occupy the center of Coleman-Singleton’s universe. Many students and faculty at Goose Creek High remember her as a woman willing to help anyone in need, whether or not she was their teacher or coach. “She was always fighting for her kids,” said Goose Creek High principal Jimmy Huskey, who has worked at the school for 27 years. “She was a bulldog for her children.” As the vigil came to a close, as the gospel music faded and the gymnasium began to empty, Coleman-Singleton’s oldest son walked out with his sister and friends, headed for a memorial created beside the school’s track and football stadium. Chris Singleton, a baseball player at Charleston Southern University, carried a flower in his hand as he remembered his mother. He had last spoken to her by phone when she was at Bible study, asking her where she had hidden the remote control in the house. In the closet, she whispered to him, so his younger brother would not play too many video games. Charleston Church Shooting Aftermath (PHOTOS) They hung up, oblivious to the tragedy that was soon to unfold. Moments later, the gunman, who had allegedly sat with his victims as they prayed, began his rampage. Despite the tragedy, Chris Singleton was stoic Thursday evening as he spoke about his mother. “She was a great coach, she was an even better mother,” he said. “She smiled 24/7. That was her trademark.” Stopping before a picture of his mother near the track, he placed the flower on her memorial while a small crowd looked on. The sun had just set, and all was silent. No one had anything left to say. ||||| Sharonda Coleman-Singleton with her son Chris Singleton, a Charleston Southern baseball player, on his senior night during basketball season at Goose Creek High School. File Mother, teacher, coach, minister — Sharonda Coleman-Singleton did all of it, and with a smile and a style those who knew her will not soon forget. “She always had a smile on her face ... an awesome smile,” said one colleague at Goose Creek High School. “When she came to games, you knew she was there,” said Goose Creek Principal Jimmy Huskey. “She was going to be yelling and screaming for the Gators, and she loved Goose Creek High School.” Coleman-Singleton, 45, was one of nine people killed Wednesday night in the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. She was a minister on staff at the historic church, a role she fulfilled on top of her duties as a speech pathologist and girls track and field coach at Goose Creek High. But the most important role she played was as the mother of three children, including her oldest, Charleston Southern sophomore baseball player Chris Singleton. “She loved baseball and loved Chris,” Goose Creek baseball coach Chris Pond said. “She loved everyone and always had a positive attitude about everything.” Coleman-Singleton ran track herself, at South Carolina State University, where she helped her team to a conference championship and earned a degree in speech pathology and audiology in 1991. A member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, she also earned a master’s degree from Montclair State in her native New Jersey. She worked in school districts in Georgia before joining the Berkeley County School District in 2007, working first at Stratford and for the last eight years at Goose Creek. She earned a reputation at the latter as a fierce advocate for her students. “She was a bulldog when it came to her kids,” an emotional Huskey said Thursday. “She cared about her kids. She was a true team player, but she always wanted more for her kids, and I admired her for that.” As the Gators’ track coach, Coleman-Singleton attended to more than her athletes’ technique and times. “It’s 95 degrees out there, and she’s with those girls every day,” Huskey said. “She taught those young ladies how to be better young ladies, and that can never be replaced.” Coleman-Singleton’s older son, Chris, was a two-sport star at Goose Creek, playing baseball and basketball. She called him “Lil Chris” and sat proudly by his side on the day he signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Charleston Southern. On Chris’ senior night during basketball season, Coleman-Singleton carried a single yellow rose in her left hand, her right arm through her son’s. She was smiling. “She was a wonderful parent, very involved,” said former Goose Creek athletic director Chuck Reedy. “She was one of those people a lot of people looked up to and tried to emulate.” Her son Chris posted this Thursday on Instagram: “You were a better mother than I could have ever asked for. This has truly broken my heart in every way possible.” Jeff Hartsell ||||| Summary:","completion":"The teenage children of Sharonda Singleton, one of the victims of the shooting at a church in Charleston, have said they've forgiven their mother's killer.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What type of instrument did McBurney point out was a haunting sound that punctuated the Kije music? Despite his lack of experience in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: \\"I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film\\". He told the producers, \\"What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero\\", and warned them not to expect mere musical \\"illustrations\\". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show \\"the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century\\". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the \\"haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone\\" that punctuate the Kijé music.The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's \\"unfailingly witty and melodious score\\". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or leitmotifs which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as \\"well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era\\". A:","completion":"The type of instrument that McBurney pointed out as producing a haunting sound that punctuated the Kijé music is the tenor saxophone. Prokofiev, the composer of the Kijé score, was inspired by the use of saxophone in Ravel's Boléro, which he heard in Paris. The saxophone was an instrument rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France at that time, but it perfectly suited Prokofiev's intentions in creating the desired atmosphere for the music.

Backstage, city official \\"The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson\\" reinforces the city's commitment to reason (here meaning uniformity) by ordering the execution of a soldier (Sting in a cameo) who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery, claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers. Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theatre company and Jackson, the \\"real\\" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold, the world's fastest runner; Adolphus, a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus, who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and the fantastically strong Albrecht. When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, Jackson cancels the acting troupe's contract because of the Baron. The Baron wanders backstage, where the Angel of Death tries to take his life, but Sally Salt, the young daughter of the theater company's leader, saves him and persuades him to remain living. Sally races to the wall yelling for the Turkish army to go away, and the Baron accidentally fires himself through the sky using a mortar and returns riding a cannonball, narrowly escaping the Angel of Death once again. Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes over the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. The balloon...

Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve - Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process described is the weathering and erosion of parent rocks. The detailed process can be broken down as follows: 1. Weathering and Erosion of Parent Rocks: The process begins with the weathering of parent rocks, which are the original solid materials that serve as a source of the sediment. Parent rocks can be igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary in origin. Weathering involves the physical and chemical breakdown of these rocks into smaller particles through processes like freezing and thawing, temperature fluctuations, and the action of water, wind, and biological organisms. Erosion then transports these smaller particles, such as pebbles, sand, silt, or clay, away from the parent rock and deposits them elsewhere. 2. Transportation and Deposition of Sediment: The wind or water transports these tiny rocks and deposits them in various environments like rivers, lakes, oceans, or deserts. This process of sediment transportation and deposition continues over time, eventually leading to the accumulation of layers of particulate material. 3. Formation of Sedimentary Layers: As the deposited sediment begins to accumulate, the layers start to build upon each other. The weight of the upper layers puts pressure on the lower layers, pressing them together. This process is called compaction, and it reduces the pore space between the sediment particles. It eventually results in sediment layers that are firmly packed together. 4. Mineral Dissolution and Cementation: As the layers of sediment continue to press together, the minerals contained within them are subject to dissolution. Groundwater that percolates through the sediment layers dissolves these minerals, which are then precipitated in the spaces between the sediment particles. This precipitation, or cementation, effectively glues the sediment together, creating a solid rock known as a sedimentary rock. 5. Formation of Sedimentary Rock: Once cementation has occurred, the layers of sediment are now a single rock, referred to as a sedimentary rock. This entire process is called lithification. The resulting sedimentary rock can consist of various types of minerals, textures, and structures, depending on the parent rock, depositional environment, and the nature of the cementing minerals. Examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale. In summary, the missing first step in the process you provided is the weathering and erosion of parent rocks, which generate the sediment that is then transported, deposited, compacted, and cemented to form sedimentary rock."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: World Kate and Gerry McCann hold an age-progressed police image of their daughter during a news conference to mark the 5th anniversary of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, on May 2, 2012. Photo: Getty New Zealand police have obtained a DNA sample from a young girl people had thought to be Madeleine McCann, at the request of Scotland Yard. The request follows a New Year's Eve sighting of the girl in Queenstown. It was not the first time her striking resemblance to the missing young British girl had been reported to police. Detective Senior Sergeant Kallum Croudis, of Dunedin, confirmed police would be sending a DNA profile of the girl to British police investigating Madeleine's disappearance. \\"Police will be sending a DNA profile to British police . . . to confirm the identity of a girl who has been mistaken for Madeleine by a member of the public,\\" Mr Croudis said. DNA sampling was a conclusive way to establish identity, he said. The DNA profile was given voluntarily to police. The results of the test are not expected to be available for weeks. \\"The results of this process will not be known for some time,\\" he said. Madeleine McCann went missing from the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2007 just before her fourth birthday. She was on holiday with her parents Kate and Gerry and siblings Sean and Amelie. Queenstown hit international headlines after a retailer reported serving a man, and a girl who bore a striking resemblance to the missing Madeleine, on New Year's Eve. The sighting sparked a five-day police investigation. On January 4, Queenstown police issued a statement saying they had identified the girl seen in Queenstown and were \\"absolutely satisfied' she was not Madeleine. Detective Sergeant Brian Cameron declined to disclose any details about the identified child, stating only that this was not the first occasion someone had contacted police remarking on the similarity between the two girls. At the time, Mr Cameron would not disclose the methods used by police to identify the child. It is not the first time a child has been DNA-tested in relation to the case of the missing British girl. In 2011, a young girl spotted in India with a Belgian man and French woman was tested and was also found not to be Madeleine. A spokeswoman at the British High Commission in Wellington would not comment and said all matters relating to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann should be directed through the commission's London office. stuff.co.nz ||||| British police have asked for a DNA sample from a girl in New Zealand said to bear a striking resemblance to the missing British girl. Hugo Correia / REUTERS A billboard of Madeleine McCann is seen at Praia da Luz, April 5, 2009 British police have asked for a DNA sample from a girl in New Zealand said to bear a striking resemblance to the missing British girl Madeleine McCann. The girl, who was spotted on New Year’s Eve in a store in the South Island city of Queenstown, had the same blemish on her eye — a coloboma of the iris, which occurs in only about 0.007% of the population — as Madeleine, reports national broadcaster TVNZ. “She had the same eye defect as Madeleine. Only a very small percentage of the population have that and I was just staring at it the whole time to the point I forgot what they had purchased,” said the store owner who reported the sighting, reports the Daily Telegraph. (MORE: Is Madeleine McCann Still Alive?) But the Mirror reports that police in New Zealand insist that it’s a case of mistaken identity. “Police will be sending a DNA profile to British police . . . to confirm the identity of a girl who has been mistaken for Madeleine by a member of the public,” said Detective Senior Sergeant Kallum Croudis, reports the Telegraph. He said the girl has been mistaken for Madeleine more than once, as TVNZ reports. (MORE: A Child is Rescued in Philadelphia. But Why Was Her Abduction So Easy?) British police said that the alleged sighting is not a line of inquiry and it has asked for the sample to confirm that the girl is not Madeleine. According to 3News, the results of the DNA test won’t be available for weeks. Madeleine was nearly four years old when she disappeared from her family’s rented holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on 3 May 2007, while her parents had dinner at a nearby restaurant. Since then there have been numerous “sightings” of Madeleine across the globe. As well as several more in New Zealand, there have been reported sightings in India, Morocco and Brazil. MORE: Madeleine McCann, One Year Later ||||| New Zealand “Maddie�? sightings prompt authorities to request a DNA sample from a young girl with similar markings to the abducted tot. Whenever someone calls the Queenstown, New Zealand, police to report that they’ve seen a little girl who looks just like Madeleine McCann, the 4-year-old Briton who disappeared from her parents’ holiday villa in Portugal the night of May 3, 2007, police know exactly whom they are talking about. They’ve been called to investigate a Maddie sighting five times in the last five years in the cities of Queenstown, Milton, and Alexandra, and each time they are led to the same young child, who not only shares McCann’s hair coloring and petite stature, but also has the same coloboma in her right eye. The last sighting was New Year’s Eve, when a store clerk in Queenstown reported that a peculiar man came into the store where she worked with a shy young girl who looked “just like Madeleine.�? The police went on a five-day manhunt to chase down the little girl, whose parents are transient. New Zealand Detective Sgt. Brian Cameron issued a statement January 4 that police were “absolutely satisfied�? that the young girl was not the missing Briton. “This was not the first occasion that someone had contacted the police remarking on the similarity between the two girls.�? But Scotland Yard wants to be sure. As part of the ongoing McCann case review called Operation Grange, which kicked off in May 2011, Metropolitan police want to test the New Zealand child’s DNA to make sure once and for all that she is not McCann. The DNA request has been accepted, but it will take several weeks before test results are complete and the young girl can be completely ruled out as a match. Operation Grange, which has cost more than 4 million, according to British press reports, will be the definitive read on the case. Under the direction of Scotland Yard, homicide and child-kidnapping specialists are reviewing some 100,000 pages of documents, which contain more than 40,000 pieces of evidence used in the original investigation by Portuguese police. They are also following up on each new lead in the case, including the New Zealand sightings. On January 24, 2013, an English-language newspaper in Portugal reported that an investigative team from Scotland Yard had flown back to Portugal to follow up on several leads. They are meeting with Helena Monteiro, a new Portuguese investigator who was not involved in the original investigation and is reportedly considering reopening the case based on Scotland Yard’s finding of 200 lost threads in the investigation. Many of the forgotten leads deal with reports of active child-trafficking rings during the time McCann disappeared, with reports that children were being “stolen to order�? across the region. In one case, several guests at the holiday resort reported seeing a strange man carrying a small child under a blanket late the night she disappeared. The Portuguese authorities at the time never followed up on the sighting, according to Met police familiar with the Operation Grange dossier. Instead Portuguese police almost immediately suspected McCann’s parents, Kate and Gerry, and relentlessly pursued them as suspects during the weeks after the disappearance, often ignoring other leads. The couple had left young Madeleine and her twin siblings alone in the holiday villa while they dined at a nearby tapas bar a few hundred yards away on the resort grounds. The McCanns and their friends took turns checking on the children in half-hour increments, a move that would have given potential abductors an easy window to come in and swipe the child. Had they not been so precise and instead checked the children more randomly, the alleged kidnapping may have been averted. Finding no solid evidence tying the McCanns to the kidnapping, the Portuguese police cleared them and closed the case in July 2008. But after a strong campaign by McCann supporters, British Prime Minister David Cameron opened the investigation and launched Operation Grange. So far the review has definitively closed many conspiracy theories in the case, but it has also renewed speculation that McCann may still be alive. Last year Scotland Yard has reviewed long-forgotten leads in Spain after a Gibraltar resident said she had reported seeing a young British girl with a German family at a Spanish campground in the days after the disappearance. The lead was never followed by the Portuguese cops, despite efforts by the woman who spotted the young girl. Other leads, including ties to a known pedophile, Raymond Hewlett, who was living in Portugal at the time and wrote a deathbed letter confessing he knew what happened to the young girl, were ignored and may never be laid to rest. Still, with every new sighting and the discovery of another old lead, McCann’s parents renew hope that they will find their daughter alive. ||||| Summary:","completion":"New Zealand police have obtained a DNA sample from a young girl who bears a striking resemblance to British girl Madeleine McCann, who went missing in 2007.

Once upon a time in Wales, there was a big group of people called the council. They were in charge of many services that helped everyone in the community, like fixing roads, taking care of parks, and helping people who needed extra support. The council uses money that everyone in the community pays, called taxes, to keep those services running and make sure everyone is happy and safe. However, the council discovered they didn't have enough money to keep all of these services running as well as they wanted. So they came up with an idea! They thought about asking other groups of people, like your neighbors and friends, to help manage these services. We call these groups voluntary and community groups because they help for free and care about their community. Some people think this is a great idea because it lets everyone work together to take care of their town. Other people are not so sure because they wonder if the voluntary and community groups can do as good a job as the council. They worry that the services might not be the same or that it might be too hard for these groups to handle. There is a special group in Wales called the \\"spending watchdog,\\" which keeps an eye on how money is spent, especially the tax money from the community. The spending watchdog is worried about whether the council's idea will work. The spending watchdog says they are not sure if the voluntary and community groups can take care of all the important council-run services because it is a big job. They are warning that it might be difficult for these groups to manage everything. So now, the council, the voluntary and community groups, and the spending watchdog all need to talk and think about whether this idea is the best way to help the community. They will try to find the best answer to make sure everyone in Wales is happy, safe, and well cared for. In the end, we will all have to wait and see if this new idea of community groups helping with council services will be a fairy tale ending or not.

Ford Island continues to be used by the US Navy. It hosts the 34,000-square-foot (3,200 m2) Pacific Warfighting Center for exercises, training and battle simulations. The Admiral Clarey Bridge enabled the Navy to develop a 331 million Pacific tsunami warning center named after Senator Daniel Inouye, replacing the aging facility on ʻEwa Beach. The center's location is controversial because of its location in a tsunami-vulnerable area and the Navy's tsunami-evacuation plan calls for the island's only access point—the Admiral Clarey Bridge—to be opened for ship evacuation (making the bridge inaccessible to land vehicles). The island also continues to host a military brig.Nominally based in Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for maintenance and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly 1,000,000,000, has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.In 2013, the Navy unveiled a 4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport on Ford Island.

Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum, he debuted in the comic book Giant-Size X-Men #1 (May 1975). Nightcrawler is a member of a fictional subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman agility, the ability to teleport, and adhesive hands and feet. In the 2008 miniseries X-Infernus, Pixie summons her Souldagger and stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removes her Souldagger, Magik's Soulsword emerges from his chest. Magik teleports away after taking out Pixie, Mercury, Rockslide, and Beast. Kurt wakes up and stops Pixie from going after her and Pixie breaks down and apologizes for stabbing him. Later the X-Men gather and Kurt is put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik. Upon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fight their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her Souldagger. Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar and she asks him to stab her with Pixie's Souldagger, as it's the only way and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic.He apologizes and he stabs her; at that moment Colossus punches Kurt, and Witchfire finishes making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie. The fact however that Colossus and Wolverine have not killed him, makes Kurt realize they are not fully under her control. Using Pixie's Dagger, Kurt then pulls Illyana's Soulsword from her, and uses it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire's control. Unfortunately, the demon manages to use the Bloodstones to summon the Elder Gods. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie flees. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoles Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleports them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinces her to stay with them and join the X-Men.

Select the topic that this about: Michigan State looked like a bunch of shamrocks in their green jerseys, pants and helmets, but it couldn #39;t take the luck of the Irish away from Notre Dame Saturday night in Spartan Stadium.","completion":"The topic of discussion here is a college football game between Michigan State and Notre Dame, involving aspects of both team uniforms and game outcomes. This match-up showcases two storied and competitive football programs, and the game played on that particular Saturday night at Spartan Stadium featured some interesting twists. First, let's address the mention of Michigan State's green jerseys, pants, and helmets, which resemble a \\"bunch of shamrocks.\\" The shamrock reference is likely an allusion to Notre Dame's Fighting Irish mascot and its close association with Irish imagery. The color green is popularly tied to Irish themes, such as St. Patrick's Day and the shamrock, which has long been a symbol of good fortune. Although both teams typically sport green uniforms, Michigan State's choice to wear this vibrant color throughout their attire was a visually striking departure from their usual white pants. However, the luck associated with the Irish imagery seemingly never transferred to the Michigan State team. Notre Dame's football team managed to outshine and outperform them on that Saturday night at Spartan Stadium. This suggests that simply adopting a rival's symbolic color and imagery did not bring any particular fortune or advantage to Michigan State, even when competing in their own territory. With the stage set, one could delve into various aspects of the game's development. Factors like team strategies, individual athletic prowess, and coaching styles might have come into play as the drama unfolded on the gridiron. While the element of rivalry brought heightened emotions and intensity to the field, both squads must have been aware that it would take more than superstition or symbolism to win the night. In addition to game performance, it can be interesting to consider how a college matchup like this affects the communities and cultures surrounding both institutions. Games between rivals often generate a buzz among student bodies and alumni, spurring conversation, friendships, and new connections. The emotional investment of fans might deepen through interaction with peers or social media coverage. These events serve as important social gatherings and bonding experiences that extend beyond the outcomes of the game itself. Moreover, this particular college football game showcases the blend of sports, tradition, and folklore symbolism in a uniquely American setting. The mixing of colors, motives, and mascots from both competing teams displays how such contests often result in both visual and symbolic syntheses. In this sense, the Notre Dame versus Michigan State battle transcends the football realm, becoming a sort of cultural symbol in its own right. In summary, the topic focuses on a college football game between Michigan State and Notre Dame, highlighting both the unique aspects of team uniforms and the game's outcome. The vibrant green attire of Michigan State bore little impact on the luck of the game, as the Notre Dame team outplayed them in Spartan Stadium. A thorough analysis of this match-up would involve discussions of team strategies, individual players, the cultural implications of rivalry games, and the social interactions it fosters. Ultimately, contests like this embody a blend of sportsmanship, tradition, and symbolism that gives college football its lasting appeal and impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition? Hint: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, the parcel of land with faster rates of decomposition would be Bill's grassland-covered land. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph mentions that soil is well developed in the forest, as suggested by thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. The presence of these factors in Tom's forested land implies that there are slower rates of decomposition. 2. The process of podzolization, which occurs in forested land, leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. This process involves slow rates of decomposition, leading to large amounts of fulvic acid and the leaching of Mg, Fe, and Al. This further supports the claim that Tom's forested land has slower rates of decomposition. 3. Since we are given information on Tom's forested land, we can infer that Bill's grassland-covered land has different characteristics. As the forested land has slow rates of decomposition, it stands to reason that the grassland-covered land, which is not described as having the same characteristics, would have faster rates of decomposition in comparison. Therefore, Bill's grassland-covered land has soil with faster rates of decomposition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Grimes implies 'numerous' producers have demanded sex from her Grimes has said she has been pestered for sex by male producers. The Canadian artist, whose real name is Claire Boucher, was asked by Rolling Stone for her opinions on Kesha’s lawsuit against her producer/label boss, Dr Luke, whom she has accused of rape, and responded by saying male producers commonly expect sex. “I don’t know enough about the specifics of that situation, because it seems very complicated,” Grimes said. “But I will say that I’ve been in numerous situations where male producers would literally be like, ‘We won’t finish the song unless you come back to my hotel room.’ If I was younger or in a more financially desperate situation, maybe I would have done that. I don’t think there are few female producers because women aren’t interested. It’s difficult for women to get in. It’s a pretty hostile environment.” Related: Grimes: 'In my life, I'm a lot more weird than this' Grimes has spoken before about the sexism of the production side of the music industry. Last year she told the Fader she was angered by the failure of many music business people to recognise that she was in charge in the studio, rather than only being a performer. “The thing that I hate about the music industry is all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Grimes is a female musician’ and, ‘Grimes has a girly voice.’ It’s like, yeah, but I’m a producer and I spend all day looking at fucking graphs and EQs and doing really technical work,” she said. In October, speaking to the Guardian, she called out the London collective PC Music. “It’s really fucked up to call yourself Sophie and pretend you’re a girl when you’re a male producer [and] there are so few female producers,” she said. She has also said that female artists find credit for their work is taken away when they work with men in the studio. “If I use an engineer, then people start being like, ‘Oh! That guy just did it all,’” she told the New Yorker. “It’s a mostly male perspective – you’re mostly hearing male voices run through female performers. I think some really good art comes of it, but half the population is not really being heard.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Grimes, a Canadian artist, revealed that she has been pestered for sex by male producers numerous times throughout her career. She shared her experiences while discussing her opinion on Kesha's lawsuit against her producer, Dr. Luke, whom Kesha accused of rape. 2. Grimes believes that there aren’t fewer female producers because of a lack of interest, but rather because it is a difficult and hostile environment for women to break into. She emphasized that if she had been younger or in a more financially desperate situation, she might have succumbed to the demands of male producers. 3. The artist has previously spoken about the sexism of the music industry. Grimes mentioned that she is often not recognized for her technical work as a producer, as many people in the music business only see her as a female musician with a girly voice. 4. Grimes also called out the London collective PC Music for pretending to be female producers, as she believes it's disrespectful considering there are so few female producers in the industry. 5. Grimes underlined the fact that female artists often lose credit for their work when they collaborate with men in the studio. She specifically mentioned experiences where male engineers received all the credit even when she contributed significantly to a project. In summary, the article highlights Canadian artist Grimes' experiences with sexism in the music industry, her opinions on the difficulties faced by female producers trying to break into a male-dominated field, and her desire for equal recognition for her work."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English English:","completion":"This has become evident in the case of the oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico, a large ocean basin shared by the United States and Mexico, has been a significant source of oil and natural gas for decades. The region hosts numerous offshore oil drilling operations that are critical to the global energy market. However, recent developments and challenges, including environmental concerns, regulatory issues, and technological advancements, have brought to light the complexities of maintaining a sustainable and responsible industry in this area. In recent years, the oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico has encountered several challenges that have highlighted the inherent risks and potential issues that stem from extracting valuable resources from beneath the ocean floor. Some of these challenges include: 1. Environmental concerns: The devastating 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which resulted from an explosion on a drilling rig operated by BP, is well-known for its adverse environmental impact. The spill caused widespread damage to marine and coastal ecosystems, as well as human health and the economy of the Gulf region. This tragic event has amplified the imperative for strict regulations and policies aimed at protecting the environment and preventing such disasters in the future. 2. Regulatory issues: In response to the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, government regulators in the United States have implemented stricter regulations and oversight of offshore drilling operations. These new measures are meant to reduce the likelihood of incidents and improve safety standards to protect both the environment and the workers involved. While these regulations have been successful in reducing large-scale accidents, they have also increased the financial burden on the oil and gas industry, which may limit exploration and production in the area. 3. Technological advancements: As the global demand for oil and natural gas continues to grow, companies in the Gulf of Mexico are investing in new technology that enables them to access previously untapped reserves. This includes advancements in deepwater drilling and seismic imaging, which allow operators to explore and develop resources in deep, challenging areas. While these technologies present new opportunities, they also come with increased risk and uncertainty associated with extracting resources from such extreme depths and conditions. Despite these challenges, the Gulf of Mexico remains an essential oil and gas production hub that delivers significant economic benefits to both the United States and Mexico. Companies operating in this region must navigate a delicate balance of optimizing the extraction of valuable resources while maintaining a focus on environmental protection and safety. As the industry continues to evolve, the spotlight on these complex issues will remain an important consideration not only in the Gulf of Mexico but across the global oil and gas industry."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"How might a bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit?\\" is in \\"Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour.

Information: - The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990, and remains in operation. Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. - The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way. The estimates for its location range from 7.6 to 8.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 to 28,000 lightyears) from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius where the Milky Way appears brightest. There is strong evidence consistent with the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. - WR 102ka , also known as the Peony star , is a Wolf - Rayet star that is one of several candidates for the most luminous known star in the Milky Way . An even more luminous yet closer star , WR 25 , appears to be most likely to the title . Another nearer star Eta Carinae , which was the second brightest star in the sky for a few years in the 19th century , appears to be slightly more luminous than WR 102ka , but is known to be a binary star system . There is also the more recently discovered Pistol star that , like the Peony star , derives its name from the shape of the nebula in which it is embedded , and which it has probably created through heavy mass loss via fierce stellar winds and perhaps also major \`\` mini-supernova - like '' eruptions as happened to Eta Carinae around the 1830s - 1840s creating the lobes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope . The luminosities of the Pistol Star , Eta Carinae , and WR 102ka are all rendered somewhat uncertain due to heavy obscuration by galactic dust in the foreground , the effects of which must be corrected for before their apparent brightness can be reduced to estimate their total radiated power or bolometric luminosity . Both Eta Carinae and WR 102ka are believed likely to explode as supernovas or hypernovas within the next few million years . As is typical of such extremely massive and luminous stars , both have expelled a considerable portion of their initial mass , when originally formed , in dense , massive stellar winds . As WR 102ka lies near the Galactic Center , it is the more distant and heavily obscured of the two , and is essentially totally obscured in visible wavelengths . Thus it must be observed in longer wavelength infrared light , which is able to penetrate the dust . The Spitzer Space Telescope observed WR 102ka at wavelengths of 3.6 µm , 8 µm , and 24 µm on April 20 , 2005 . The observations were carried out by L. Oskinova , W. - R. Hamann , and A. Barniske of Potsdam University , Germany . WR 102ka was previously observed by the Two Micron All... - Eta Carinae (abbreviated to Carinae or Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N. - The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous known in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light. - The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. The nebula was named in the 1980s for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time. The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way. - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes).

Setting realistic timelines and prioritizing safety has always been the utmost focus for NASA. This is evident from their postponement of the Discovery's launch as the space agency seeks to ensure a seamless mission execution, evident in their prudent call concerning the shuttle's main engine valve. A single malfunctioning component could present various threats to the entire mission, putting the astronauts at risk, hence the delay in order to thoroughly scrutinize the suspected valve. Ever since the conception of the International Space Station, Discovery has played a pivotal role in its sustenance and incremental development. The upcoming launch presents not just another routine mission but will serve as the cap to the Discovery's multiple visits to the ISS as it delivers the final set of solar arrays for the station. These solar arrays are anticipated to amplify the power generation capabilities of the station and lend a hand in fulfilling many more scientific investigations and technological demonstrations. The 28th mission holds a unique standing for the Discovery shuttle. Each journey made by the shuttle adds another chapter to the illustrious legacy of man's exploration of outer space. Every detail, from the take-off from Kennedy Space Centre to the rendezvous with ISS, is precisely calculated, bearing the stamp of man's excellence in science and technology. Preparations are underway as the space agency combines its efforts to resolve the valve concerns and ensure a safe and successful mission. While the stakes are high, it remains a testament to NASA's enduring commitment to space exploration and their unwavering diligence in ensuring the safety of their personnel, equipment, and the mission's overall success. As we look forward to a successful launch on February 19 no earlier, everyone around the world anticipates the Discovery's 28th journey to be packed with historical significance and unforgettable moments etched in the chronicles of space exploration.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first real name of the person that agrees to invest 1000 in Ossining's business? Dr. John Harvey Kellogg opened a sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan, where he practiced his unusual methods for maintaining health, including colonic irrigation, electrical stimulus and sexual abstinence, vegetarianism and physical exercise. The sanitarium attracts well-to-do patients including William and Eleanor Lightbody, who are suffering from poor health following the death of their child. On their way to Battle Creek they meet Charles Ossining, hoping to make a fortune by exploiting the fad for health food cereals. Ossining finds a partner in Goodloe Bender. Having enlisted the services of George Kellogg, the doctor's estranged adopted son, they attempt to produce \\"Kellogg's Perfo Flakes.\\" In the sanitarium, Will Lightbody is separated from his wife, and is soon harboring lustful thoughts toward Nurse Graves and patient Ida Muntz. His wife Eleanor, meanwhile, befriends Virginia Cranehill, who has a modern attitude toward sexual pleasure, influenced by the works of Dr. Lionel Badger. Will eventually succumbs to Ida Muntz's charms. Later he learns that Ida has died during treatment. Following the death of a patient in the sinusoidal bath, and the discovery of yet another death, Will suffers a breakdown, flees the sanitarium, gets drunk and eats meat. At a restaurant, he meets Ossining, and agrees to invest 1,000 in his health food business. Will returns drunk to the sanitarium, where he is reprimanded by Dr. Kellogg and is abandoned by a distraught Eleanor. Ossining's business is a disaster, with no edible product. He and the partners resort to stealing Kellogg's cornflakes and repackaging them in their own boxes. Ossining meets his aunt, his sole investor, on visiting day at Kellogg's sanitarium, and is there exposed as a fraud and arrested.

Government officials suggest that Chinese people will take to the air, roads and railways 3.62 billion times over a 40-day period around the nation's most important holiday this year as people push their way home for family gatherings or to satisfy their new-found passion for travel. Getting tickets to all those would-be travelers is a _ challenge that tries your patience annually. And the pressure for the railway system is always the greatest. Railways are the transport of choice for low-cost long-distance travel, and that's where the ticketing system regularly falls down. Much of the criticism has focused on the railway's online purchasing system, which has been unable to keep pace with the huge demand and also failed to stop scalpers from easily getting many of the hard-to-find tickets. Railway officials believed that online sales were the fairest way to get tickets for travelers, and told reporters that the public need to be patient. While by now the railway service is far from satisfying, efforts are being made to provide online identity checks that would reduce the ticket scalping problems, and the situation is expected to get better in a few years.

This is because the rapid death of fish will disrupt the aquatic ecosystem, creating a cascade effect on other organisms that depend on fish as a food source. Moreover, fish help keep water bodies clean by consuming algae and dead organic matter. If they die in large numbers, an imbalance is created, which can lead to increased eutrophication, toxic algal blooms, and diminished water quality. Such conditions not only impact aquatic life but also affect terrestrial life and human health.

Liverpool's American owners have told Steven Gerrard he is welcome to return to Liverpool at any time, following the announcement of his departure at the end of the season. Gerrard made his Liverpool debut in 1998, and has made just shy of 700 appearances for the Reds to date. Prinicipal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner said in a statement: 'This news stirs many strong emotions for all of us connected with the club. Steven Gerrard (pictured right, with Jamie Carragher) holds the Champions League trophy in Istanbul, 2005. This season, Gerrard has found himself on the bench on a number of occasions, and will move on in May. Liverpool's Twitter page confirms the Gerrard news. 'There is sadness that such a great player and person is leaving and won't be playing for Liverpool beyond this season. 'But there is also a sense of celebration and gratitude, that we've all been privileged to watch and work with one of the true greats, not just of this club, but the game in general. 'We will all have our own personal memories of breathtaking Steven Gerrard moments; there are far too many to list.' Of those memories, many will point to the 2005 Champions League final as an overriding high point in Gerrard's career. Three down to AC Milan at half-time in Istanbul, Liverpool looked to be heading for defeat, before their captain inspired a miraculous second-half comeback to take the game to extra time. On penalties, Liverpool were victorious and Gerrard lifted the most memorable trophy of his Anfield career. Henry and Werner's statement continues: 'His contribution to the club is almost beyond measure and it's testimony to his influence, that despite Liverpool having such a long and distinguished list of legendary figures, the name Steven Gerrard will always be at the summit.

Here are possible answers to this question: - kitchen - supermarket - table - stomach - restaurant I believe the correct choice is \\"kitchen\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The prime location for preparing, cooking, and assembling food is indeed a well-equipped 'kitchen', and there are several reasons for this. Firstly, the kitchen is often designed specifically for the purpose of food preparation and cooking. It typically consists of several key elements such as a stove for cooking, a refrigerator for food storage, a sink for cleaning food and utensils, and countertops for preparing meals. This functionality and easy access to all necessary tools and appliances make it much more efficient and effective to prepare food in a kitchen rather than elsewhere. Secondly, a kitchen is a controlled environment making it a cleaner and more hygienic place to handle food. It is easier to maintain cleanliness and ensure food safety in a kitchen compared to other settings like a table, a supermarket, or a restaurant where you might have less control over the environment or where multiple people may be handling the same surfaces or tools. Thirdly, there's also the matter of appropriate storage in a kitchen. Various types of food items require different storage conditions, such as room temperature, refrigeration or freezing. A kitchen generally contains the necessary equipment for storing food properly, hence ensuring its freshness and safety. Looking at the other potential answers: A 'supermarket' is primarily a place where food is bought, not prepared. While some supermarkets may have a deli or bakery section where some food items are cooked or assembled, these are generally prepared by staff and not by the customer. A 'table', while it is an essential piece of furniture for serving and eating food, is not equipped or designed for the process of food preparation or cooking. A 'stomach', on the other hand, is where already consumed food gets digested and isn't involved in the culinary process at all. 'Restaurants' are indeed places where professional chefs prepare meals, but unless you're a chef or a restaurant employee with access to their kitchen, you won't be preparing your meals there. To sum up, while all of these options are somewhat related to the food process, the 'kitchen' is undeniably the best place to make food as it is specifically equipped, designed, and controlled for this purpose."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPT: (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"First, I will address the first question: \\"What are the traits of a person with an omega personality?\\" To do this, I will gather information on the characteristics associated with an omega personality. Step 1: Research the definition and traits of an omega personality. - An omega personality is often characterized as the opposite of an alpha personality. While alpha personalities are confident, dominant, and assertive, omega personalities tend to be introverted, submissive, and less likely to seek leadership roles. Some common traits of an omega personality include: 1. Introverted - Omega individuals tend to be quiet and introspective, preferring to be alone or in small groups rather than in large social gatherings. 2. Submissive - They are less likely to assert themselves and may often go along with the decisions of others. 3. Conflict-avoidant - Omega personalities generally avoid confrontation and would rather compromise than engage in an argument. 4. Loyal and supportive - They are often dependable friends and partners, who can offer emotional support to those around them. Next, I will address the second question: \\"How do you know if you are an omega personality?\\" To answer this, I will consider the factors that can help people identify their personality type. Step 2: Determine the criteria for identifying an omega personality. - A person can identify if they have an omega personality by analyzing their own behaviors, emotions, and thoughts against the traits associated with this personality type. They could also take personality test to get more insights on their personality. If an individual finds that they are consistently displaying several traits associated with an omega personality, it may suggest that they fall into this category. However, it is essential to remember that each individual is unique and may not fit perfectly into any predefined personality type. Now, let's discuss if these two questions are asking the same thing: Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPT: (a). no. (b). yes. The correct answer is (a). no. The first question seeks to understand the traits and characteristics of an omega personality, whereas the second question aims to provide guidance on how an individual can determine if they have an omega personality. While these questions are related, they are not essentially asking the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A government-sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County's federally funded legal aid community. The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program.

Movie title: A Good Year Movie plot: In the prologue, a young Max Skinner, whose parents have died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's vineyard estate in Provence in south-eastern France. Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical yet very successful hard-working London-based bond trader with a sense of humour. Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving he almost knocks a local cafÃ© owner, Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible. To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week. On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless. In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Like Max, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu (\\"the lost corner\\") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics. Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her during dinner at the Duflot house. Max gets updates on office politics...

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor. This frail elderly man surely did not remember this selfless act of kindness. But it made a lasting impression on me, and on what it means to be a good cop.

Massachusetts preschool discouraging kids from using the phrase, \\"best friend.\\"#WBZ @GaryBrodeNewshttps://t.co/3I8N5K4Hq1 — Ryan Kath (@ryankath) April 19, 2018 Are schools banning kids from saying they have a best friend? WBZ-TV in Boston reported on the Pentucket Workshop Preschool in Georgetown, Mass., where the mother of an enrolled 4-year-old said her daughter was discouraged from using the term. Christine Hartwell, the mother of 4-year-old Julia, told WBZ that she thought the practice was “ridiculous.” The school, she told the station, said the term can lead to feelings of exclusion and the formation of cliques. Pentucket Workshop Preschool is a licensed day-care program serving children who are nearly 3 years old to 5 years old. The day care prides itself on educating its second generation of families, with a faculty possessing a combined 250 years of teaching experience with young children. And it says it emphasizes developing social-emotional skills and independence in kids. Hartwell was quoted as saying about her daughter: “Even now, she goes to say it in a loving way, ‘I’m going to see my best friend Charlie’ or this one or that, and she looks at me sideways. She’s checking in with me to see if it’s okay.” The school did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In January, psychologist Barbara Greenberg wrote a piece in U.S. News & World Report saying: I am always fascinated by trends. And I am especially intrigued by the emerging trend among European schools, and now some American schools as well, to ban best friends. That’s right. Some schools are attempting to ban the entire concept of children having best friends. The article didn’t mention the names of any schools, however. That didn’t stop a rash of media outlets from writing about the piece as if a ban on best friends was becoming common. Many schools in the United States urge parents not to exclude their children’s classmates from an outside activity if most students are invited. That’s not the same as discouraging having a best friend or banning the use of the term on campus. Greenberg may have been referring to a Sept. 11, 2017, article in the British edition of Marie Claire magazine with this headline: “Prince George won’t be allowed to have a best friend at school.” The story said the private Thomas’s day school in Battersea — the school Prince William’s son attends — encourages students to have a lot of friends, and tells parents to invite all children to birthday parties. A 2013 article in the British newspaper the Telegraph reported that there was no official policy at the Battersea school but that its headmaster, Ben Thomas, said there was “sound judgment” behind discouraging children from picking best friends. It quoted him as saying: You can get very possessive friendships, and it is much easier if they share friendships and have a wide range of good friends rather than obsessing too much about who their best friend is. I would certainly endorse a policy which says we should have lots of good friends, not a best friend. If anybody knows of a school with a policy banning kids from having or talking about having a best friend, please let me know. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A preschool in Georgetown, Massachusetts, has banned children from using the term \\"best friend\\" in an effort to promote inclusivity and prevent the formation of cliques.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics. Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987. After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. The New York Times obituary called Rothbard \\"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did he get married?","completion":"Murray Newton Rothbard married JoAnn Schumacher in 1953, in New York City."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plot title: Suspect Movie plot: Set in Washington DC, Suspect centers on three disparate characters. Carl Wayne Anderson is a homeless, deaf-mute Vietnam veteran accused of murdering Elizabeth Quinn, a file clerk at the Justice Department. Kathleen Riley is the beleaguered Federal Public Defender assigned to represent Anderson. An agribusiness lobbyist who normally works on Capitol Hill, Eddie Sanger, is made a member of the jury and begins investigating the details of the murder himself, eventually teaming up with Riley to solve the case. We see some early scenes of Sanger's work as a lobbyist on Capitol Hill, including his efforts to win passage of a bill by seducing a Congresswoman. While not relevant to the movie's plot, these scenes are establishing shots giving us a sense for Sanger as a charming, though somewhat ruthless, person.The movie begins around Christmas with the suicide of a United States Supreme Court Justice, for which no explanation or context is given. We only see the Justice making a tape recording and then shooting himself. Shortly after the Justice's suicide, Elizabeth Quinn's body is found floating in the Potomac river, and Carl Wayne Anderson is arrested for the crime, based almost entirely on the fact that he was found sleeping in Quinn's car, which was abandoned in the parking lot where she worked (and was mostly deserted at night). Anderson explains that he found it unlocked and was just looking for a warm place to sleep since it was the dead of winter. But since he was homeless, had no alibi, and was found in Quinn's car, he was arrested for her murder. The establishing scenes show Riley trying to communicate with Anderson and realizing that he is a deaf-mute. Over time, she begins to penetrate his hard exterior and he tries to cooperate with her efforts to mount a defense for him.In the District of Columbia, all crimes are tried in the federal courts, so a murder trial that would normally be in state court was in federal court instead. Riley selects Sanger to be a member of her jury. Soon thereafter, it becomes... My question: Who do Riley and Sanger try and find evidence about?

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas.

This situation introduces negative sentiments into the review, as the customer is now faced with an issue relating to the product's durability and longevity. Further adding to the negative sentiment is the revelation that the company responsible for the heaters is no longer in business. This piece of information may cause other potential customers to be wary of purchasing the product, as warranty claims and customer support may be unavailable. Moreover, since the review specifically mentions the difficulty in finding replacement elements, current or future customers may find themselves with inadequate support to maintain the heaters' functionality in the long run. In conclusion, while the review contains elements of positivity based on the initial satisfaction of the customer, it also highlights negatives that become evident over time. Given that the heaters need replacement parts and the fact that the company has gone out of business, the negative aspects of the review become more dominant. As a result, one could argue that the overall sentiment of the review leans more on the negative side."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She divides her time between studying and caring for her younger sister Tanya, who has just blossomed into a beautiful young woman and is eager to explore her burgeoning sexuality.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the answer provided is not correct or complete. Planned Value (PV) or the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) is a vital concept in project management and earned value management systems. It represents the cost allocated for the scheduled work on a project up to a specific point in time. Planned Value is an essential metric for evaluating a project's progress and determining whether it's operating within the given budget. To understand Planned Value, it is crucial to grasp some key project management terms: 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): It is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into manageable sub-projects or tasks. A WBS aids in breaking down a complex project into smaller pieces, making it easier to assess and estimate the budget, resources, and timeline. 2. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS): BCWS refers to the sum of the budget allocations for all work scheduled up to a particular point in time. It is also known as Planned Value. 3. Earned Value (EV): Earned Value is the measurement of a project's progress based on the work completed up to a particular point in time, and it is expressed in monetary terms. It is the actual value of the work done within a given period. 4. Actual Cost (AC): Actual Cost represents the expenses incurred for the work performed up to a specific point in time. It includes the costs of equipment, materials, labor, and any other direct and indirect expenses. Now, let's dive deeper into Planned Value. It is the value of the work scheduled at a specific point in the project. Essentially, it is the cost of the work that the project team planned to accomplish during a particular period. Planned Value is generally used in conjunction with Earned Value and Actual Cost to analyze a project's performance. These metrics can help project managers to: 1. Evaluate progress: The relation between the Planned Value and Earned Value can help ascertain whether a project is lagging, moving as expected, or even ahead of schedule. 2. Measure cost-efficiency: By comparing the Planned Value with the Actual Cost, project managers can gain insight into the project's cost management and initiate corrective actions when required. 3. Forecast future performance: Analyzing Planned Value, Earned Value, and Actual Cost can help project managers predict potential issues, develop mitigation strategies, and modify plans to prevent cost overruns or delays. In summary, Planned Value is a critical concept in project management and earned value management systems, used along with Earned Value and Actual Cost. It is the cost allocated for the scheduled work on a project up to a specific point in time, allowing managers to evaluate progress, measure cost-efficiency, and forecast future performance. The answer, \\"and cost,\\" does not accurately reflect or explain the concept of Planned Value."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Paragraph: The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

This newspaper prides itself to have been read by everybody in the political field in Washington, and to be the only one in the American president's plane. Little by little, we see how things work in the editorial room: Stephen's direct boss and editor is Charles \\"Chuck\\" Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), who is constantly insisting on having every single detail checked through direct notes. The first time Stephen gets in trouble in the film it's on an article about a Republican young people convention, where he alleged they got drunk and called some prostitutes. Stephen gets into trouble because the hotel manager complains that hotel rooms did not have any drink or food fridges in them, all the opposite of what Stephen had said in his article. Chuck talks with Stephen about that. Stephen comes back some minutes later admitting he has made a mistake: he saw so many spirits bottles thrown out of the place, that he took it for granted that they came from a room saloon. Stephen says he's sorry, and that if Chuck wants his resignation, he'll sign it right away. However, Chuck is not about to do anything of that sort, and the audience is left feeling that it was too much of a ruckus over the possible existence of a portable fridge or not.Stephen's girlfriend is Caitlin Avey (Chloë Sevigny), a fellow journalist at the newspaper. She is worried because Stephen has had much success lately, she's even a bit jealous. Stephen is freelancing and writing stories for other magazines, like Rolling Stones, because his news stories have always got an edge to them: he investigates, finds out the truth and talks about humourous situations and peculiar characters. Also, to Caitlin's dismay, he's even going to be busier, as he is about to start to study law, which he considers to be more prestigious.

This question is about the reason why things keep falling even though the forces might look balanced. You see, when you're playing with a toy and you let it go, it falls because of gravity, right? So, objects keep falling due to gravity, and sometimes other forces can slow them down, like air pushing on them.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that Jan would most likely feel \\"b) brave and happy\\" after going on a hot air balloon ride and getting an amazing view of the city below. To elaborate, going on a hot air balloon ride suggests a sense of adventure and willingness to step out of one's comfort zone. The ride up in the sky in a hot air balloon has the potential to induce feelings of fear, especially for someone who might be afraid of heights. However, the context mentions Jan got an \\"amazing view of the city below,\\" which implies that he or she was not overwhelmed by any fear or anxiety and was able to appreciate the beauty of the experience. Moreover, experiencing such a stunning view from high above the ground often results in feelings of awe, excitement, and gratitude. Feelings of bravery may also emerge as a result of overcoming any initial nervousness or doubts about going on the hot air balloon ride. These emotions would contribute to a sense of happiness and a memorable experience.

Answer based on context: In mid-October 1524, Francis himself crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the head of an army numbering more than 40,000. Bourbon and d'Avalos, their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence, were in no position to offer serious resistance. The French army moved in several columns, brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance, but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle. Nevertheless, Charles de Lannoy, who had concentrated some 16,000 men to resist the 33,000 French troops closing on Milan, decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to Lodi on 26 October. Having entered Milan and installed Louis II de la Trémoille as the governor, Francis advanced on Pavia, where Antonio de Leyva remained with a sizable Imperial garrison. How many more troops did the French have than Charles de Lannoy?","completion":"To determine the difference in troop numbers between the French and Charles de Lannoy, we need to find the difference between the 33,000 French troops and the 16,000 troops under Charles de Lannoy's command. Step 1: Identify the numbers: 33,000 (French troops) and 16,000 (troops under Charles de Lannoy). Step 2: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 33,000 - 16,000 = 17,000.

How is \\"We will deal with the matter immediately.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the sentence \\"We will deal with the matter immediately.\\" can be translated to \\"Käsittelemme asian välittömästi.\\" Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"We will deal with\\" can be translated to \\"Käsittelemme\\", which is the first person plural form of the verb \\"käsitellä\\" (to handle or deal with) in present tense. In Finnish, the future tense is often expressed using the present tense. 2. \\"the matter\\" can be translated to \\"asian,\\" which is the genitive form of the noun \\"asia\\" (matter). In Finnish, the genitive case is used to show possession or that something belongs to someone or something. 3. \\"immediately\\" can be translated to \\"välittömästi\\" (immediately) in Finnish. So, when you put all these translations together, you get \\"Käsittelemme asian välittömästi,\\" which means \\"We will deal with the matter immediately.\\" in Finnish.

Article: For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \\"City of Art\\". Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793. Question: Who was the first painter to King Louis XIV?","completion":"The first painter to King Louis XIV was Pierre Mignard.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group included people that had tuberculosis? Hint: Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A pathogen is an organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the flu is pictured below ( Figure below ). Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot. Answer:","completion":"Group two included people that had tuberculosis. This can be deduced from the information given in the paragraph, which mentions that tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. Since group one consisted of people with respiratory diseases caused by viruses and group two had people with respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, it is clear that the individuals with tuberculosis belonged to group two. As noted in the text, illnesses caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, whereas those caused by viruses cannot.

Given the question \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\", is \\"get their degree\\" a valid answer? Choose from: (i). Yes. (ii). No. A:","completion":"(ii). No. After studying psychology for 8 years, it can be assumed that Kendall has already completed the necessary education to obtain a degree in the field, which usually takes about 4 years for a bachelor's, 6 years for a master's, and around 8 years (or even less) for a doctorate. With 8 years of study, Kendall has most likely surpassed the requirement for a bachelor's and even master's degree, and could be close to obtaining or may already have obtained a doctoral degree. Now that Kendall has become an expert in psychology, their next steps will more likely involve furthering their career in the field, rather than pursuing another degree. This could involve seeking employment as a psychologist, pursuing a specialized field within psychology, participating in research, teaching psychology, or even opening their private practice. Furthermore, opportunities for continued personal and professional development through attending conferences, workshops, and courses to expand their knowledge and skills will be essential. In addition, Kendall may engage in networking and collaborating with other professionals in the field to exchange ideas, pursue research, or develop new psychology programs and interventions. In conclusion, given the question, \\"What will Kendall want to do next?\\", the answer \\"get their degree\\" is not a valid response due to the assumption that Kendall has already completed the required education to obtain a degree in psychology after studying it for 8 years. Instead, their next steps might involve focusing on career advancement, continued education and professional development, and making contributions to the field of psychology through research or practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With the influx of millions of newly insured patients created by the federal health law, the Affordable Care Act, it’s clear we’re going to need more doctors to treat those patients. But we don’t have 12 years. We don’t even have a year. The main provisions that expand coverage to more people go into effect Jan. 1, 2014. So across the country, states are grappling with the problem of new patients and not enough doctors and are proposing expanding the authority of non-physician health professionals to treat more people. In California, lawmakers have proposed bills to allow nurse practitioners to practice without physician oversight and broaden the independent decision-making powers of other professions such as optometrists and pharmacists. Doctors are crying foul, saying that proponents of these efforts are using the federal law to get the expanded authority they’ve long wanted and will be putting patients at risk by allowing non-physicians to practice above their training level. Groups representing these professions are accusing the doctors of trying to protect their turf and maintain control. Read more about this latest battle on the health care reform front here.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you happen to have a box of spaghetti in your pantry, try this experiment: Pull out a single spaghetti stick and hold it at both ends. Now bend it until it breaks. How many fragments did you make? If the answer is three or more, pull out another stick and try again. Can you break the noodle in two? If not, you’re in very good company. The spaghetti challenge has flummoxed even the likes of famed physicist Richard Feynman ’39, who once spent a good portion of an evening breaking pasta and looking for a theoretical explanation for why the sticks refused to snap in two. Feynman’s kitchen experiment remained unresolved until 2005, when physicists from France pieced together a theory to describe the forces at work when spaghetti — and any long, thin rod — is bent. They found that when a stick is bent evenly from both ends, it will break near the center, where it is most curved. This initial break triggers a “snap-back” effect and a bending wave, or vibration, that further fractures the stick. Their theory, which won the 2006 Ig Nobel Prize, seemed to solve Feynman’s puzzle. But a question remained: Could spaghetti ever be coerced to break in two? The answer, according to a new MIT study, is yes — with a twist. In a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers report that they have found a way to break spaghetti in two, by both bending and twisting the dry noodles. They carried out experiments with hundreds of spaghetti sticks, bending and twisting them with an apparatus they built specifically for the task. The team found that if a stick is twisted past a certain critical degree, then slowly bent in half, it will, against all odds, break in two. The researchers say the results may have applications beyond culinary curiosities, such as enhancing the understanding of crack formation and how to control fractures in other rod-like materials such as multifiber structures, engineered nanotubes, or even microtubules in cells. “It will be interesting to see whether and how twist could similarly be used to control the fracture dynamics of two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials,” says co-author Jörn Dunkel, associate professor of physical applied mathematics at MIT. “In any case, this has been a fun interdisciplinary project started and carried out by two brilliant and persistent students — who probably don’t want to see, break, or eat spaghetti for a while.” The two students are Ronald Heisser ’16, now a graduate student at Cornell University, and Vishal Patil, a mathematics graduate student in Dunkel’s group at MIT. Their co-authors are Norbert Stoop, instructor of mathematics at MIT, and Emmanuel Villermaux of Université Aix Marseille. Experiments (above) and simulations (below) show how dry spaghetti can be broken into two or more fragments, by twisting and bending. A deep dish dive Heisser, together with project partner Edgar Gridello, originally took up the challenge of breaking spaghetti in the spring of 2015, as a final project for 18.354 (Nonlinear Dynamics: Continuum Systems), a course taught by Dunkel. They had read about Feynman’s kitchen experiment, and wondered whether spaghetti could somehow be broken in two and whether this split could be controlled. “They did some manual tests, tried various things, and came up with an idea that when he twisted the spaghetti really hard and brought the ends together, it seemed to work and it broke into two pieces,” Dunkel says. “But you have to twist really strongly. And Ronald wanted to investigate more deeply.” So Heisser built a mechanical fracture device to controllably twist and bend sticks of spaghetti. Two clamps on either end of the device hold a stick of spaghetti in place. A clamp at one end can be rotated to twist the dry noodle by various degrees, while the other clamp slides toward the twisting clamp to bring the two ends of the spaghetti together, bending the stick. Heisser and Patil used the device to bend and twist hundreds of spaghetti sticks, and recorded the entire fragmentation process with a camera, at up to a million frames per second. In the end, they found that by first twisting the spaghetti at almost 360 degrees, then slowly bringing the two clamps together to bend it, the stick snapped exactly in two. The findings were consistent across two types of spaghetti: Barilla No. 5 and Barilla No. 7, which have slightly different diameters. Experiments (above) and simulations (below) show how dry spaghetti can be broken into two or more fragments, by twisting and bending. Noodle twist In parallel, Patil began to develop a mathematical model to explain how twisting can snap a stick in two. To do this, he generalized previous work by the French scientists Basile Audoly and Sebastien Neukirch, who developed the original theory to describe the “snap-back effect,” in which a secondary wave caused by a stick’s initial break creates additional fractures, causing spaghetti to mostly snap in three or more fragments. Patil adapted this theory by adding the element of twisting, and looked at how twist should affect any forces and waves propagating through a stick as it is bent. From his model, he found that, if a 10-inch-long spaghetti stick is first twisted by about 270 degrees and then bent, it will snap in two, mainly due to two effects. The snap-back, in which the stick will spring back in the opposite direction from which it was bent, is weakened in the presence of twist. And, the twist-back, where the stick will essentially unwind to its original straightened configuration, releases energy from the rod, preventing additional fractures. “Once it breaks, you still have a snap-back because the rod wants to be straight,” Dunkel explains. “But it also doesn’t want to be twisted.” Just as the snap-back will create a bending wave, in which the stick will wobble back and forth, the unwinding generates a “twist wave,” where the stick essentially corkscrews back and forth until it comes to rest. The twist wave travels faster than the bending wave, dissipating energy so that additional critical stress accumulations, which might cause subsequent fractures, do not occur. “That’s why you never get this second break when you twist hard enough,” Dunkel says. The team found that the theoretical predictions of when a thin stick would snap in two pieces, versus three or four, matched with their experimental observations. “Taken together, our experiments and theoretical results advance the general understanding of how twist affects fracture cascades,” Dunkel says. For now, he says the model is successful at predicting how twisting and bending will break long, thin, cylindrical rods such as spaghetti. As for other pasta types? “Linguini is different because it’s more like a ribbon,” Dunkel says. “The way the model is constructed it applies to perfectly cylindrical rods. Although spaghetti isn’t perfect, the theory captures its fracture behavior pretty well,” The research was supported, in part, by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the James S. McDonnell Foundation. ||||| If you hold a piece of dry spaghetti at two ends and try to snap it, it almost never breaks cleanly into two. Seriously—try it. The strand splits into two long pieces, and one or more smaller chunks of pasta usually ping away from the break. In case you were wondering, mathematicians have finally figured out a technique to ensure the long-coveted two-piece break. The secret isn’t bend and snap, it’s bend and twist. Believe it or not, the mysteries of spaghetti have long troubled the great minds of science. Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman—more famous for his Nobel Prize-winning quantum electrodynamics research and his work on the atomic bomb—reportedly puzzled over the problem. In 2005, researchers finally explained the mystery of why the pasta never seems to snap into two. When you bend a long, thin rod like a piece of spaghetti, it breaks near the middle. This is the most curved region of the rod. Basile Audoly and Sebastien Neukirch worked out this causes a snap-back, where a vibration races through the stick and causes other breaks. Their revelatory research was recognized with 2006’s Ig Nobel prize for physics. Other winners of that year's awards—which celebrate improbable research—include Nic Svenson and Piers Barnes, who won the mathematics prize for working out how many photos you need to take to ensure nobody’s blinking in a group photo. Taking this work to its logical conclusion, Ronald Heisser, Vishal Patil and other researchers snapped hundreds more sticks of spaghetti to figure out how to achieve a two-piece break. Their findings were published online Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. “They did some manual tests, tried various things, and came up with an idea that when he twisted the spaghetti really hard and brought the ends together, it seemed to work and it broke into two pieces,” said co-author Jörn Dunkel, associate professor of physical applied mathematics at MIT in a statement. “But you have to twist really strongly. And [Heisser] wanted to investigate more deeply.” Heisser constructed a mechanical fracture device to twist the sticks with more precision. He and Patil filmed the device break hundreds of spaghetti sticks to crack the recipe for a perfect break. First, they discovered, you have to twist the spaghetti at an angle of nearly 360 degrees. Then slowly draw the clamps holding each end of the strand together until it snaps. The technique works for both Barilla No 5 and Barilla No 7 spaghetti variations, the researchers reported. Patil figured out why this technique preserved the integrity of the strands using mathematics. “Once [spaghetti] breaks, you still have a snap-back because the rod wants to be straight,” Dunkel explained. “But it also doesn’t want to be twisted.” MIT/Heisser et al A “twist wave” generated by the unraveling strand moves faster than the vibration from the “snap-back.” This dissipates the potentially destructive energy and stops it fracturing the spaghetti any further. “That’s why you never get this second break when you twist hard enough,” Dunkel said. Of course, if you don’t have a tailored spaghetti-snapping machine, you can always try it by hand. Twist your strand of spaghetti really hard and slowly bend, and maybe you too will achieve a perfect two-piece break. Basile Audoly and Sebastien Neukirch did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Scientists at MIT have found a way to break a dry spaghetti noodle into only two pieces, which has puzzled people including physicist Richard Feynman.

Preeclampsia is a serious disorder of pregnancy characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, edema, and coagulation and vascular abnormalities. At the cellular level, abnormalities include increased calcium concentration in platelets, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes. Recent studies have shown that antibodies directed against angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptors are also highly associated with preeclampsia.', 'We tested the hypothesis that AT1 receptor-agonistic antibodies (AT1-AAs) could activate AT1 receptors, leading to an increased intracellular concentration of free calcium and to downstream activation of Ca2+ signaling pathways. Sera of 30 pregnant patients, 16 diagnosed with severe preeclampsia and 14 normotensive, were examined for the presence of IgG capable of stimulating intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. IgG from all preeclamptic patients activated AT1 receptors and increased intracellular free calcium. In contrast, none of the normotensive individuals had IgG capable of activating AT1 receptors. The specific mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ by AT1-AAs was blocked by losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and by a 7-amino-acid peptide that corresponds to a portion of the second extracellular loop of the AT1 receptor. In addition, we have shown that AT1-AA-stimulated mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ results in the activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells.","completion":"What is the effect of AT1 receptor-agonistic antibodies (AT1-AAs) on intracellular free calcium concentration in pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia, and how can this effect be blocked?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His robot was special, because it could turn into a tiny cleaning machine. The boy whispered a secret magic word to the robot and it transformed into a little mop with wheels. The mop started rolling all around the room, sucking up the spilled juice from the floor. As the boy watched the robot mop clean up the mess, he noticed a little puppy sniffing around the juice. The puppy had come inside from the garden and saw the mess too. The puppy decided to help the little mop by licking up some of the spilled juice. Together, the robot mop and the puppy made a great team. The floor was getting cleaner and cleaner every minute. Soon, there were only a few sticky spots left. The boy grabbed one of his mom's clean sponges, dipped it in some soapy water, and scrubbed the remaining spots until the floor was as good as new. The boy, the robot mop, and the puppy were all very proud of their teamwork. To celebrate their amazing clean-up effort, they decided to have a little dance party. The boy played some fun music, and they all danced around the room, laughing and having a great time.

Write highlights for this article: A Muslim community leader who had the Sydney cafe gunman at his house for lunch and dinner claims he was not capable of plotting and executing this week's deadly siege or his controversial activities over the past several years without help. Self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, a siege that ended in a hail of gunfire early Tuesday that left two hostages and the gunman dead. Some commentators this week labelled the crazed gunman a 'lone wolf'. But Jamal Daoud, a Muslim activist who had dealings with Monis over several months in 2010, told Daily Mail Australia that Monis could not have been acting without some form of assistance. 'I don't think that he was acting alone. I don't. I really don't,' Mr Daoud said, adding he believed Monis would not have been capable of conducting the siege plan in complete secrecy without support or training from someone here or overseas. Mr Daoud did not have any direct knowledge of any assistance to Monis. Scroll down for video. This pictures shows Muslim community activist Jamal Daoud with the man who he was shocked would one day become a 'violent terrorist' - self-styled Sheikh Man Horan Monis, the gunman who held eighteen people hostage for more than sixteen hours in Sydney this week until he was gunned down by police. This picture was taken at a large celebration for the birth of Daoud's first son. Fanatic: Man Haron Monis in the second half of 2010. Mr Daoud says he cut all ties with the self-proclaimed sheik. Protest: Man Horan Monis is pictured here attending a rally alongside various members of the Social Justice Network and people of other affiliations. Moment of terror: Hostages are forced to hold the Islamic Shahada flag in the window of the Lindt chocolate cafe. Free at last: Lindt cafe worker and hostage Elly Chen bolts for freedom on Monday afternoon. She was one of five hostages who managed to escape before it came to a bloody end around 2am on Tuesday. Mr Daoud questioned how Monis was capable of executing his abusive letter-writing campaign to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel in 2008 - which he and his wife Amirah Droudis were later convicted for. He also said he believed Monis would not have been able to publish inflammatory videos on his personal website - logistically or technically - several years ago. In the YouTube clips, a woman who appears to be his wife, praised the Bali bombings and September 11 terrorist attacks. 'My understanding and the people who knew him said he is not capable of doing this himself - because they [would] need a lot of help or support,' Mr Daoud said. There is no connection known between Ms Droudis and the siege. Mr Daoud first met Monis at a rally to protest the visit of Israeli Vice-President Silvan Shalom to Australia on December 3, 2009, where the self-styled Sheikh - an Iranian refugee who arrived in the country in 1996 - introduced himself as a 'peace activist'. Monis handed Mr Daoud his business card and said he hoped they would participate in future protest actions together. They did just that, participating in various demonstrations, including about the detention of asylum seekers at Villawood, in Sydney's west. But their relationship did not last for long, Mr Daoud said: 'Our contact did not last more than a few months.' Their final encounter at a Ramadan dinner hosted at Mr Daoud's home for disadvantaged members of the community. Mr Daoud's organisation, the Social Justice Network, cut ties with Monis around that time following the publication of the videos featuring the woman believed to be Ms Droudis. In one video, the woman said: 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore.' 'Amirah': In a series of videos on Man Horan Monis' website, a woman believed to be his partner Amirah Droudis celebrated the Bali bombings, Holocaust and September 11 terrorist attacks. The Social Justice Network cut ties with Monis in late 2010 following his bizarre behaviour and the publication of various videos, including one wear a woman believed to be his wife Amirah (pictured) called herself a terrorist. Many members of the Social Justice Network are who hold terrorism 'strongly in contempt', Mr Daoud said. Mr Daoud said, 'We wanted to tell her, this is not Islam'. He added that there were questions over how Monis met his wife - who used to work as a hairdresser and partied in Kings Cross bars but later converted to Islam and became an apparent follower of Monis. Members of the Mr Daoud's group - which protest over matters such as the treatment asylum seekers and Palestine - also doubted Monis' sanity and refused to be part of his own bizarre protest plans, including a demonstration in which he shackled himself to Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court over charges relating to his letter-writing campaign. Mr Daoud said Monis constantly refused to answer his questions about whether he was receiving any support in his letter-writing or video campaigns. 'We could not keep any clue about what's going on in his mind or his plans,' he said. Mr Daoud was unable to name individuals who could have been acting in concert with Monis this week, or over the past several years. A New South Wales police spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr Daoud's claims, saying their investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, police executed a search warrant on the home of Amirah Droudis - where Monis spent much time - carting away several bags of material and documents. Wife: Amirah Droudis is pictured here arriving at Campsie Police Station following dramatic raids on her home in Belmore, in Sydney's outer west, on Tuesday. Raid: Police officers from the Critical Incident Unit seized several documents from Ms Droudis' home in Belmore on Tuesday. Ominous warning: Man Horan Monis was not on government terror watchlists at the time of the siege. Both the Federal and NSW governments are examining various aspects of Monis' activities in Australia, including how he obtained political asylum in Australia, how he acquired the sawn-off shot gun he used in Monday's siege and his interactions with various government agencies. Mr Daoud told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife were floored to find out Monis was responsible for the siege. He would only hear of him again when investigators examining the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, contacted him for information earlier this year. 'We were shocked, me and my wife,' he said. 'We were shocked and we could not believe that he was able to do this. 'This is why we think he was receiving some intensive brainwashing and training, of how to hide things, you know. 'We are thinking he is not acting alone because someone was planning this very secretive mission for the last few years. 'Somebody planned this very carefully you know. Everything was kept very secret. He was able to reach his targets and execute his final mission.' Police said during the siege that the gunman's motives were unclear, and that it appeared that he was acting alone. It later emerged that one of his few demands was to have a flag of the Islamic State militant group brought to him. This two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years. A two storey brick house in the south-western Sydney suburb of Green Valley was Monis's home on and off for eight years until his former wife Noleen finally forbade him to visit. The house, where Noleen Pal's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, live, has a granny flat in the backyard where Monis lived full time with Ms Pal. After their relationship foundered he continued to visit. According to court documents, Monis was staying two days a week until Ms Pal told him, on June 18 2011, not to come back. Monis' stayed in an external flat at the back of the house, where his ex-wife's parents, Ashok and Marian Pal, still live. Ms Pal at one point left Sydney and travelled to stay with her godfather, Ayyat Khalik, in San Francisco. Mr Khalik has told San Francisco TV station Eye 5 KPix that Ms Pal sought refuge for about a month before returning to Sydney, after which she was murdered, in April 2013. On Thursday, as Mrs Pal sheltered inside the Green Valley house, police told Daily Mail Australia the family was still 'very frightened' following Monday's siege.","completion":"A Muslim community leader who previously had interactions with the Sydney café gunman, Man Horan Monis, has recently claimed that he does not believe Monis was capable of executing the deadly siege or other controversial activities in the past without assistance.

The premise states: \\"The riders twisted and wove through the burning houses while the foot soldiers continued swarming the east and west.\\" The first part of the premise, \\"The riders twisted and wove through the burning houses,\\" indicates that there were riders involved in the situation, and they were navigating through the area where houses were burning. However, it does not specify the direction in which they were moving or whether they left the area. The second part, \\"the foot soldiers continued swarming the east and west,\\" informs us about the foot soldiers' movements in the east and west directions.

Select from the following. a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no. And the answer is:","completion":"a). Yes. The premise \\"You're so darned plucky\\" implies a description of someone who is spirited, determined, and shows courage or resolution in the face of difficulties. The word \\"plucky\\" is often used informally to refer to someone who doesn’t easily give up, who is full of tenacity and persistence. The hypothesis \\"You are so persistent\\" essentially conveys the same traits. The idea of persistence implies strong continuous effort despite difficulty or delay in achieving success. One who is persistent is, by nature, also plucky as they continue steadfastly, perhaps even stubbornly, towards their goals without being easily deterred. In essence, both the premise and hypothesis are describing a person with a strongly persevering character. Hence, it is correct to argue that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. Input: By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News The former children's laureate is no stranger to stage or screen adaptations of his books, though few have had the galloping success of War Horse. The West End hit transfers to Broadway in March 2011, with Spielberg's movie version due out the following August. The cast includes Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Benedict Cumberbatch (currently in TV's Sherlock), Peter Mullan and Jeremy Irvine. The book tells the story of a farm horse, Joey, who gets separated from his owner and ends up in the trenches of World War I. What's astonishing is that War Horse made it this far at all. Morpurgo, who wrote the book in 1982, admits it did nothing spectacular for years. \\"It nearly won a prize but failed. It was translated into three or four languages. It was published in America and didn't succeed. It stayed in print - just about - for about 25 years. It simply was not a book that anyone really knew about or cared about.\\" 'Spellbinding' Spielberg All that changed when it came to the attention of the National Theatre, which was on the look-out for an animal-centric drama. The show opened in 2007 to widespread acclaim. And then Hollywood came knocking on the stable door. \\"The Spielberg thing was extraordinary,\\" says Morpurgo. \\"It worked unbelievably quickly. The deal was done within weeks and the film is going to be made within months.\\" Morpurgo met Spielberg to discuss the project, and has been kept in the loop as the screenplay (by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis) has developed. \\"Steven Spielberg was wonderfully engaging and inquisitive about the whole history of it,\\" Morpurgo recalls. \\"It was the most spellbinding thing to sit across the table from one of the world's great storytellers.\\" The 66-year-old author has high hopes for the big screen War Horse: \\"I'd like it to be the iconic movie of World War I since All Quiet on the Western Front or Oh! What a Lovely War.\\" Has Morpurgo been surprised by the novel's slow-burning success? \\"Am I little surprised?\\" he answers, with a hint of disbelief at the question. \\"Yes, I'm a little surprised, but I'm also relatively pleased.\\" Tractor tale The book Farm Boy is a \\"sequel\\" to War Horse in that it continues the story of Joey after World War I. Morpurgo, however, isn't fond of sequels: \\"I don't like going back to to the same field to graze.\\" But he was persuaded to revisit Joey's story by the illustrator Michael Foreman - who suggested a story about how tractors changed the face of farming. \\"I'd also had a few letters from kids asking what happened to Joey when he comes back from World War I? How did he manage back on the farm?\\" More than 30 years ago Morpurgo and his wife Clare set up Farms for City Children in Devon, which gives children the opportunity to work with animals. \\"I'm in the wonderful, privileged position of being able to witness this enthusiasm that urban people seem to have when they first come into the countryside,\\" says Morpurgo. The stage version of Farm Boy - which opens in Edinburgh next week - is a more modest production than War Horse. \\"If you went in with the expectations of the immense complexity of the lighting and design and amazing puppets of War Horse then you would be disappointed,\\" says Morpurgo. \\"This is a miniature portrait but it's beautifully crafted - all you have on stage is this wonderful old tractor and two people - they take several roles. It's how theatre should be done.\\" Morpurgo hasn't adapted these recent stage or screen versions of his books because after some earlier attempts he discovered he \\"really wasn't very good at it\\". But there is interest in the film rights to other books such as Private Peaceful (another story from World War I). And it would be surprising - as the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic approaches - if no-one wanted to make a version of Kaspar: Prince of Cats, the story of a cat at the Savoy Hotel who ends up on the doomed luxury liner. Both Private Peaceful and Kaspar contain powerful emotional punches that pull the rug from under readers of all ages. \\"Life catches us out,\\" admits Morpurgo. \\"I know perfectly well as a father and grandfather that life is complicated and there are sadnesses and there are joys, and I reflect those in my stories. \\"What I don't try to do is talk down to children and pretend that everything works out and it's all right. I think we must write about those things not in a way that is traumatic, but in a way that touches their hearts.\\" Farm Boy is on at the Edinburgh Suite, Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, from 5 - 30 Aug prior to an autumn UK tour.

Please answer this question: Who is the leader of the Decepticons (usually)?","completion":"The leader of the Decepticons, a faction of transforming robots from the fictional Transformers universe, is most commonly known as Megatron. Megatron is a powerful and imposing figure who is characterized by his ruthless ambition, cunning intellect, and unwavering commitment to the destruction of the Autobots, the heroic faction led by his arch-nemesis, Optimus Prime. Megatron's ultimate goal is usually total domination over the planet Cybertron, where the Transformers originate from, and often extends to other planets such as Earth. Megatron transforms into various alternate modes throughout different iterations of the Transformers franchise. In the original 1984 cartoon series, he transforms into a Walther P38 handgun, a toy of which was released in the same year as part of the first wave of Transformers toys. In later series and adaptations, Megatron has had various alternate forms ranging from a Cybertronian jet, a tank, a truck, or even a predatory dragon. Conceptually, Megatron was created by American toy designer Bob Budiansky, who was assigned by Hasbro to develop character names and personalities for the Transformers toy line that was initially brought over from Japan. His Japanese counterpart from the Diaclone and Microchange toy lines was named Gun Robo P-38. The character's iconic voice in the original animated series and several other adaptations was provided by veteran voice actor Frank Welker. Megatron's personality is marked by his authoritarian rule, fear-inspiring charisma, and cunning battle strategies. He is not only a formidable warrior, but also an adept orator, rallying the Decepticons around his vision of an oppressive regime ruled by unchallenged power and ruled by the strongest. However, he is also known for his personal code of honor, which sometimes leads him to forge brief, uneasy alliances with the Autobots when facing a greater threat. Over the years, the character of Megatron has undergone numerous changes based on different adaptations and continuities. Each iteration offers a unique perspective on the character, often exploring different aspects, origins, and motivations. However, the core essence of Megatron as the cruel, calculating, and power-hungry leader of the Decepticons remains consistent across these adaptations. Some of the key adaptations featuring Megatron as the leader of the Decepticons include: 1. The original 1980s animated series, \\"The Transformers\\" 2. Transformers: Generation 2 3. \\"Beast Wars: Transformers\\" and \\"Beast Machines: Transformers,\\" in which Megatron is a descendant of the original Megatron and transforms into a tyrannosaurus rex and a dragon, respectively. 4. The \\"Unicron Trilogy\\" (Transformers: Armada, Transformers: Energon, and Transformers: Cybertron) 5. The live-action Transformers film series directed by Michael Bay 6. Transformers: Animated 7. Transformers: Prime 8. Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 series) 9. Various comic book adaptations by Marvel, Dreamwave Productions, and IDW Publishing In conclusion, the leader of the Decepticons is usually Megatron, a character marked by his ambition, relentless pursuit of power, uncompromising authority, ruthlessness, and tactical brilliance. Throughout the years, the character of Megatron has gone through numerous changes and reinterpretations, but always remains a constant symbol of fear, tyranny, and unrelenting force within the Transformers universe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The air around her seemed thick with tension, and it was clear that something was amiss. As she hurriedly maneuvered her way past Erin, she cast a reassuring smile at her other daughter, silently conveying that she would attend to her concerns immediately after addressing Natalie's. Erin, ever the understanding and empathetic sibling, nodded reassuringly. She instinctively knew something was unusually troubling Natalie and that it required their mother's immediate attention. Natalie, her eyes wide with fear and brimming with unshed tears, was hunched over in an awkward position, clutching a piece of paper. The paper quivered in her trembling hands as she presented it wordlessly to her mother, her gaze never leaving the floor. The mother took the paper, her heart pounding in anticipation of what she may discover. As her eyes carefully scanned the content, they gradually widened with shock. The paper was a letter, a threatening and malicious letter that had evidently shaken Natalie to her core. The contents of the letter were nothing short of vile - filled with hateful speech, cruel insults, and harrowing threats of violence. The mother quickly glanced at her daughter, her maternal instincts kicking into high gear as she embraced the frightened girl to calm her down and provide a sense of security. Immediately after reassuring Natalie, the mother instinctively knew that they needed to take action. This letter was not to be taken lightly, and the safety and wellbeing of her daughters were her utmost priority.

Having experienced her fair share of life's challenges, the mother was no stranger to hardship. However, the letter presented a new level of malevolence that she had never encountered, and the notion that someone out there harbored such ill-intent towards her daughter was unfathomable. The mother asked Erin to stay with Natalie while she made requisite phone calls. Contacting the local police was the first order of business. She proceeded to inform them about the situation, providing them with the details of the malicious letter and expressing her concern for her daughters' safety. Once she had reported the incident, the mother contacted the school principal and informed them of the threats made towards her daughter, ensuring that the educational institution was aware and could take the necessary precautions. Meanwhile, Erin, with heartwarming sisterly dedication, sat by Natalie's side, offering her unwavering support. They spoke in hushed whispers about the incident, trying to come to terms with the unsettling reality that had befallen them. As they drew comfort from each other's presence, the bond between the sisters only strengthened. Convinced that their mother would tackle the issue with utmost precision and care, they placed their trust in her, knowing she would do whatever it took to shield them from further harm.

The retailer said in court papers filed Monday that while it received qualified bids for assets—which include the brand names of Toys “R” Us, Babies “R” Us, registry lists, website domains, Geoffrey the Giraffe and other assets—it has opted to forgo a much-anticipated bankruptcy auction for its brand... ||||| FILE PHOTO: A closed Toys 'R' Us store is seen near York, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Phil Noble (Reuters) - The top lenders of Toys ‘R’ Us have decided to cancel the bankruptcy auction of its brand name and other intellectual property assets and instead plan to revive the Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us brand names, a court filing on Monday showed. The bankrupt retailer’s debtors aim to open a new Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us branding company that maintains existing global license agreements and can invest and develop new retail shops. The lenders also plan to expand its international presence and further develop its private brands business. The bids were not superior to the plan to revive the brand as it did not offer “probable economic recovery” to creditors as well as benefits to stakeholders who would maintain the brands under the new independent U.S. business, the court filing showed. Toys “R” Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September last year, hoping to restructure some 5 billion in debt, much of which stemmed from a 6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005. But the company changed course in March, saying it would sell its operations in Canada, Asia and Europe, and shut down in the United States.

They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' .

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm. - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990.

This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic. - Banaadir (or \\"Bandir\\") is an administrative region (\\"gobol\\") in southeastern Somalia.

The sartorius muscle is found in which part of the human body?","completion":"The sartorius muscle is found in the lower extremity of the human body, specifically in the thigh region. It is the longest muscle in the human body and has a unique, ribbon-like shape, and it extends diagonally from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the medial side of the proximal tibia. The sartorius muscle plays a significant role in various movements and functions of the leg. The origin of the sartorius muscle can be traced at the outer edge of the anterior superior iliac spine, a bony projection on the topmost part of the hip bone. From there, it runs obliquely across the front and middle of the thigh, passing over the quadriceps femoris muscle, then descends medially toward the knee joint. It attaches to the medial aspect of the tibia through a tendinous connection, known as the pes anserinus, which also involves the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles. The sartorius muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve, which supplies both sensory and motor functions to the muscle. Additionally, blood supply to the sartorius muscle comes from the muscular branches of the femoral artery. In terms of function, the sartorius muscle is a critical component in various joint movements of the lower limb. It acts on both the hip and knee joints, and its activities are divided into three key categories: flexion, abduction, and external rotation. 1. Flexion: The sartorius muscle contributes to the flexion of the hip joint by bringing the thigh nearer to the trunk and bending the knee joint by drawing the lower leg upward. It aids in activities such as climbing stairs, running, or lifting the leg higher when a person tries to climb over a barrier. 2. Abduction: The sartorius muscle is involved in the abduction of the thigh, moving the leg away from the body's midline. Abduction is essential when spreading the legs or moving in a lateral direction. 3. External rotation: Lastly, the sartorius muscle helps in the external rotation of the thigh, turning it outward. This movement is crucial when rotating the leg for walking, dancing, or changing direction. In certain cross-legged positions, such as when sitting on the floor or meditating, the sartorius muscle is also significantly engaged. Due to this muscle's involvement in these positions, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"tailor's muscle,\\" as tailors historically sat cross-legged on the ground while working. In summary, the sartorius muscle is a vital component of the human lower extremity, particularly in the thigh region. it plays a crucial role in the movements of the hip and knee joints, including flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Understanding the location, structure, and function of the sartorius muscle is essential for appreciating the full complexity of the human anatomy and the vast range of movements and activities the human body can perform."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After retirement at 45 years Should John Brown be considered a villain or a hero based on his actions in the name of abolition? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, dear, these questions do not have the same meaning. Let me explain each one to you: 1. The first question is asking if moving from Mumbai to Belgaum is a good idea for someone who is retiring at the age of 45. So, it's like someone asking if it's nice to go live in a new city after they stop working. It's about moving from a big, busy city like Mumbai to a smaller, calmer place like Belgaum. 2. The second question is asking whether we should think of a man named John Brown as a good guy or a bad guy based on what he did to try to stop something called \\"slavery.\\" Slavery was when people used to own other people and make them work without pay and treat them very badly. So, this question is talking about whether we believe the actions he took to stop slavery would make him a hero (like a superhero who saves people) or a villain (like the bad guys the superheroes fight against).

A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient, originating in Arabic poetry in Arabia long before the birth of Islam. It is derived from the Arabian panegyric \\"qasida\\". The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, it is a genre that has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. - The Patiala gharana is one of the \\"gharanas\\" of vocal Hindustani classical music. It was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan (known as Alia-fattu) and was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala, Punjab and was known for ghazal, thumri, and khyal styles of singing. - Patiala is a city in southeastern Punjab, in northern India. It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of Patiala district. Patiala is located around the \\"Qila Mubarak\\" (the Fortunate Castle). It was constructed by chieftain 'Baba Ala Singh', who founded the royal dynasty of the Patiala State in 1763. - Begum Parveen Sultana ( Assamese : ) ( born 10 July 1950 ) is an Assamese Hindustani classical singer of the Patiala Gharana .

The style is sometimes called \\"North Indian classical music\\" or \\"Shstriya Sangt\\". It is a tradition that has been evolving since the 12th century CE, in North India. Today, it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music, the other being Carnatic music, the classical tradition of South India. - Khyal (or Khayal, Urdu: , Hindi: ) is the modern genre of classical singing in North India. Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning \\"imagination\\". It is thought to have developed out of Dhrupad introducing frequent taans and alankars in it. It appeared more recently than dhrupad, is a more free and flexible form, and it provides greater scope for improvisation. Like all Indian classical music, khyal is modal, with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts. The modes are called raga, and each raga is a complicated framework of melodic rules.

Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that \\"I’ve adopted a philosophy of the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama.

Patch's mother was named Silver, because high summer sun made her fur shine that colour. She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded.

The 'Snapfacts' book is aimed at people aged 13 to 25 in Edinburgh. It has been slammed by critics who say it will give the idea drugs are OK. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Controversial \\"Snapfacts\\" Booklet Issued by Edinburgh Council Raises Concerns Among Critics The Edinburgh Council and the city's Drug and Alcohol Project has recently issued a controversial booklet called \\"Snapfacts,\\" which is aimed at individuals aged 13 to 25 in Edinburgh. The booklet has drawn widespread criticism from concerned parents, educators, and other stakeholders who argue that its content encourages drug use, trivializes the dangers of substance abuse, and perpetuates a culture of leniency around drugs. Intended as an educational resource, the Snapfacts booklet provides an overview of various drugs, including their street names, effects, and potential risks. However, it also goes a step further to provide safety tips for those who may choose to partake in recreational drug use. Some of the advice provided includes washing one's nose after each session of cocaine use and taking regular breaks from dancing while using ecstasy. Critics claim that such guidance essentially condones drug use and normalizes it among young people. Detractors of the Snapfacts booklet argue that these safety suggestions may inadvertently convey the message that drugs are acceptable and even safe if used correctly. This, in turn, could lead to more teenagers and young adults experimenting with drugs, placing their health and well-being at risk. It also runs the risk of undermining the numerous anti-drug campaigns and educational programs aimed at preventing substance abuse in the first place. Proponents of the controversial booklet argue that it takes a realistic and pragmatic approach to addressing a complex issue. They posit that teenagers and young adults are already exposed to drugs, and that by providing accurate and practical information related to drug use, they are more likely to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of their social environments. While this argument has merit, it does not necessarily justify providing explicit safety tips on how to use harmful substances. As it stands, the Snapfacts booklet seemingly straddles the line between harm reduction and promoting risky behavior. To effectively address substance abuse among the youth, a more comprehensive approach is required. Advocates and critics agree that prevention through education is essential; however, the current format of the Snapfacts booklet raises doubt about the efficacy of its methods. Responsible drug education should focus on the dangers and risks associated with various substances, provide support for individuals struggling with addiction, and ultimately discourage drug use rather than provide instructions on how to use them safely. In conclusion, the controversial Snapfacts booklet issued by the Edinburgh Council and the city's Drug and Alcohol Project is a contentious issue that has raised concerns from critics who argue that this harm reduction approach sends the wrong message to young people about drugs. The booklet, while seeking to educate its target demographic, risks undermining the efforts of anti-drug campaigns and may inadvertently promote drug use by providing safety tips for those who choose to engage in recreational drug use. It is crucial to find a balance between providing accurate information and not promoting or glamorizing drugs. A more comprehensive and responsible approach that emphasizes prevention, education, and support is needed to ensure that young people in Edinburgh and across the United Kingdom are equipped with the knowledge and resources to make informed decisions regarding substance use and abuse."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Let's explore both possible interpretations. Positive interpretation: If the phrase is used in a positive context, it implies that the speaker is looking forward to the event, experience, or situation in question. They may be anticipating a favorable outcome and expecting it to be a highlight of their year. For example, consider the statement, \\"This upcoming concert is the best event I'm likely to see all year.\\" Here, the speaker expresses a positive sentiment, suggesting that they believe the concert will be an enjoyable and memorable experience. Negative interpretation: On the other hand, the phrase can also be taken in a negative context if the speaker appears to be anticipating a negative outcome or viewing the situation with dread or disappointment.

So if you don't like greasy food, these are the last thing you should order. But dang, they are awesome. :) So, I like shuffleboard. Enough that I've played for shirts before (of which I won, by the way). When my opponent lost their shirt, Monkey Pants and any other patrons didn't even seem to mind. After all, they have a shirtless shot 1-2x a night anyways so it isn't completely uncommon to see shirtless people in here. Drinks seem to be reasonable here as well, especially if you order some of their special drinks. Food is pretty decent as well and I'd put it about one step above bar food in some cases. I'm not sure how long they have been doing it... but they had a \\"power saver\\" night where they wouldn't use lights, but rather candles for their lighting.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis \\"It isn't simple\\" is entailed by the premise \\"it's complicated.\\" The term \\"entailment\\" in the context of logical reasoning refers to a relationship between statements where if one statement is true, then the other statement must also be true by virtue of logical implication. To understand the nuances of this entailment, let's break down the two given statements. 1. The premise: \\"it's complicated\\" When we say that something is \\"complicated,\\" it implies that the situation, idea, or subject matter is difficult to understand or comprehend due to its complex nature or the presence of multiple interconnected factors. This ultimately conveys that the situation is not easy or straightforward to deal with or explain. 2. The hypothesis: \\"It isn't simple\\" The term \\"simple\\" is often used as an antonym for \\"complicated.\\" When we claim that something isn't simple, we are implying that it is not easy to understand, explain, or deal with, which means that it consists of intricate relationships or aspects that make it more challenging to comprehend. Now, as we look at the connections between these two statements, we can see the logical entailment in their relationship: - The premise claims that the subject matter is complicated, which means that it must not be simple. - The hypothesis states that the subject at hand is not simple, which coincides with the complications mentioned in the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"It isn't simple\\" is logically entailed by the given premise \\"it's complicated,\\" as the notion of being complicated directly implies that something is not simple. The relationship between the two statements is such that the truth of one statement (the premise) immediately guarantees the truth of the other statement (the hypothesis), as they both essentially convey the same concept."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in either Spanish or English.

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Rooms are decorated with memorabilia and gifts, the original furniture and books, as well as honours and medals that Churchill received. Lady Churchill's long-time secretary, Grace Hamblin, was appointed the first administrator of the house. Earlier in her career, Miss Hamblin had undertaken the destruction of the portrait of Churchill painted by Graham Sutherland. The picture, a gift from both Houses of Parliament on Churchill's 80th birthday in 1954, was loathed by both Churchill and Lady Churchill and had been stored in the cellars at Chartwell before being burnt in secret.The opening of the house required the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built to the north of the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in the woodlands surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.Chartwell has become among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 visitors came to the house. In that year, the fiftieth anniversary of the house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M for the purchase of hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, \\"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values\\".

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Technology can be considered a good thing for several reasons, but it is important to recognize that both questions, while related, have subtle differences in their implications. Firstly, let us explore why technology is considered a good thing: 1. Efficiency and productivity: Technology has made significant contributions to various industries, allowing tasks to be completed more efficiently and accurately. It helps save time and resources, making businesses more productive and competitive. An example is the automation of repetitive tasks, which lowers human error and releases employees to focus on more strategic work. 2. Communication: The development and evolution of communication technologies have facilitated the exchange of information, ideas, and opinions on a global scale. From the invention of the printing press to the rise of social media platforms, technology has connected people from different parts of the world, promoting cross-cultural exchanges, and forging stronger relationships. 3. Healthcare advancements: Technological advancements in healthcare have significantly improved public health, extending life expectancies, and increasing the overall quality of life. Diagnostic tools, minimally invasive surgery techniques, and personalized medicine have all contributed to better patient outcomes. 4. Education and learning: The digital revolution has made information and learning resources more readily accessible than ever before. From online tutoring to massive open online courses (MOOCs), students can access educational material from the comfort of their homes, overcoming geographical and financial barriers. 5. Environmental benefits: Technological progress in renewable energy and clean technology is helping to reduce humanity's carbon footprint and protect the environment. Examples include solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles. 6. Creative expression: Technology provides new avenues for artistic expression, allowing creators to push boundaries and experiment with new media. Examples include digital music production, 3D animation, and virtual reality experiences. Now, let's address the differences between the two questions. Question 1: \\"Why is technology a good thing?\\" This question assumes that technology is inherently good and asks for reasons to support this assumption. The answer above provides an overview of some of the key reasons technology is considered beneficial. Question 2: \\"Is technology a good thing?\\" This question presents a more neutral stance, prompting a discussion of whether technology is, in fact, a good thing. While the benefits outlined underline the positive aspects of technology, it is equally important to consider the potential drawbacks. Some concerns include loss of privacy due to data collection, technological addiction, and the widening digital divide between those with access to technology and those without. In summary, although the questions are similar, their phrasing reflects different attitudes toward technology: one assuming its inherent goodness and the other probing for a more balanced perspective. Regardless, technology has undeniably provided numerous benefits to society, changing the way we live, work, and communicate. However, it is essential to address its potential drawbacks and mitigate any negative effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

All of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true. A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a piece of advice, \\"I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage,\\" she offered. \\"Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together.\\" The husband agreed. So each of them tried to think of the things that annoyed them about the other and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists. \\"I'll start,\\" offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes because he never thought that he had so many shortcomings. The wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. \\"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both of our lists,\\" she said happily. Quietly the husband stated, \\"I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect. I don't want you to change anything for me.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb's views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy. Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever. I like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters. Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, which he very much is. His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there. Speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad. Just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, that's just about all the character does. Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent. Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation. For someone who's been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he'd be more apt at emoting. Even though he doesn't show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled. And when he smothers Andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery. Marisa Tomei isn't given much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least. And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who's \\"perfect crime\\" of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. Hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain, but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother. Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH's great performance and it's family train wreck nature.

R.I.P. Metallica 1983 - 1988 Translation into English: Some kind of Bulls***. I am writing these lines while listening to Harvester of Sorrow from the Justice for all album and could kneel down in front of the ingeniousness of this song. But my enthusiasm quickly fades when I think of the people who once made quantum leaps as if it were the most natural thing in the world. When I read in an interview with James Hetfield in early 2003 that Metallica wanted to return to their roots, I became curious. Hetfield even said that they wanted to connect to the and Justice for all era and that the new album (St. Anger) would pick up where and Justice for all left off. To be honest, my euphoria rose to a new high that I have rarely experienced. But this time I was more cautious than with Load (which I bought blindly), this time I wanted to hear what the four guys had produced and it almost took my breath away. Not out of enthusiasm, but rather because of the shock of how low these former good musicians had sunk. From this point on, it was clear to me: Metallica are finally dead! When I watched the movie Some Kind of Monster, it became clear to me why Metallica can no longer achieve anything musically and are now just a bunch of unstable and aloof rock stars. R.I.P. Metallica 1983 - 1988 Sentiment Analysis: - The reviewer expresses initial admiration for a song from Metallica's Justice for All album. - The reviewer then shares their disappointment in how the band has changed and their dissatisfaction with the St. Anger album. - The review ends with the statement that Metallica is dead and a RIP message for the band. Based on the guidelines provided: Solution: The overall sentiment of the review is negative.

The opening sequence is one of George's daydreams as a spoof of the opening scene of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with George as Indiana Jones venturing to a temple to steal a gold Academy Award statue and being chased, run over and flattened by a giant boulder. Awaking from his daydream, George and his best friend and roommate Bob (David Bowe) are working at a Big Edna's Burger World, a local fast food eatery in the small Midwest town where they live. When George makes a disparaging remark about Big Edna and she hears it, both George and Bob are fired and litteraly thrown out onto the street.George's inablity to keep a steady job puts a strain on his long-suffering girlfriend Teri (Victoria Jackson) who tolerates his antics to a limit.

Some ties took as many as six matches to settle; in their 1975 campaign, Fulham played a total of 12 games over six rounds, which remains the most games played by a team to reach a final. Replays were traditionally played three or four days after the original game, but from 1991–92 they were staged at least 10 days later on police advice. This led to penalty shoot-outs being introduced, the first of which came on 26 November 1991 when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United. Q: Do clubs replay each other?","completion":"Yes, clubs in the FA Cup used to replay each other in case of a draw in earlier rounds of the competition. However, this practice has evolved over time. Until the 1990s, further replays would take place until one team emerged as the winner. This sometimes led to ties that required multiple matches in order to determine a single winner. For example, Fulham played a total of 12 games over six rounds in their 1975 campaign, which remained a record for the most games played by a team to reach a final. Replays were initially scheduled three or four days after the original game, but from the 1991-92 season, this changed, and replays were rescheduled to take place at least 10 days later, largely due to police advice. This shift eventually led to the introduction of penalty shoot-outs to decide the outcome of drawn matches in FA Cup ties, making replays less necessary. The first penalty shoot-out in FA Cup history occurred on 26 November 1991, when Rotherham United eliminated Scunthorpe United. Over time, the FA Cup has continued to evolve, and more recently, the Football Association has further reduced the number of replays in the competition. Starting from the 2016-17 season, quarter-final replays were abolished, and since the 2018-19 season, there have been no replays in the fifth round onward. This change aimed to help alleviate fixture congestion for clubs and ease the burden on players and teams throughout the season. As a result, only earlier rounds of the competition have replays in case of a draw, with drawn matches in later rounds now resolved via extra time and penalty shoot-outs if necessary."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It helps a preschooler : Develop social skills As children play pretend, they explore relationships between family members, friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact. Playing doctor, they imagine how physicians care for their patients. Playing house, they learn more about how parents feel about their children. Imaginative play helps develop empathy for others. If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet, they are better able to help those in need. They become more willing to play fair, to share, and to cooperate. Build selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives. Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a superhero defending the planet is empowering to a child. It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Boost intellectual growth Using the imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically . This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numerals symbolize groups of objects, letters symbolize sounds, and so on. Practice language skills Kids who play pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps _ their vocabulary, improve sentence structure and promote communication skills. Work out fears Playing pretend can help children work out their fears and worries. When children roleplay about the big, bad monster under the bed, they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad. Imaginative play also helps kids vent confusing feelings they might have, such as anger toward a parent or compete with a new sibling . To encourage your youngster's imagination, read to him every day. Books offer children the opportunity to visit other worlds and create new ones of their own. For generations children have enjoyed reading the story... Answer:","completion":"What is one benefit of imaginative play for preschoolers discussed in the article?

Our respiratory process, as described above, consists of several stages, from air entering our nostrils or mouth, passing through the windpipe, flowing into our lungs and alveoli, and finally, oxygen being absorbed by our blood and transported to the heart. The heart then pumps the oxygen-rich blood throughout our body. After oxygen is utilized by cells, they release carbon dioxide-rich blood, which is then carried back to the lungs to be exhaled. Bat senses, specifically their echolocation ability, are an entirely separate system from the process of respiration in humans or any other mammals. Echolocation allows bats to navigate their environment by emitting high-frequency sounds and listening for any returning echoes created by the sound waves bouncing off objects. This unique capability enables bats to avoid obstacles, locate food, and communicate with other members of their species effectively. If a supernatural event were to occur and activate bat senses, it would not have any impact on the amount of oxygen produced or how we utilize it. The respiratory process would continue to function as it does, regardless of any changes or enhancements in bat senses caused by the supernatural event. In conclusion, the activation of bat senses by a supernatural event would have no effect on oxygen production or utilization by humans or other organisms. The respiratory process would continue to function independently, providing our bodies with the necessary oxygen needed for cellular activity and maintaining overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who meet Francis on the train? from the following article ? When Ella Finch and her sister Kate inherit 30,000 each just after the end of World War I, Ella becomes dissatisfied with her dull life in South Bend, Indiana, and with Kate's butcher boyfriend Willis. She is convinced she can rectify both problems by taking Kate to New York City. Her wisecracking cigar salesman husband Ernie is unable to change her mind, so he reluctantly goes along, postponing a promotion at work by claiming to his boss, A. J. Gluskoter, that his wife is sick and needs a stay at a sanitarium. On the train, they meet New Yorker Francis Griffin. Ernie is less impressed with him than his wife and sister-in-law. In New York, Ella helps Katie try to win over Francis, but it turns out that he is actually infatuated with Ella. She has to punch him to fend off his unexpected advances. Ernie shows up later and knocks him down too. Ella then rents an apartment. Ella meets their wealthy neighbor, Lucius Trumball, who invites them all over for drinks. Ella is delighted, but Kate is not pleased when she discovers that Trumball is much older than her. Later she finds out he is also married when his wife returns unexpectedly from Timbuktu. They return to the hotel they stayed at before, where they meet Herbert Daley, who owns race horses. At the track, Daley persuades them to bet on his horse. It wins, but then Daley's jockey, Sid Mercer, shows interest in Kate, much to Daley's annoyance. Kate secretly sees Sid while also going to the track with Daley with Ella and Ernie. Daley returns early from a trip and catches Sid kissing Kate, but Kate assures him there is nothing serious going on, and they become engaged.
