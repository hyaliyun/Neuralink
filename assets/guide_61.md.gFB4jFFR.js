Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Elizabeth Kocianski was born in Elmira, New York and raised by Polish parents. When she was eleven years old, she won a coloring contest with a prize of tickets to a television taping for the World Wrestling Federation. Kocianski credits this as when she fell in love with professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. On the July 9, 2007, episode of Raw, Phoenix returned as a villain, when Melina claimed to be injured. Phoenix replaced Melina in a tag team match as Jillian Hall's partner, and the two lost to Candice Michelle and Mickie James. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view, Phoenix won the Interpromotional Divas battle royal to become the number one contender for Michelle's WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix was then pushed as a dominating Diva, dubbing herself \\"The Glamazon\\" and attacking James, Hall, and Michelle on the September 10 episode of Raw. At Unforgiven, however, she failed to capture the Women's Championship from Michelle. Their storyline rivalry continued when Phoenix pinned Michelle during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No Mercy in October, Phoenix defeated Michelle to win her first WWE Women's Championship. She retained the title on the October 22 episode of Raw in a two out of three falls match, in which Candice Michelle was injured by Phoenix shaking the rope, causing her to fall off the top turnbuckle and legitimately break her clavicle. During a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, Phoenix's team lost after Melina was pinned by Mickie James. On the November 26 episode of Raw, James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Phoenix's Women's Championship, setting up a title match between the two at Armageddon, a match in which Phoenix successfully defended her Women's title. On New Year's Eve 2007, Phoenix successfully defended her title in a Triple Threat match against Melina and James, after pinning Melina. Phoenix, along with then-ally Melina, took part in the Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match at WrestleMania XXIV, where she defeated the team of Ashley and Maria. On April 14, 2008 Phoenix faced Mickie James with her Women's Championship on the line and lost, ending her reign as champion. Phoenix received a rematch on the May 5 episode of Raw in a lumberjill match, but lost after Melina unintentionally hit her in the face with her boot. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Melina and Phoenix partnered to face Maria and James. During the match, Melina unintentionally knocked Phoenix off of the ring apron, resulting in Phoenix abandoning Melina, which allowed James and Maria to pick up the win. Later that night, Melina and Phoenix brawled in a backstage segment, ending their alliance. At Judgment Day, Phoenix failed to regain the Women's Championship in a Triple Threat match after James pinned Melina to retain the title. At One Night Stand, Phoenix defeated Melina in the first women's \\"I Quit\\" match in WWE history. The next night on Raw, Phoenix teamed with Katie Lea Burchill to defeat Melina and James in a tag team match.

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

The company that sponsors the Thanksgiving Day Parade is the well-known and highly regarded American department store chain Macy's. The parade is officially called the \\"Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\\" and takes place annually in New York City. Since its inception in 1924, the parade has grown to become one of the most enduring and iconic Thanksgiving traditions in the United States. The origins of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade can be traced back to the early 1920s when a group of Macy's store employees, many of whom were immigrants, wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving in the spirit of the festivals they had back in their home countries. The first parade featured live animals from the Central Park Zoo, but the balloon characters that the parade is famous for today were introduced a few years later, in 1927. Held on Thanksgiving Day, the parade commences at 9:00 AM and makes its way through Manhattan, attracting approximately 3.5 million spectators along the 2.5-mile parade route and an estimated 50 million viewers nationwide on television. The parade is renowned for its large helium balloons featuring popular character and balloonicles, which are a fusion of a cold-air balloon and a self-powered vehicle that rolls down the route. Additionally, there are floats with various themes, celebrities, marching bands, clowns, and dance performances. In summary, the company that sponsors the Thanksgiving Day Parade is Macy's, a prominent American department store chain, and the parade has become an integral part of the Thanksgiving celebration in the United States."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Justice League, with Cyborg's assistance, stop the Royal Flush Gang's attempted robery of a diamond vault using complex technology that allows them to pass through solid objects. Meanwhile, Vandal Savage plots to exterminate the greater part of the human population and start a new civilization; he discreetly gave the technology to the Gang for testing purposes. To ensure the Justice League cannot stop him, Savage hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman to incapacitate his League teammates, in case they go rogue. Savage assembles Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, who all have personal vendettas against the heroes and pays them to simultaneously attack using the stolen plans, albeit altered to be lethal. When the supervillains agree, he welcomes them to the Legion of Doom. The villains each do their part to take out each member of the Justice League: Batman, as Bruce Wayne, is informed by Alfred Pennyworth that the bodies of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been exhumed and are missing. At his parents' graves, Bruce is ambushed by Bane, who gains the upper hand and renders Bruce unconscious. Bruce is buried alive in his father's coffin; he is left a tape recorder with a message from Bane taunting him, which motivates him to break out of the coffin. He realizes that the League has been attacked using his contingency plans, which were constructed from studying physical and psychological weaknesses in the event the League went to the other side or succumbed to mind control. With Cyborg's help, he saves his teammates one by one. Wonder Woman is attacked by Cheetah with a scratch that sends nanomachines into her bloodstream.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Justice League: Doom,\\" it is the Royal Flush Gang that is stopped by Batman and the rest of the Justice League from a robbery at a diamond vault. The Royal Flush Gang was using complex technology that allowed them to pass through solid objects, which was discreetly provided to them by Vandal Savage for testing purposes. Vandal Savage is the main antagonist of the movie, plotting to exterminate a significant part of the human population and start a new civilization. To prevent the Justice League from stopping him, he hires Mirror Master to hack into the Batcomputer and steal contingency plans devised by Batman in case any of his teammates go rogue. Vandal Savage then assembles a team of supervillains, all of whom have personal vendettas against the heroes, and pays them to attack the Justice League members using the stolen plans, but alters them to become lethal. The villains in this team are Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Ma'alefa'ak, Star Sapphire, and Metallo, and they form the Legion of Doom. The villains each attack and incapacitate the members of the Justice League, using the weaknesses and contingency plans designed by Batman. However, Batman, with the help of Cyborg, manages to save his teammates one by one. Together, they work to stop Vandal Savage's sinister plot and save humanity. In conclusion, the movie \\"Justice League: Doom\\" revolves around the efforts of the Legion of Doom, led by Vandal Savage, to take down the Justice League using their weaknesses. The Royal Flush Gang, stopped by Batman and the Justice League, was only a small part of Vandal Savage's grand plan. When deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, consider the potential audience, market trends, and its engaging plot that explores the depths of each Justice League member's weaknesses and their ability to overcome them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From the Abominable Snowman to the Loch Ness Monster, there's no shortage of mythical creatures rumoured to walk the Earth - and no shortage of people convinced they truly do exist. But few legendary beast aficionados are as committed as those dedicated to Bigfoot, with legions of hunters from Texas to Oregon dedicated to tracking down Sasquatch. Among them are Rick Dyer, a hunter from Georgia, and Las Vegas entrepreneur Tom Biscadi - both of whom say they are the man to uncover the truth about the mythical monster. The A-team: Las Vegas Bigfoot expert Tom Biscardi with his crack team of Sasquatch hunters. Found it? Rick Dyer has claimed to have tracked Bigfoot down not once but twice. Now a new BBC documentary, Shooting Bigfoot, has delved into their often bizarre world where conspiracy theorists and unscheduled falls in the river are all part of the job. But while the men are convinced, not everyone agrees, among them the mother of Rick's daughter Audrey. And the fact she's not convinced is partly down to Rick himself, who in 2008 claimed to have found Bigfoot but was soon revealed to have found nothing more than a Sasquatch costume that he had filled with possum roadkill. 'I hurt a lot of people in 2008 with the. hoax,' he admits, 'a lot of true believers, and I'd like to redeem myself and show. that I'm the real deal.' In a bid to prove it, he's travelled to Texas where reports from San Antonio say that a homeless person encountered the beast while sleeping rough in the woods. 'Some homeless people called it in and. three motorists called it in, and then I came up here and across this. path, I saw it,' says Rick. 'I'm not going to tell you how tall it is because I don't. know but it was a hairy upright creature and when I saw it, my heart. dropped. 'I am 100 per cent in no doubt that there is a Bigfoot and. that there is a Bigfoot right here.' But while Rick is dedicated to the pursuit of Sasquatch, his six years in the game make him a novice compared to Biscardi, who has spent 37 years hunting Bigfoot. 'I've seen the creature with my own eyes,' he reveals. 'I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out. 'I made a dedication to. myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because. I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.' Hoax: Dyer's 2008 'discovery' turned out to be a Sasquatch costume filled with dead possums. The real deal? A computer generated image showing what the primate-like Bigfoot might actually look like. Famous: A still from the 1972 Patterson-Gimlin film purporting to show Bigfoot. Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters. Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist. When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3. It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a. Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto. zoologist,' he complains. 'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel. and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or. you'll never find anything.' While Rick might call himself a Bigfoot hunter, he says that he too is the real deal. 'God has sent me something to say \\"Look,. there is a Bigfoot, be committed now.\\" Rather menacingly, he continues: 'Unfortunately for the Bigfoot,. I'm going to have to kill it. If there is someone out here in a costume,. they will be dead soon because I'm going to kill them.' So does Bigfoot really exist? Biscardi is convinced that the primate prints he finds come from a juvenile Sasquatch while Rick goes public with claims that yet again, he has managed to shoot and kill Bigfoot - and has the corpse to prove it. 'Growing up I thought I'd be a cowboy,' adds Rick, 'but I gave it up for the same reason that you don't. pursue a lot of your little pipe dreams. 'This is not a pipe dream - a. pipe dream is something you can't achieve.' Storyville: Shooting Bigfoot, tonight at 10pm on BBC4.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

In Michaelmas 1836, Ruskin matriculated at the University of Oxford, taking up residence at Christ Church in January of the following year. Enrolled as a gentleman-commoner, he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. His study of classical \\"Greats\\" might, his parents hoped, lead him to take Holy Orders and become a bishop, perhaps even the Archbishop of Canterbury. Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, Henry Liddell (later the father of Alice Liddell) and a private tutor, the Rev Osborne Gordon. He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, William Buckland. Among Ruskin's fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were Charles Thomas Newton and Henry Acland. His biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious Newdigate Prize for poetry (Arthur Hugh Clough came second). He met William Wordsworth, who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adele Domecq, second daughter of his father's business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford. Before he returned, he answered a challenge set down by Effie Gray, whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798-1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, The King of the Golden River (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works. At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

Which is likely less dense diamond or ball? Text: A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided text, we can determine which of the two, the diamond or the beach ball, is likely less dense by understanding the relationship between density, mass, and volume. The text states that \\"a given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance.\\" This indicates that density is a measure of how much mass is found within a certain volume of a substance. Now, let's compare the diamond's mass and volume to that of the beach ball. A diamond is a crystalline form of carbon and has a high density due to its tightly packed carbon atoms. Meanwhile, a beach ball is generally made of lightweight, flexible, and inflatable materials, such as plastic or vinyl. This makes the beach ball significantly lighter and less dense than a solid object of the same size, such as a diamond. However, the question states that John's diamond is the same size as the beach ball, which means their volumes are essentially equal. Since the diamond is a much denser material than the beach ball, its mass for the given volume would be much greater than the mass of the beach ball. Considering the relationship between density, mass, and volume, as well as the properties of both a diamond and a beach ball, it is safe to conclude that the beach ball is likely less dense than the diamond. The diamond, owing to its tightly packed carbon atoms, would have a greater mass within the same volume, thereby making it a denser substance in comparison to the beach ball's lightweight, inflatable material composition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish channel, which will receive £19m new cash and have a nightly 21:00 news show, has prompted criticism from Welsh politicians. The announcement came after the BBC said it was investing an extra £8.5m a year in Welsh TV programmes - short of the £30m demanded by politicians. BBC Wales said the needs of viewers in Scotland were \\"different\\". Tory AM Darren Millar tweeted that it made the funding for Wales look like an \\"insult\\", while Labour shadow culture minister Kevin Brennan said it seemed that BBC Wales was \\"being short-changed compared to Scotland\\". Under the Welsh package announced on Tuesday, the BBC said it would invest an extra £8.5m a year in English-language television programmes for Wales. The BBC said the investment was a 50% increase and would fund new drama, comedy and entertainment programmes. Bethan Jenkins, assembly culture committee chair and a Plaid Cymru AM, said she did not want to begrudge the Welsh deal but said different nations would \\"feel rightly aggrieved\\" at the different levels of investment. Ms Jenkins' culture committee called for £30m extra to be spent on BBC English-language drama and broadcasting earlier this month. Suzy Davies, Conservative AM for South Wales West and also a committee member, described the \\"sheer imbalance\\" as an \\"affront to Wales' journalists and to licence-fee payers\\". But Alun Davies, Minister for Lifelong Learning and Welsh Language who has policy responsibility for broadcasting, said the creation of a separate channel would not answer the needs of Wales. \\"A separate channel with tiny audiences will not bridge the current information deficit,\\" he said. \\"We need a comprehensive service on all of the BBC's existing channels and outlets which meet Wales' needs in news, sport and culture.\\" Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Wales director Mr Davies said the Welsh funding deal was a substantial settlement and said political pressure played its part in both nations. \\"There will be an announcement in due course about how the £8.5m will be spent. I do not spend my time comparing directly with what is happening in Scotland,\\" he said. \\"In Wales, we have intentionally chosen to spend the money on BBC One and BBC Two. \\"We know through engaging with the audience that those are the channels where they want to see Wales being reflected.\\" A spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said: \\"Wales is being treated disgracefully, as there are no apparent plans for a similar channel or investment here. \\"We call on BBC Cymru Wales to revisit the package announced yesterday and return with more imaginative and far-reaching proposals, similar to the ones being planned for Scotland.\\" A BBC spokeswoman said \\"the needs of audience in Scotland are different\\" and \\"as a result, different choices have been made that then require different levels of funding\\".

Juan Carlos was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona and Princess Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in Rome, Italy, where his grandfather, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and other members of the Spanish Royal Family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso Victor Maria de Borbon y Borbon-Dos Sicilias. He was given the name Juan Carlos after his father and maternal grandfather, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. On the evening of Holy Thursday, 29 March 1956, Juan Carlos's younger brother Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family's home Villa Giralda in Estoril, Portugal. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal then issued the following official communique: Whilst His Highness Prince Alfonso was cleaning a revolver last evening with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes. The accident took place at 20.30 hours, after the Infante's return from the Maundy Thursday religious service, during which he had received holy communion. Alfonso had won a local junior golf tournament earlier in the day, then went to evening Mass and rushed up to the room to see Juan Carlos who had come home for the Easter holidays from military school. It is alleged that Juan Carlos began playing with a gun that had apparently been given to Alfonso by General Franco. Rumors appeared in newspapers that the gun had actually been held by Juan Carlos at the moment the shot was fired. As they were alone in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot, but according to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that it was loaded.

Help as much as you can. Two villages were focused mostly on mining operation. Brown village extracted fossil fuels such as coal from their mountains, while Yellow village was mostly focused on extracting gold the old fashioned way. Which village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature? Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. A:","completion":"Brown Village has more of an impact on Earth's temperature. This is because they extract and presumably burn fossil fuels such as coal, which releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We know from the hint provided that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. On the other hand, Yellow Village extracts gold, which doesn't impact the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels directly, so their effect on Earth's temperature is negligible compared to that of Brown Village."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these two questions, I will research each topic separately and provide information to address the questions. Then, I will evaluate if the answers are the same or different. Step 1: Research types of suspensions used in automobiles: Suspension systems in automobiles are essential for maintaining stability, comfort, and control while driving. There are several types of suspensions used in automobiles. Some common types include: 1. Independent suspension: This type of suspension allows each wheel to move independently, providing better handling and ride quality. Examples of independent suspension systems are: a. MacPherson Strut b. Double Wishbone c. Multi-link 2. Dependent suspension: In this system, the movement of one wheel affects the movement of the other wheel on the same axle. Examples of dependent suspension systems are: a. Solid axle b. Beam axle c. Leaf spring Step 2: Research why pressed steel is used in automobile frames: Pressed steel is used in automobile frames due to its various advantages. Some reasons why pressed steel is preferred: 1. Cost-effectiveness: Pressed steel is relatively inexpensive compared to other materials, making it an economical choice for mass-produced automobiles. 2. Lightweight: Pressed steel is lighter than some other alternatives, contributing to better fuel efficiency and improved performance. 3. Strength and durability: Due to its manufacturing process, pressed steel is strong and provides the necessary support for the vehicle's body. 4. Flexibility in design: Pressed steel allows for flexibility in design, as it can be shaped into various forms required for automobile frames. Step 3: Evaluate if the answers are the same or different: The answers to the two questions are different. - Question 1 focuses on the types of suspension systems used in automobiles, which are essential for vehicle stability, comfort, and control. - Question 2 focuses on why pressed steel is used in automobile frames, discussing the advantages of using pressed steel in terms of cost, weight, strength, and flexibility in design.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence. Megan called to invite Amy to a barbecue during the holiday weekend as Options: 1). Megan knew everyone in the small town.. 2). Amy knew everyone in the small town..","completion":"Megan called to invite Amy to a barbecue during the holiday weekend as Amy knew everyone in the small town, and her presence would not only help to create a more relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, but also ensure that all the guests would feel comfortable attending the gathering. Additionally, Amy had an incredible ability to engage with people and make them feel at ease, a trait that would certainly come in handy as the barbecue was expected to be a melting pot of diverse personalities and backgrounds. As a well-known and well-liked figure within the community, Amy had built a strong network of connections and friendships over the years, making her the perfect unofficial ambassador for the event. She had lived in the small town for her entire life and had come to know the ins and outs of town politics, local gossip, and important or exciting town events. Her familiarity with the townspeople would ensure that the barbecue was a fun and memorable occasion for everyone involved. Megan on the other hand, although having lived in the town for some time now, hadn't managed to establish as deep connections as Amy, especially after being frequently occupied with work and family commitments. This only fueled her eagerness in inviting Amy, with the hope that she could learn a thing or two from her innate social skills. Another rationale behind Megan inviting Amy was her capacity to get people together and create a sense of unity. Given that the holiday weekend was a time for families and friends to rejoice and share memorable experiences, Amy was undoubtedly the perfect person to have around, helping foster a sense of togetherness and camaraderie among the attendees. Megan was confident that if Amy could make it to her barbecue, she would be able to create the ideal environment in which people could converse openly, laugh wholeheartedly, and enjoy each other's company. Thus, as Amy knew everyone in the small town, her inclusion in the event was truly indispensable, and Megan was excited to have her by her side during the holiday weekend barbecue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Kelendria Trene Rowland was born on February 11, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the daughter of Doris Rowland Garrison (December 6, 1947 - December 2, 2014) and Christopher Lovett. Kelly has an older brother named Orlando. When she was six, her mother took her and left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic. Taken from a passage in the Biblical Book of Isaiah, the group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1993. Together, they performed in local events and, after four years on the road, the group was signed to Columbia Records in late 1997. That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label debut song \\"Killing Time\\", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, spawning hits such as \\"No, No, No\\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards. The group rose to fame after releasing their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The album featured some of the group's most widely known songs such as \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", \\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\" and \\"Say My Name\\", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain as one of their signature songs. \\"Say My Name\\" won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, essentially becoming their breakthrough album. Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. The issue was heightened after Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared in the video of \\"Say My Name\\", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced. Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months, as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the departure. After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded \\"Independent Women Part I\\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks. The success cemented the new lineup and skyrocketed them to fame. Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging. Later that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album Survivor, Rowland appeared on the remix of Avant's single \\"Separated\\". Survivor, which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its lead single of the same name, which was a response to the experience. The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The themes of \\"Survivor\\", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002. Meanwhile, the album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. To date, Survivor has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone. The album also spawned the number-one hit \\"Bootylicious\\". After releasing their remix album This Is the Remix in 2002, the group announced their temporary break-up to pursue solo projects. In January 2013, Destiny's Child released a compilation album entitled Love Songs, a collection of romance-themed songs from their previous albums and newly recorded song \\"Nuclear\\".

Later that month, Rowland performed as a supporting headlining act at the RiverFest 2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rowland embarked on the Lights Out Tour, a co-headlining tour with The-Dream, to promote her fourth studio album Talk a Good Game. Formerly titled Year of the Woman, the album was released on June 18, 2013 in the US. It is Rowland's first release with Republic Records following Universal Music Group's decision to close Universal Motown and Universal Republic, and reviving Motown Records and Republic Records. Talk a Good Game sold 68,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, becoming Rowland's third top-ten album in the US. The album's lead single \\"Kisses Down Low\\" was a moderate success on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was certified gold by RIAA for exceeded 500,000 copies sold. The second and final single \\"Dirty Laundry\\" was acclaimed by critics for its lyrical and the emotional honesty. In December 2013, Rowland appeared in Beyonce's \\"Grown Woman\\" music video and alongside Williams in Beyonce's \\"Superpower\\" music video and provided backing vocals on the same track, taken from her self-titled fifth studio album. In February 2014, Rowland was featured on Joe's single \\"Love & Sex Part 2\\". In March 2014, she was named a spokesperson for cosmetic company, Caress. During an interview with HuffPost Live on March 26, 2014, Rowland revealed that she has begun recording her fifth studio album and said the new music, which encompasses horns, drums, and flutes, was influenced by iconic female singers including Diana Ross. Rowland also announced in the interview that she left Republic Records, adding that she \\"just needed a fresh, new start.\\" In June 2014, Rowland and Beyonce were featured on Williams' single \\"Say Yes\\". The same month, her song \\"The Game\\" and its music video appeared on Pepsi's visual album for the 2014 FIFA World Cup titled, Beats of the Beautiful Game. On July 19, 2014, Rowland was featured on Adrian Marcel's song \\"Honey\\" from his mixtape Weak After Next and on Beau Vallis's song \\"Love Stand Still\\".

In August 2015, she was featured on Jacob Whitesides's single \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\". Rowland was part of the recurring cast of the second season of the American drama television series Empire. She played Leah Walker, Lucious Lyon's mother, in flashbacks and starred in five episodes. She recorded a song for the show called \\"Mona Lisa\\" which was included on the EP Empire: Music from \\"Be True\\", released on October 21, 2015. On October 26, 2015, Rowland released a new song titled \\"Dumb\\" which is rumoured to appear on her upcoming fifth album. Rowland's new record does not have a release date yet. Rowland along with Missy Elliott, Kelly Clarkson, Zendaya, Janelle Monae, Lea Michele and Chloe & Halle, were all featured on a charity single put together by US First Lady Michelle Obama. \\"This Is For My Girls\\" was written by Diane Warren and was released on March 15, 2016. The song was created to raise funds and awareness towards Obama's \\"Let Girls Learn\\" initiative - aimed at boosting education rates amongst adolescent girls around the world who are denied the right to an education The iTunes-exclusive record was used to both coincide with Obama's Texan SXSW speech and to promote the \\"Let Girls Learn\\" initiative. The following month, Rowland hosted BET's docu-series Chasing Destiny, where she and choreographer/director Frank Gatson Jr. searched to find the next superstars for an all female group. They eventually formed the girl group June's Diary. On 24 December 2016, it was announced that Rowland would replace Jessie J as a coach on the sixth season of The Voice Australia, that aired in early 2017. Rowland played the role of Margot Scotts in the television film Love By the 10th Date, which premiered on Lifetime on January 28, 2017.

Determine which string, A or B, is longer: A = \\"ErcFFjUfqSsmrGqfLxaCIQplseygBsRE\\" B = \\"gPbCSsmrGqfLxaCIeNbAxiy\\" Length of A = 33 Length of B = 22 Since the length of A is greater than the length of B, we will proceed with string A. 2.

Extract all unique alphabets used in the converted string: We will now find all distinct characters in the lowercase string A. A set data structure can help us remove duplicate characters.

Context: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

Upon examination and x-rays, there was no sign of fracture or endodontic lesion and the tooth was vital on pulp testing.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.

In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", neither author admitted to borrowing from Thespis for later works. A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What work's entrance chorus fit the situation almost exactly?\\" from the given article is the entrance chorus from \\"Thespis.\\" It was found to fit the situation almost exactly and was thus substituted in Gilbert and Sullivan's opera \\"The Pirates of Penzance\\" when Sullivan accidentally left his original sketches behind in England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Teach your fish to follow your finger. Train your betta to flare on command. Teach your betta to jump. Train your betta to swim through a hoop. Keep trying! Article:","completion":"Title: The Exciting World of Betta Training: Follow, Flare, Jump, and Swim! Intro A common misconception with fish as pets is the limited interaction humans can have with them. They swim in their aquarium, eat their food, and generally live their life with confined spontaneity. But what if that perception can change? Especially when it comes to betta fish, there's definitely more to them than meets the eye! Today, we're going to learn how to train a betta to follow your finger, flare on command, jump, and even swim through a hoop. Keep trying because persistence pays off! Teaching Your Betta to Follow Your Finger Training a betta to follow your finger sounds somewhat incredulous, but it's possible! Betta fish are very curious creatures who are stimulated by external changes to their environment, therefore, following your finger can pose as an intriguing challenge. Start by placing your clean finger on the outer part of the tank. Catch your betta's attention, then slowly move your finger around. Initially, they might not engage, but patience is key here. Reward your betta with food when it starts following your finger. This process conditions the fish to associate your finger with positive consequences (food!) and thus motivates them to keep following. Inculcating the Flare-on-Command Skill The flaring technique in betta fish is a spectacle to behold. In the wild, betta fish flare their gills to intimidate competitors. By replicating their environment, we can teach them to flare on command. Initially, train your betta to flare by introducing a mirror into their tank for short periods. The reflection will prompt a defensive response, causing them to flare. After several times, your betta should associate flaring with the mirror. Then, combine the mirror exposure with a unique hand signal. Over time, your fish will learn to flare at the sight of your unique hand signal, even without the mirror. Jumping Out of the Water While it might seem a little unconventional, bettas can indeed be taught to jump. In their natural habitat, bettas sometimes leap out of the water to catch prey. With enough patience and the correct training approach, your pet betta can learn to do this on command. Start by hovering a feed pellet just beyond the water surface. As your betta gets used to reaching for it, gradually elevate the pellet higher each time. Soon, your betta will jump to get its meal. Pair this action with a verbal command or a specific hand gesture, and with consistent practice, your fish will jump at your command. Swimming Through a Hoop Swimming through a hoop is another fun activity for your betta. Not only does it provide mental stimulation, but it is also an impressive party trick! Start with a soft, flexible hoop that's large enough for your betta to swim through. Place it just under the water surface. Entice them to pass through with food if needed. Once they get comfortable, gradually lower the hoop deeper into the water. Regular consistency with this training can make your betta master this skill in no time. In conclusion, a betta fish’s potential for interaction goes beyond just swimming around the tank. They are intelligent creatures capable of performing exciting and endearing tricks. Remember, patience and persistence are crucial in training your betta. So relax, take a deep breath, and keep trying! Betta training welcomes you to a world where your fish can follow your finger, flare on command, jump, and swim through a hoop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"EULEX is attempting to reach an agreement with Pristina and Belgrade; I hope that a quick solution can be found for this situation. EULEX (European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo) is a European Union civilian mission that aims to help strengthen the rule of law and judicial independence in Kosovo. In this context, it is working to establish a mutual agreement between Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, in order to resolve any ongoing or potential disputes between these two entities. Given the long history of political tensions and conflicts between Kosovo and Serbia, reaching a comprehensive and lasting agreement is a challenging task for all parties involved. The main objective of EULEX's engagement in this process is to foster dialogue and cooperation between the two capitals, as well as to support the institutions of Kosovo in their efforts to enforce the rule of law and improve the overall legal framework. In order to achieve these goals, EULEX carries out several tasks, including providing expertise and technical assistance, monitoring and advising on legal proceedings, and facilitating training for local authorities and legal professionals. Through these actions, EULEX contributes not only to the development of a well-functioning judicial system in Kosovo but also to the broader efforts towards reconciliation and regional stability in the Western Balkans. However, there are numerous obstacles in the way of a swift and effective resolution of the situation between Pristina and Belgrade. These challenges include deeply rooted historical grievances, differences in political stances and objectives, and ongoing issues impacting the daily lives of people on both sides of the border. Some of the most pressing concerns involve disputes over territory, national identity, and the rights of minority populations, as well as the implementation of already agreed-upon arrangements and regulations. Despite these difficulties, the involvement of EULEX in the negotiation process between Pristina and Belgrade is crucial in ensuring that progress is made towards a mutually beneficial and peaceful resolution. By actively engaging both parties in constructive dialogue, identifying common ground, and creating an environment conducive to compromise, the prospects for a successful outcome can be significantly improved. In sum, EULEX's efforts to reach an agreement with Pristina and Belgrade are vital for facilitating a swift and effective resolution of the ongoing situation between Kosovo and Serbia. Through continued dialogue, cooperation, and the provision of support in enforcing the rule of law, the mission seeks to promote lasting peace and stability in the region, ultimately benefiting the lives of the people on both sides of the border."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6-1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6-5 (after being 1-4 down), Alan McManus 6-3 and Michael Holt 6-4 to reach the venue stage for the first time. He made four century breaks during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4-1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2-4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit.

A recent tweet by an astrophysicist commemorating the birthday of Sir Isaac Newton on December 25 has caused quite a stir among the Twitterati and has since been retweeted more than 70,000 times. This astrophysicist took to Twitter to pay tribute to the legendary mathematician and physicist, Sir Isaac Newton, whose birthday falls on December 25th. The tweet was intended as a simple gesture of appreciation and recognition for one of the most influential figures in the history of science. However, it fueled an unexpected debate that led some people to accuse the astrophysicist of \\"trolling Christmas to show how smart he is.\\" These accusations were met with a sense of surprise and bewilderment by the astrophysicist. He clarified that his intention was not to be \\"somehow anti-Christian\\" by mentioning Newton's birthday on a day that carries great significance for millions of people all around the world. The purpose of his tweet was definitely not to downplay the importance of Christmas, but rather to highlight the incredible contributions of Isaac Newton to our understanding of the natural world. Responding to the unexpected reactions to his tweet, the astrophysicist shared his thoughts in another tweet: \\"Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them.\\" This statement, in essence, underlines the importance of recognizing and appreciating objective truths without allowing our emotions to cloud our judgments. At its core, the incident serves as an interesting reflection on the way we perceive information and interact with it in our increasingly connected world. The exchange of thoughts and ideas on social media platforms has undoubtedly made it easier for us to stay informed and learn new things. However, it also carries the risk of triggering emotional responses and misunderstandings, which can lead to unnecessary controversy. Moreover, this entire episode highlights the significance of promoting scientific literacy and critical thinking in our modern, digital society. By fostering a deeper understanding of the world around us, we can prevent the spread of misinformation, reduce emotional reactions, and better appreciate the value of objective truths. It is crucial to remember that the progress of human civilization has been fueled by the contributions of great minds, like Isaac Newton, who relentlessly pursued knowledge and pushed the boundaries of our understanding. Celebrating their accomplishments does not necessitate disrespecting or undermining anyone's beliefs or religious practices. In conclusion, the astrophysicist's tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton on December 25 should ideally be seen as an opportunity to appreciate the achievements of one of the most prominent scientific luminaries in history. This incident serves as a reminder that we must strive to create a world where objective truths are valued and acknowledged without being overshadowed by emotional responses or misunderstandings, thus promoting harmony and mutual respect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shootouts, kidnappings and carjackings have climbed, as have cartels, also known as transnational criminal organizations (TCO), the State Department said this week in a broadened travel warning. While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico every year, the country's ongoing violence and security concerns pose risks for U.S. citizens, and travelers should take precautions, the State Department advises. \\"The TCOs themselves are engaged in a violent struggle to control drug trafficking routes and other criminal activity. As a result, crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere.

More than 47,500 people were killed in drug-related violence in Mexico between December 2006 and September 2011, according to the State Department. While most of those murdered were involved in criminal activity, innocent people were also caught in the crossfire, the State Department said.

The police arrive at the apartment in time only to discover a woman (Jasmina Ilic) sprawled on the floor with her throat sliced open and the corpse of her daughter (Teodora Uveric) stuffed in the chimney. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in the short story The Murders in the Rue Morgue, which is part of a collection of stories penned by the writer Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusak).Poe has become a social pariah and penniless drunkard whose stories have not been circulated for some time. He has fallen in love with the beautiful young Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) and desires to marry her but faces opposition from her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), a military man who loathes Poe and goes to the length of threatening physical violence. Poe is brought to see Fields for questioning and is horrified to learn someone is using his stories as the backdrop for a series of murders. Fields then proposes that Poe volunteer his services to help the police catch the killer and Poe agrees to the task.The two men are called to investigate the murder of literary critic Rufus Griswold (John Warnaby), the man who became Poe's rival after a feud that was published in the Baltimore newspapers.

HM Revenue chiefs were yesterday ordered by MPs to stop sending threatening letters to people who owed them money, warning that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off for a pittance. In a scathing rebuke, tax bosses were told by the Commons' Treasury committee that the 'widely used' practice of mailing out threats to auction off people's property was 'completely inappropriate'. Labour MP George Mudie, deputy chairman of the committee, even suggested that HM Revenue and Customs had been breaking the law by sending out the 'horrifying' letters. 'Horrifying threats': HM Revenue has been sending out letters to people threatening to auction off their property. And he accused Chancellor George Osborne of turning a blind eye to the abuse after one of his Treasury Ministers appeared to condone it. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how the tax office was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a damning report this weekend on HMRC's performance, the Treasury committee said: 'These letters appear to have been widely used without sufficient thought to whom they were sent to, even being sent to people who did not actually owe money. 'Such language is appropriate only where there is strong evidence of persistent and deliberate non-payment.' Mr Mudie, who led the inquiry, praised The Mail on Sunday for exposing the HMRC tactics. He said: 'This was one of the most disturbing things uncovered in our inquiry. They were sending these out to taxpayers, seemingly on a random basis, and telling them to pay up within weeks. 'There was no question of saying we would like to discuss this with you, or you can phone this number, and you have a right of appeal. 'It was just: pay up this money – and it was often a four-figure number – within weeks or we will seize your goods. 'Imagine the effect on someone elderly and vulnerable living on their own if they got a letter like that.' 'Disappointing': Treasury Minister David Gauke was on the receiving end of stern criticism from the committee. The Leeds MP also warned that unless the letters were being sent to people who had repeatedly and deliberately refused to pay up, they were illegal. He also voiced his anger that Treasury Minister David Gauke, who oversees HMRC, appeared to condone the practice. Mr Mudie said: 'The Minister came before us and I was disappointed because he took the line that they owed money and they had to get it. 'He seemed to think it was acceptable but the committee didn't.' Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday exposed how HMRC was targeting thousands of people among Britain's ten million self-assessment taxpayers who had failed to respond to tax demands. In a provocative twin-track tactic, tax chiefs set out to humiliate people into paying up by threatening to seize their possessions and auction them off publicly for a fraction of their real value, and warning them that if they refused the Government would run out of money to treat the sick and educate the nation's children. One letter sent from the HMRC office in Croydon described in graphic terms how 'embarrassing' and costly it would be for the taxpayer if a debt of more than £2,000 was not settled. 'We must collect this tax from you to pay for the hospitals and schools we all rely on. We will do that by taking your possessions and auctioning them publicly. 'We don't like doing this because people have told us it is embarrassing for them and it will cost you so much more to pay this way. 'For instance, if your car is worth several thousand pounds, it might sell for only a few hundred pounds at auction, a flat-screen TV costing £2,000 would typically sell for about £200-£300, and an £800 laptop would sell for about £100.' Praised: The Mail on Sunday story from earlier this year that exposed how HMRC was sending menacing letters to late payers. In their report, MPs painted a dismal picture of HMRC as an organisation in deep crisis, with 'endemic delays'. Staff were so over-stretched that more than half of calls from the public went unanswered and letters were ignored for months. The report comes after HMRC admitted last year that six million people had paid the wrong amount of tax in previous years. Last night HMRC remained defiant about the letters, saying most of the them were sent to people who either repeatedly failed to respond or refused to pay up. The Treasury declined to make a statement last night. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"The UK Treasury Committee has ordered HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to stop sending threatening letters to people who owe them money, stating that cars and televisions would be seized and sold off.

Question: Process: - Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher - Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack - Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack - Place all the utensils in the utensil basket - Put detergent into the detergent holder - Close the door and push the start button - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are dishes left from a dinner happens, how will it affect HURTING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Rinse the dishes before placing them in a dishwasher Justification: Rinsing the dishes removes any large food particles and debris, which prevents clogging the dishwasher's filter and ensures better overall cleaning. Step 2: Load glasses and plastic wear on the top rack Justification: Glasses and plastic wear are more delicate and generally lighter, so placing them on the top rack reduces the risk of damage and allows better water circulation around them. Step 3: Put plates, bowls, pots, and pans on the bottom rack Justification: These items are generally heavier and more sturdy, so placing them on the bottom rack allows them to be exposed to the more powerful water jets and get a better overall cleaning. Step 4: Place all the utensils in the utensil basket Justification: The utensil basket helps keep utensils separated and organized, ensuring they are cleaned thoroughly without getting tangled or scratched. Step 5: Put detergent into the detergent holder Justification: The detergent holder releases detergent during the washing process, ensuring the dishes are cleaned with the right amount of detergent. Step 6: Close the door and push the start button Justification: This initiates the dishwasher cycle and begins the process of cleaning the dishes. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose there are dishes left from a dinner that happens, how will it affect hurting the dishwasher to clean better. Considering the perturbation hypothesis, if there are more dishes left from a dinner, it may lead to a higher load of dishes than usual in the dishwasher. This could potentially affect the dishwasher's ability to clean effectively, as overcrowding may restrict water flow and the proper circulation of detergent. To address this issue, it's crucial to not overload the dishwasher and, if necessary, run multiple cycles to accommodate the extra load of dishes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis directly affects the process by potentially causing overcrowding of dishes in the dishwasher, which may lead to a less effective cleaning. To ensure optimal cleaning, it's essential to not overload the dishwasher and run multiple cycles if needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the real names of the men that helped add a \\"more analogue sound\\" to a song previously recorded by M.I.A?, using the article: In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505. The track was co-written by Frischmann, whose input M.I.A. described as \\"refreshing\\". She initially hoped to feature guest vocalists on..., what would be the answer ?

I do try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. It doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. Kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. None of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. I will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like Screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. But the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes \\"I quit!\\" had me in stitches. My favourite is Screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and I suppose intelligent. If anything though, I wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to Kenneth Mars for he was absolutely superb as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. Sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Sun/Moon offer an entirely new region, Alola, with different mechanics and new Pokémon. If you like trying new things and exploring new regions, then waiting for Sun/Moon would be the better option.

Carolina starting quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown. With 3 minutes left in the first quarter, running back Carnell Williams blasted down the field for an 18-yard run, but his right leg buckled, seriously injuring his knee. As he was being carted off the field, nearly the entire Buccaneers team, along with several Panthers players, huddled around Williams in support. After the injury timeout, Earnest Graham salvaged the drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay extended their halftime lead to 17-0 after a Matt Bryant field goal, meanwhile, Carolina's offense was sputtering, blasted by the Buccaneers defense, who sacked Carr three times, and intercepeted him once. Carr completed only 19 of 41 pass attempts, and Carolina was facing their first shutout in five seasons. With 23 seconds left in regulation, Carolina finally got on the board with a touchdown pass to DeAngelo Williams. An onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Buccaneers won their third straight game. Through four games, the Buccaneers had not given up any points in the first quarter, and quarterback Jeff Garcia had not thrown an interception. After the game, the Buccaneers announced that running back Carnell Williams (torn patellar ligament) and left tackle Luke Petitgout (torn ACL) would both face season-ending surgery.

Title: This rendition of Verdi's requiem is unacceptable Review: I agree with many people who have a problem with Andrea Bocelli. Surely, they could have chosen a much better tenor, like Jose Carerras or Roberto Alagna. Renee Fleming does have a charming voice, and Borodina has great depth in her emotion, but these two don't seem to fit as a balanced cast in this requiem by Verdi. And personally, I prefer Gergiev conducting the Russian operas, not an Italian piece.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this version of Verdi's requiem to anyone. Bocelli is just not operatic with his voice. He should stick with his Pop music and stay away from Puccini, Donizetti, etc.I would recommend conductor Emil Tabakov's version, with singers Romanko, Ombuena, and de Grandis.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Teenagers and their families will have found out the good news and the disappointments. That is really the story of the day - the hundreds of thousands of individual triumphs and disasters that make up this collective academic rite of passage. An analysis of Twitter today showed that \\"Good luck\\" was one of the most-used phrases. And parents would have stepped away for a few moments to look at their phones to check text messages from their children that would put years of ambition into a few words. It might be expressed through cliches of leaping teenagers and tearful conversations into mobile phones - but each set of results is a turning point in young lives. School is officially finished and now there are big decisions. For an increasing number, the destination is going to be university. The figures for university places published on results day are still incomplete - but they show a 3% increase on the same time this year, with 424,000 already allocated. This includes a rising number of EU students, who would have applied before the referendum, and it remains to be seen whether the numbers hold up for next year. But despite tuition fees being pushed up even higher, to Â£9,250 from next year, the numbers going to university increase relentlessly. And the clearing process, which has got under way today, will find places for tens of thousands more students, with universities competing to fill any empty spaces. It will re-ignite the question whether university is worth the expense. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that doubling the number of students had not meant a reduction in higher graduate earnings. Instead the labour market has changed, with more graduate jobs and diminishing opportunities for less well-qualified workers. In the United States, having a degree has become a clear dividing line, with graduates much more likely to be in secure, better-paid jobs, while non-graduates are increasingly facing insecure and low-paid jobs. But the IFS report also has a strong note of caution that at some point a rising number of students will tip over into a process of diminishing returns. The increase in university numbers might seem to run counter to the other headline - that the proportion of top A-level grades has fallen for the fifth successive year. But apart from the most marginal of changes, the exam results this year are remarkably similar to those from last year. The fall in A* and A grades is only by 0.1% and the overall pass rate is identical. Such stability is not accidental. It's the effect of a system designed to make each year comparable with the last. We report the rise and fall of results as though measuring a natural phenomenon, like taking the changing temperature outside the window. But an exam-grading system sets its own boundaries and outcomes - and this year's results are almost identical with those from last year. There is no grade inflation and no sudden falls. Head teachers have long complained that below this smooth surface there are all kinds of individual problems - but the big picture remains one of year-to-year consistency. The results day also casts a light on what subjects are being studied. Maths, English and biology are the most popular. But there was a further decline in modern languages, with the number taking French A-level, the most popular language, falling below 10,000 for the first time. Head teachers have suggested that schools under financial pressure might not be able to afford to run subjects with small numbers of students. The Institute of Physics was concerned that the numbers studying physics had fallen this year. But for now, with all the results announced and envelopes opened, the next phase of the story will be personal rather than political, with celebrations and commiserations, as the long summer weeks after A-levels come to a symbolic end.","completion":"Teenagers in the UK are receiving their A-level results today, which mark a turning point in their lives as they decide what comes next, with many heading to university.

Abstrakti tietotyyppi Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Abstract Data Type The term \\"Abstrakti tietotyyppi\\" is Finnish and can be translated to \\"Abstract Data Type\\" in English. An abstract data type (ADT) is a high-level description of a collection of data and the operations that can be performed on that data. It is a conceptual representation of how data can be organized and manipulated. The representation of an abstract data type hides the implementation details from a user. This means the user only needs to understand what the data type does, but not how it does it. ADTs promote the principle of data abstraction, which allows simpler and more modular programming. ADTs are often defined by their operations and behaviors, rather than their specific implementation. For example, a stack is an abstract data type with the operations push and pop. There could be many different implementations of a stack (e.g., using an array or a linked list), but the user of the stack does not need to be aware of these details, as long as they understand the basic functionality provided by the stack. Some common ADTs include: 1. Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that supports inserting an element at the top (push operation) and removing the top element (pop operation). 2. Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports inserting an element at the rear (enqueue operation) and removing the front element (dequeue operation). 3. List: An ordered collection of elements that supports adding, removing, and searching for elements based on their position in the list. 4. Tree: A hierarchically organized data structure that consists of nodes, with one designated as the root node and each node having a possible set of child nodes. 5. Graph: A collection of nodes and edges that connect nodes, representing a nonlinear data structure that can be used to model complex relationships between objects or data points. Each of these abstract data types can have multiple implementations, which can be optimized for specific environments or use cases. These concrete implementations can be selected based on their performance, memory usage, and other factors that are important for the specific application using the ADT. The use of abstract data types helps to ensure that the code is more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand and modify as requirements change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She could understand them easily; at the same time she taught the children to speak English and play the piano. After hearing that her father was seriously ill; Edith returned home to look after him. She then decided to become a nurse. Afterwards for five years she worked in an English hospital where she proved to be highly professional at her job. A Belgian doctor was so impressed that he invited her to his country to organize a training school for nurses. The First World War broke out in 1914 and Edith Cavell's school of nursing became a hospital. She stayed there to look after the sick and wounded soldiers . Edith treated them with kindness. Between November 1914 and August 1915 she secretly helped about 200 wounded soldiers and prisoners escape from the Germans. Later the German army found out what Edith had done and they arrested her. Finally; the Germans killed her; but they could not _ . A tall statue has been built in Trafalgar Square; London; in honor of the brave English nurse. Question: Why did Edith return home from Belgium? Options: A: Because she found work in an English hospital. B: Because she organized a training school for nurses. C: Because the First World War broke out. D: Because her father was seriously ill.

Write the answer: What architectural term was applied by the Romans to any public building built in a rectangle twice as long as it was broad with an internal 2 storied colonnade?","completion":"The architectural term that the Romans applied to any public building built in a rectangle twice as long as it was broad with an internal two-storied colonnade is known as the \\"Basilica.\\" Originally, the term basilica referred to a type of ancient Roman building that served various purposes, including judicial proceedings, commerce, and other public gatherings. These were important civic structures located primarily in the Roman Forum, the central gathering place in ancient Roman cities. The structure of a Basilica typically features a central nave, which is the open central space that runs longitudinally from the entrance to the end of the building, and two aisles on either side. The interior of the building showcases a two-storied colonnade or arcade, which are rows of columns supporting arches. This design often uses Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian columns, acknowledging the influence of ancient Greek architecture on Roman designs. One of the distinguishing aspects of a Roman basilica is the presence of an apse, a semicircular or polygonal space at one or both ends of the building. The apse was typically used for the magistrate's seated position, or for housing a statue or other important artifacts. The oblong shape of a basilica made it an ideal space for a variety of activities. The design allowed for an open floor plan that could be easily adapted to accommodate large crowds, as well as to provide privacy with the help of internal partitions when needed. These buildings often had high, vaulted roofs supported by wooden beams, allowing for plenty of natural light to enter through clerestory windows, creating a spacious and grand atmosphere within the basilica. There are several well-known examples of Roman basilicas, such as the Basilica Julia and Basilica Aemilia in the Roman Forum, and the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, also known as the Basilica Nova. As the Roman Empire expanded, the concept of a basilica spread throughout Europe and the Mediterranean region. The architectural form of the basilica greatly influenced the development of early Christian architecture, as it was adopted for constructing churches. Many early Christian basilicas, such as Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Basilica of San Clemente, were built on the foundations and design principles of ancient Roman basilicas. Over time, the term \\"basilica\\" has become more closely associated with Christian churches, particularly those that have significant historical, architectural, or ecclesiastical importance. In fact, today many renowned churches around the world, such as St. Peter's Basilica and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, still carry the historic name which originated from ancient Roman architectural principles."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. Question: What is probably true about most people?

Answer the following question: I've had two. Both happened in Newport RI when I was in the US Navy. First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit. That was nearly 50 years ago and it still pisses me off. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why is the sailor still pissed off today? OPTIONS: [i] because the Landlord wouldn't refund the deposit; [ii] because the landlady listened to phone calls; [iii] because the landlady showed up at parties in sexy clothing; [iv] not enough information; Answer:","completion":"[i] because the Landlord wouldn't refund the deposit;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here are two sentences: He had said before the meeting that he planned to urge Chinese officials to move quickly to adopt a more flexible currency system . He has said he plans to urge Chinese officials during the G20 meeting to move more quickly to adopt a more flexible currency system . Are the two sentences saying the same thing?","completion":"Yes, the two sentences convey the same general message, but they phrase it in slightly different ways. Both sentences indicate that the speaker plans to encourage Chinese officials to adopt a more flexible currency system at a faster pace. However, the differences in the sentences lie in the specific context in which this encouragement is expressed. In the first sentence: \\"He had said before the meeting that he planned to urge Chinese officials to move quickly to adopt a more flexible currency system,\\" the use of \\"had said before the meeting\\" suggests that this statement was made in the past, prior to the actual meeting. Additionally, the syntax implies that the speaker already attended the meeting and is recounting something that was stated before it took place. On the other hand, the second sentence: \\"He has said he plans to urge Chinese officials during the G20 meeting to move more quickly to adopt a more flexible currency system,\\" employs the present perfect tense \\"has said,\\" which denotes a connection between the past and the present. This suggests that the statement was made at some point in the past, and its implications are still relevant. Furthermore, it specifically mentions \\"the G20 meeting,\\" whereas the first sentence does not provide any particular context about the meeting. In summary, both sentences communicate the same core message that the speaker intends to press Chinese officials to adopt a more flexible currency system rapidly. The variations in the sentence structures and tenses, along with the added detail of the G20 meeting in the second sentence, contribute to the unique nuances present in each statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Between then and its own merger with Boeing in 1997, it produced a number of well-known commercial and military aircraft such as the DC-10 airliner and F-15 Eagle air-superiority fighter. - The Kamov Ka - 118 is a projected light multirole helicopter with the NOTAR ( NO TAil Rotor ) configuration based on the McDonnell Douglas design . - The Douglas Aircraft Company was an American aerospace manufacturer based in Southern California. It was founded in 1921 by Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. and later merged with McDonnell Aircraft in 1967 to form McDonnell Douglas. Douglas Aircraft Company largely operated as a division of McDonnell Douglas (MD) after the merger. MD later merged with Boeing in 1997. - The Coand effect (or ) is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface. A better definition has been provided by Henri Coand in different patents and have been reported by Merriam Webster dictionary: \\"the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops.\\" The pressure effect, which is usually not indicated, is fundamental for the comprehension of the Coand effect. - In physics and fluid mechanics, a boundary layer is an important concept and refers to the layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface where the effects of viscosity are significant. - The tail rotor is a smaller rotor mounted so that it rotates vertically or near-vertically at the end of the tail of a traditional single-rotor helicopter. The tail rotor's position and distance from the center of gravity allow it to develop thrust in the same direction as the main rotor's rotation, to counter the torque effect created by the main rotor. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis. - The McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was an American aerospace manufacturer based in St. Louis, Missouri. The company was founded on July 6, 1939 by James Smith McDonnell, and was best known for its military fighters, including the F-4 Phantom II, and manned spacecraft including the Mercury capsule and Gemini capsule. McDonnell Aircraft later merged with the Douglas Aircraft Company to form McDonnell Douglas in 1967. - A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward, and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft cannot perform. - Hughes Helicopters was a major manufacturer of military and civil helicopters from the 1950s to the 1980s. - NOTAR (\\"no\\" \\"ta\\"il \\"r\\"otor) is the name of a helicopter system which avoids the use of a tail rotor. It was developed by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems (through their acquisition of Hughes Helicopters). The system uses a fan inside the tailboom to build a high volume of low-pressure air, which exits through two slots and creates a boundary layer flow of air along the tailboom utilizing the Coand effect. The boundary layer changes the direction of airflow around the tailboom, creating thrust opposite the motion imparted to the fuselage by the torque effect of the main rotor. Directional yaw control is gained through a vented, rotating drum at the end of the tailboom, called the direct jet thruster. Advocates of NOTAR believe the system offers quieter and safer operation. - The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, and satellites worldwide. The company also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aircraft manufacturers; it is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2015 revenue, and is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value. Boeing stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. - The fuselage (from the French \\"fuselé\\" \\"spindle-shaped\\") is an aircraft's main body section that holds crew and passengers or cargo. In single-engine aircraft it will usually contain an engine, although in some amphibious aircraft the single engine is mounted on a pylon attached to the fuselage which in turn is used as a floating hull.

Obama's gay marriage endorsement could cost him with crucial swing voters Wednesday afternoon, Barack Obama became the first president of the United States to openly support same sex marriage – declaring unequivocal support for gay marriage in an interview with ABC News. His surprise endorsement reflects the position being echoed by the Obama administration that the forces of history appear to be changing and the public opinion tide has turned in favor of same-sex marriage – as evidenced by a Gallup survey released last week that showed 50 percent of Americans supporting legalized gay marriage, with just 48 percent opposing it. To be sure, this announcement was a political move for the Obama 2012 reelection campaign which is now aggressively seeking to use his endorsement to mobilize a major grassroots get-out-the-vote initiative and energize huge swaths of the party’s liberal and progressive base, as well as young people and independent voters, many of whom back gay marriage. And with the Obama reelection campaign increasingly relying on donations form the gay community in its fundraising efforts, publicly declaring his support for gay marriage hours before he headed to Hollywood Thursday night for a fundraiser at the home of A-list actor George Clooney was a strategic and shrewdly timed move by Mr. Obama. But it is a move that is also politically problematic – and one that could very well cost him some swing states. Put simply, the issue of gay marriage remains highly contentious in a number of swing states: a majority of voters in North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Florida continue to be against same sex marriage. The state-by-state data from polling conducted by Public Policy Polling show that a majority of voters in key swing-states like Virginia (53%-34%), Florida (53%-37%), North Carolina (61%-31%), Wisconsin (50%-30%) and Ohio (52%-32%) oppose the legalization of gay marriage. And according to a recent Pew poll, one in three Southern swing voters are strongly opposed to gay marriage. All of this in light of the fact that ballot measures to legalize gay marriage have been rejected by voters nearly every time over the course of fifteen years by voters in more than 30 states — often by large margins. Among the 30 states that have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriages are key battleground swing-states like Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and North Carolina. These states have a combined 114 electoral votes up for grabs. In light of these numbers, while yesterday's move may be a political winner for President Obama among his progressive base, it may very well cost him the support of swing voters whose vote will be central to his success in winning reelection.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who has an old friend that is a scrawny and barely functinoal human being? from the following article ? About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against.

Now we have -2*m + 7 = -9 3. To isolate m, we first need to cancel out the constant term (+7) on the left side of the equation by subtracting 7 from both sides: -2*m = -9 - 7 4. This results in -2*m = -16 5. Next, we need to cancel out the coefficient of m (-2). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -2: m = (-16) / (-2) 6.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many months after the Battle of Sasowy Róg was an agreement between Żółkiewski and Tomșa signed?","completion":"Title: The Road to Resolution: The Battle of Sasowy Róg and the Żółkiewski-Tomșa Agreement Introduction: The Battle of Sasowy Róg marks a critical turning point in the Moldavian Magnate Wars (1593-1617). Amidst the turmoil of political and military power struggles in Eastern Europe, the battle emerged as a significant event that eventually led to the signing of the landmark agreement between Polish-Lithuanian commander Żółkiewski and Moldavian Prince Tomșa. This article will explore the time elapsed from the end of the battle until the signing of the agreement, shedding light on the events that occurred during these crucial months. The Battle of Sasowy Róg: A Turning Point in the Moldavian Magnate Wars The Battle of Sasowy Róg took place on July 5, 1612, and saw the forces of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth led by Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski face off against the Ottoman forces and their Moldavian allies, commanded by Prince Ştefan Tomșa. The Commonwealth’s forces emerged victorious, marking a strategic triumph in the region. This victory not only weakened the strength and morale of the Moldavian and Ottoman opposition but also set the stage for further negotiation between the opposing leaders. The Żółkiewski-Tomșa Agreement: A Peaceful Pact Following the events of the Battle of Sasowy Róg, the victorious Żółkiewski sought a peaceful resolution and opened negotiations with the defeated Prince Tomșa. The talks aimed to stabilize the political situation in the region and ensure the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's influence over Moldavia. Żółkiewski offered Prince Tomșa terms for a truce, which involved his recognition as the legitimate ruler of Moldavia in exchange for his loyalty to the Commonwealth. Time Elapsed between the Battle and the Agreement The negotiations between Żółkiewski and Tomșa took place gradually after the battle in July 1612. With both parties ultimately seeking peace, the parties assented to the terms of the alliance. The Żółkiewski-Tomșa Agreement was hence signed on November 27, 1612, approximately five months after the Battle of Sasowy Róg. Conclusion: The Legacy of the Agreement The signing of the Żółkiewski-Tomșa Agreement, taking place five months after the Battle of Sasowy Róg, marked a significant milestone in the Moldavian Magnate Wars. It cemented the loyalty of Prince Tomșa to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, ensuring the region's stability for the foreseeable future. Moreover, it demonstrated the determination of leaders like Żółkiewski to seek peaceful resolutions in a tumultuous political landscape. The agreement stands as a testament to the importance of diplomacy and negotiation in times of conflict, even amidst the challenges of war and ever-changing political alliances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including ammonia that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony and form a layer of slime in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. \\"This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,\\" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. \\"The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,\\" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. \\"It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,\\" Dr. Nijland said. \\"Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier.\\" The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true regarding bacteria's ability to detect smells, as discovered by the scientists from Newcastle University? A. Bacteria can detect smells and form a colony to repel competitors. B. Bacteria can only detect smells produced by humans, not by other bacteria. C.

Bacteria can detect smells and form a colony to repel competitors."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Steps of Virus Infections A virus must use cell processes to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called cytopathic (causing cell damage) effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or “cell suicide”), releasing all progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release (Figure 21.8). Attachment A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. The specificity of this interaction determines the host—and the cells within the host—that can be infected by a particular virus. This can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each key will fit only one specific lock. Q: Symptoms of viral diseases result from what kind of response to a virus?

So dead, partying for Freddies birthday What is the sentiment of this tweet?","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet appears to be primarily positive with a hint of playfulness. Here's a detailed analysis of the various elements contributing to the sentiment: 1. \\"So dead\\" - This phrase does not necessarily carry a negative sentiment in this context. It's likely that the person using this term means they are exhausted or overwhelmed, which may perhaps suggest an implication that they had a great time at the party. Additionally, colloquial language is often used informally and can have various meanings depending on the context. In this case, it seems that the sentiment is not negative. 2. \\"Partying for Freddie's birthday\\" - This phrase indicates the reason behind the exhaustion or potential overwhelming feeling experienced by the person who posted the tweet. The act of celebrating someone's birthday generally conveys a positive sentiment, as it is a social event meant to appreciate and enjoy the company of the person whose birthday is being celebrated. Since the tweet mentions partying, it suggests that the event was lively, filled with excitement, and likely involved engaging with friends and family while having a good time. 3. Playfulness - The mix of these two phrases highlights a playful tone. The juxtaposition of the term \\"so dead\\" and the mention of a birthday party might be seen as humorous, which adds to the overall positive sentiment. The tweet can be interpreted as cheeky, implying that the person had such a great time during the event that they felt exhausted or 'dead' afterward. In summary, the sentiment of the tweet, \\"So dead, partying for Freddies birthday,\\" is principally positive with a touch of playfulness. It implies that the person had a fun and exciting time at the party, celebrating Freddie's birthday with friends and family.

The first step is to prepare the vegetables by cutting them into uniform bite-sized pieces. Remove any stems and discolored areas during this process.","completion":"Wash the vegetables thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris that may be present. Once they are clean, pat them dry using a clean kitchen towel or paper towel to remove excess moisture, as this can cause the oil to splatter when sautéing. Select a wide and shallow pan, preferably one with a heavy bottom that distributes heat evenly, such as a non-stick skillet or stainless steel sauté pan. Heat the pan over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes before adding the oil. Choose an oil with a high smoke point, like olive oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil, to avoid the oil breaking down during the cooking process. Pour in a few tablespoons of oil to coat the bottom of the pan evenly, ensuring that there is a thin and continuous layer. Allow the oil to heat up for a few seconds until it begins to shimmer. Carefully place the cut vegetables in the pan, spacing them out to avoid overcrowding. Overcrowding can lead to steaming rather than sautéing, which may result in a less desirable texture. If needed, sauté the vegetables in batches to ensure they cook properly. As the vegetables cook, use a spatula or wooden spoon to move and flip the vegetables frequently, allowing for even cooking and browning. Cook the vegetables until they are tender and display a slightly golden color, which might take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the type and size of the vegetables being used. Be mindful of the fact that certain vegetables, such as carrots, may take longer to cook than softer ones, like zucchini or bell peppers. For added flavor, consider incorporating aromatics and seasonings into your sautéed vegetables. Some common aromatics include garlic, onions, or shallots, which can be finely chopped and added to the pan a few minutes before the vegetables are done cooking. Season the vegetables to taste with salt, pepper, and fresh or dried herbs like basil, thyme, or oregano. You can also add a splash of vinegar, soy sauce, or lemon juice towards the end of sautéing for a tangy flavor. As you become more experienced with sautéing vegetables, feel free to experiment with different combinations of vegetables, oils, aromatics, and seasonings to find flavors and textures that suit your personal preference. When your vegetables have reached their desired texture and consistency, remove them from the heat and transfer them to a serving dish using a slotted spoon or tongs, allowing excess oil to drain back into the pan. Ideally, serve the sautéed vegetables immediately while they are still hot and retain their vibrant colors. They can be enjoyed as a side dish, mixed into salads or grain bowls, or topped onto pasta, rice, or other main courses to create a satisfying and nourishing meal. By mastering the art of sautéing vegetables, you can ensure that you always have a versatile and deliciously prepared dish within reach, transforming even the simplest of ingredients into a culinary delight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPT: +No; +Yes; Answer:","completion":"No, \\"Taft served in this capacity until shortly before his death in 1930.\\" would not be a reasonable answer as it doesn't address the political conflicts during his presidency. Therefore, a more detailed and long answer would be as follows: When discussing the presidency of William Howard Taft, several political conflicts marked his tenure in office. Taft served as the 27th president of the United States from 1909 to 1913. Some of the key political conflicts during his presidency include: 1. Struggles with Progressive Republicans: Taft's administration faced significant opposition from progressive Republicans, led by his predecessor and mentor, Theodore Roosevelt. The progressives believed that Taft was hesitant in promoting social and political reforms and that his policies were overly conservative. These tensions led to the division of the Republican Party and weakened Taft's support base. 2. Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act (1909): One of the major policy disputes during Taft's tenure was the enactment of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, which altered tariff rates in the United States. Many progressive elements within the Republican Party, as well as Democrats, opposed the legislation, arguing that it protected big businesses and maintained high consumer prices. This issue drove a wedge between Taft and the progressives, leading them to question his commitment to reform. 3. Ballinger-Pinchot controversy (1910): A significant disagreement emerged between Taft and progressive Republicans over conservation policies. Taft's Secretary of the Interior, Richard Ballinger, clashed with the head of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot over land and resource management. Pinchot accused Ballinger of favoring private interests over public concerns, leading to his dismissal. This move ignited an outcry from the progressive camp, further eroding Taft's support. 4. The decline of progressive legislation: Taft's presidency saw a significant reduction in the number of progressive laws enacted as compared to Theodore Roosevelt's administration. This led to a perception among some that his administration was undermining reform efforts. For instance, Taft's support of dollar diplomacy and opposition to organized labor left many within the progressive movement deeply unsatisfied. 5. Rift with Theodore Roosevelt: Perhaps the most notable political conflict during Taft's presidency was the widening rift between him and former President Roosevelt. Disappointed with Taft's policies, Roosevelt sought to challenge him for the Republican nomination in the 1912 presidential election. Roosevelt's entry into the race divided the Republican vote, ultimately leading to the election of Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson. These political conflicts played a significant role in defining Taft's presidency. His inability to manage the diverse factions within his party and his perceived retreat from progressive reforms greatly impacted his political legacy and contributed to his defeat in the 1912 election."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

His work, though mundane and labor-intensive, was what he had to call a living. Yet, at the end of one particularly grueling day, he found himself cheated out of a day's pay. This act of injustice sparked a flame of rebellion in his heart. His disillusionment was an echo of the wild west's nature, unpredictable, untamed and often, cruel. One day, as William, beaten, but not broken, wandered aimlessly, contemplating his misfortune, an old acquaintance of his, Pat Garrett, happened upon him. Garrett, a former buffalo hunter, turned sheriff, had recently been hired by a British land baron, who was looking for robust men to take care of his vast land holdings in the New World. Seeing William's dejected spirits and underpaid wages, Garrett empathized with his plight and offered him a job under the British land baron. William, driven by his need for a fair wage and a fresh start, graciously accepted. It was an opportunity to set life straight in the rugged expanse of the west. Life under the British land baron, however, was not filled with just usual monotonous chores for William. Amid the chaos and dust, he saw her - a local beauty working at the land's tavern. A flame ignited in his heart the moment he laid eyes on her. Her emerald green eyes were a mirror to her soul, and her laughter made him feel alive in the harsh realities of the wild west. However, her beauty was not the only thing that captivated him; her spirit shimmered through her actions and thoughts, making her irresistible to him. The wild, reckless William Bonney found himself falling deeply and madly in love with this enchanting woman. Despite the positive transition in Billy’s life, his past, however, was never quite ready to let go of him. Olinger, a local town troublemaker who held a grudge against William since a previous horse deal, carried an agenda of his own. Feeding off shady rumors about Billy's past, Olinger made his way to Watkins, the local authority and comprised a plan. He sought to dig up a wanted poster reflective of Billy’s infamous history. His malicious plan was maneuvered by his aim to tarnish Billy’s newfound resilience and to seek revenge on him. As the dust of Olinger's deceit swirled around, news reached the governor of New Mexico. Concerned about maintaining law and order in his territory, he recalled the days when Pat Garrett had served as a reliable sheriff. He believed Garrett had the tenacity and tact to bring Billy, a possible outlaw, to justice. Thus, the governor invited Garrett to his mansion and asked him to take up a job once again as the sheriff to handle the possible threat that Billy might pose. He trusted Garrett to tread on the path of righteousness, even if it meant confronting an old friend. From the exhilarating trails of the wild west to the saloons ablaze with intoxicating tales, the story of William Bonney, the star-crossed lover, trying to leave his notorious past behind and Pat Garrett, an old friend who was expected to bring him to justice, unfolded. It was a testament to the ever-morphing chapters of the wild west, where justice, friendship, and survival danced a precarious waltz against the backdrop of the vast open plains."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"One popular theory suggests that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it \\"Bhagyanagar\\" or \\"Bhāgnagar\\" after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What person is Hyderabad said to have been renamed for?\\"","completion":"Yes, that statement offers a good answer to the question, \\"What person is Hyderabad said to have been renamed for?\\" It provides clear information regarding the popular theory that attributes the city's renaming to Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl who had a romantic relationship with the city's founder, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. However, let's elaborate further to provide a more detailed long answer. There are various theories surrounding the origin and naming of the city of Hyderabad, located in the state of Telangana in southern India. One widely accepted theory is that it has been named after a local dancer, Bhagmati. According to this theory, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, founded the city in 1591. He fell in love with Bhagmati, a talented and beautiful dancing girl from the nearby village of Chichlam. As their love story grew, he named the city \\"Bhagyanagar\\" or \\"Bhāgnagar\\" in her honor. Bhagmati later embraced Islam and took the name \\"Hyder Mahal,\\" which is believed to have led to the city's new name, \\"Hyderabad.\\" The term \\"Hyderabad\\" itself reflects the city's Muslim roots, combining the Persian word \\"Hyder,\\" which means lion, with the Indo-Aryan word \\"ābād,\\" meaning settlement or city. Hence, Hyderabad can be translated as \\"the city or settlement of the lion.\\" In addition to the popular romantic narrative, there are alternative theories as well, which suggest that the city's name, Hyderabad, represents the intersection of cultures and the fusion of Hindu and Muslim influences in the Qutb Shahi dynasty. For instance, the term \\"Hyder\\" can also refer to Ali Ibn Abi Talib, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and his cousin, who was also known as \\"Asadullah,\\" which translates to \\"Lion of God\\" in Arabic. This interpretation likewise associates Hyderabad with a political and spiritual figure, further illustrating the historical significance and diversity of the city. In conclusion, while there are several theories about Hyderabad's naming, the most popular suggests that it was renamed after Bhagmati, a local nautch girl who had a romantic relationship with the city's founder, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah. The naming of Hyderabad, as well as the alternative theories around its etymology, highlights the rich history, cultural diversity, and the fusion of Hindu and Muslim influences that shape the city to this day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the Origin of Species Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \\"just as noble a conception of Deity\\". In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as \\"a celebrated cleric\\", and added the phrase \\"by the Creator\\" to the closing sentence, which from then on read \\"life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one\\".

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. Question: 'Who's country was Stoltenberg told by someone would be very rich?

It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems. - PTS-DOS is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft. - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems. - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS.

The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation. - A-10 Tank Killer is a flight simulation computer game for Amiga and DOS platforms developed and published by Dynamix.

In a press release Monday afternoon, officials said next-of-kin have been notified regarding the deaths of the two inmates who died during the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution disturbance. The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating the deaths. Inmate Peacock, Donald #79816, (DOB 3/15/1969), was serving 40 to 50 years from Dodge County for 1st degree sexual assault on a child and visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. He began his sentence on March 12, 2014. Inmate Collins, Shon #71556, (DOB 3/5/1969), was serving 66 to 80 years from Box Butte County for 1st degree sexual assault of a child and visual depiction of sexually explicit content. His sentence began on May 17, 2010. Cause of death has not been determined, however, the injuries appear to have been caused by other inmates. Public notification was delayed as staff worked to locate and notify the inmates’ emergency contacts. Both notifications have been made. State Corrections Director Scott Frakes didn't provide many details about the deaths that were discovered Monday as officials regained control of the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution. Frakes said the deaths are still being investigated.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: When was the unsuccessful uprising in India that the events were covered by Sir William Howard Russell take place? Answer:","completion":"The unsuccessful uprising in India, which was extensively covered by Sir William Howard Russell, took place in 1857. This uprising is widely known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the First War of Indian Independence, or the Sepoy Mutiny. It was a major, yet ultimately unsuccessful, revolt against British rule in India, which had significant ramifications for the country's future. The events leading up to the uprising were a combination of political, social, economic, and religious grievances against the British East India Company's rule. The primary catalyst for the rebellion was the introduction of new rifle cartridges rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat, which was offensive to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers since it went against their religious beliefs. This increased the growing discontent among the Indian soldiers, or sepoys, and fueled their desire for rebellion. Sir William Howard Russell, an Irish reporter, and war correspondent reported the events of the Indian Rebellion for The Times newspaper in London. Russell had previously covered the Crimean War and was a respected voice in journalism. His accounts of the uprising provided the British public with firsthand information about the events that were unfolding in India, making him one of the primary sources of news and insight into the rebellion. His detailed reports highlighted the brutality and atrocities committed by both sides during the conflict. Russell documented British reprisals as harsh and severe, which fueled concerns back in Britain about the methods used to suppress the rebellion. Nonetheless, his reporting played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and even influencing British policy in India. The uprising ultimately failed due to several factors, including the lack of unified leadership, minimal coordination among the rebelling sepoys and civilian population, superior British military might, and support from local Indian rulers loyal to the British Crown. The aftermath of the revolt led to the dissolution of the British East India Company and the subsequent establishment of direct British rule (known as the British Raj) as India became formally integrated into the British Empire. In conclusion, the unsuccessful uprising that Sir William Howard Russell reported on took place in 1857 and was a pivotal moment in Indian history that directly influenced its future under British rule. Russell's coverage provided an invaluable account of the events unfolding in India and played a key role in shaping public opinion in Britain regarding its colonial affairs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: New Rules Are Big Brake for Two Rail Suppliers The two companies that stand to gain most from new railroad-safety regulations are a German-owned manufacturer of train brakes in upstate New York and a former division of engineering giant Westinghouse Electric Co. based in tiny Wilmerding, Pa. New York Air Brake Corp., a unit of German industrial company Knorr-Bremse AG, and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp. WAB 6.14 % , or Wabtec, are the only two companies in the U.S. that manufacture electronically controlled pneumatic, or ECP, brake systems for trains, according to the Railway Supply Institute, a trade group. Department of Transportation regulations unveiled Friday would, among other measures, require trains with more than 70 tank cars carrying oil, ethanol and other flammable liquids to be upgraded with ECP brakes or hold their speed to 30 mph. The requirement would be a major headache for owners of tank cars and locomotives. Outfitting each tank car costs between 6,000 and 8,000, according to rail consultants and brake manufacturers, and the cost for locomotives would be even more. Equipping more than 125,000 tank cars would mean more than 1 billion in capital investment, the Railroad Supply Institute estimates. “We’re not breaking out the champagne yet,” Mike Hawthorne, president of New York Air Brake, said in an interview. “This is an opportunity for us to see one of our big technology investments get more play in the market, but we’d be absolutely doing it in support of our customers. We don’t want to sell product just to satisfy a regulation. We want to sell a product that would solve this safety problem.” In a written statement, Wabtec said it was reviewing the new rules “and will support their implementation as needed,” but declined to comment further. In a recent earnings conference call, Wabtec’s executive chairman, Al Neupaver, said the company has been working with ECP braking for many years, and “we have the capabilities and capacity to support the industry with this proven technology.” Wabtec’s share price rose 6.1% to an all-time high of 99.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The company, based outside of Pittsburgh, has a market value of 9.1 billion. Annual rail shipments of oil have risen from 20 million barrels in 2010 to a projected 374 million this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as North American oil production has boomed and plans to expand pipelines to move crude oil have largely stalled. But the rise of oil-by-rail has led to more high-profile accidents, including two in March in Illinois and Ontario that produced huge fireballs and a 2013 derailment in Quebec that killed 47 people. Federal regulators want upgraded brakes on tank cars to prevent accidents. Wabtec says stopping distances can be reduced between 40% and 60% by ECP brakes, and the technology allows train operators to gradually apply and release the brakes, providing greater flexibility. Standard pneumatic brakes are either fully applied or fully released. The American Petroleum Institute and the Association of American Railroads have criticized the ECP requirement, saying the effectiveness of ECP technology requires more analysis. They also contend that the cost of the new brakes would be onerous for both the railroads, which would lose capacity and pay for locomotive upgrades, and tank-car owners. It is also unclear whether there is enough capacity to upgrade the thousands of tank cars that would need to meet the new regulations. New York Air Brake, which is based in Watertown, N.Y., has sold about 15,000 ECP brake systems globally, but most are used on trains shipping coal along heavy freight lines from mines to ports in South Africa and Australia. Summary:","completion":"New US Department of Transportation regulations require trains with more than 70 tank cars carrying oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids to be upgraded with electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake systems or hold their speed to 30 mph. This new rule presents a major opportunity for New York Air Brake Corp. and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp. (Wabtec), as they are the only two US companies that manufacture ECP brake systems for trains. Upgrading over 125,000 tank cars would equate to more than 1 billion in capital investment. While this would be beneficial for the two companies, they emphasize their focus on providing products that solve safety problems rather than solely capitalizing on new regulations."},{"prompt":"When I was home, I was comfortable.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

While some have estimated 20,000 stray dogs roam the city, studies have shown the true number to be around 1,000-3,000. Roughly half of the owners of Detroit's 305,000 properties failed to pay their 2011 tax bills, resulting in about 246 million in taxes and fees going uncollected, nearly half of which was due to Detroit; the rest of the money would have been earmarked for Wayne County, Detroit Public Schools, and the library system.","completion":"The city would empty out some of the problem areas by demolishing abandoned homes and buildings, removing street lighting from large portions of the city, and encouraging the small population in certain areas to move to more populated locations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option.

Given the context: What does Riley need to do before this? Select from the following. (I). find the teacher (II). drive the car (III). make new friends Answer:","completion":"Before Riley transfers to a new school and meets her teacher for the first time, there are several essential steps she needs to take, some of which might include a combination of the given options. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Research and select the new school: Before transferring to a new school, Riley and her parents should take the time to research different schools in their area, considering factors such as educational quality, school culture, distance from home, and any specific programs or extracurricular activities that Riley is interested in. Once they have gathered enough information, they can make an informed decision on which school to attend. 2. Complete the transfer process: Riley and her parents will need to complete the necessary paperwork to transfer from her previous school to the new one. This process may involve providing documents such as academic records, proof of residency, immunization records, and other relevant information. The schools might also require an interview or a meeting to discuss the transfer. 3. Familiarize with the new school environment: Before starting at the new school, it's essential for Riley to become familiar with her new surroundings. She should take a tour of the school grounds, locate her classrooms, and identify key areas such as the library, cafeteria, restrooms, and administration offices. Familiarizing herself with the layout can help make her first day less stressful. 4. (I) Find the teacher: On her first day at the new school, one of the most crucial tasks for Riley is to find her teacher. She should consult her class schedule, take note of her teacher's name, and find the location of her classrooms. Introducing herself before the class starts will help establish a relationship with the teacher and make her feel more comfortable. 5. (III) Make new friends: As Riley is new to the school, it's important for her to make an effort to form connections and make friends with her peers. She should try to be open and approachable, engage in conversations, join clubs or extracurricular activities, and participate in school events. Making new friends will not only make her feel more comfortable and supported but also help her adapt more quickly to her new environment. 6. Focus on academics and extracurricular activities: Once Riley has successfully transferred to the new school and has started establishing relationships with her teacher and peers, she should prioritize her academics and any extracurricular activities. Maintaining a consistent study schedule, staying organized, and seeking help or support when needed can help her thrive academically in her new environment. While driving a car (option II) may certainly be a part of the overall process, especially if Riley is moving to a new area or if her parents drive her to and from school, the more critical steps to consider in the context of transferring to a new school and meeting her teacher would be exploring the new school environment, finding her teacher, and making new friends."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Possible bug Can't select anything button in middle of arrows doesn't do anything ???

By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 23:01 EST, 2 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 23:01 EST, 2 November 2013. Bernhard Goetz, the controversial 'Subway Vigilante' who shot four teenagers on the New York subway in 1984, has been charged with misdemeanor sale and possession of marijuana, authorities said Saturday. The 65-year-old was arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court on three misdemeanor drug charges for sale and possession of marijuana. He was released on his own recognizance and is due back in court next month. Goetz became a public figure after he shot four black youths he claimed were going to mug him, prompting debate over race relations and frustration with high crime rates of New York in the 1980s. Charged: Bernard Goetz stands with attorney Danielle Iredale, as he is arraigned in Manhattan criminal court, in New York. Out and about: Bernie Goetz seen on the streets of Manhattan in February 2012. It has been reported that he was arrested for trying to make a pot deal with an undercover cop on Friday. Goetz was nabbed in a sting operation in. Union Square park Friday evening for selling 30 worth of marijuana to. an undercover officer, police said. He asked the woman if she wanted to get. high, then went back to his apartment, where he has lived for decades,. and returned with marijuana, authorities said. He was arrested on. charges of criminal sale of marijuana. According to The Post, Goetz was arrested on the street at about 5.45pm after getting into conversation with the police officer. A police source said: 'He told her he wanted to get high with her and sold her a small amount of pot in a tissue.' Courting controversy: Bernhard Goetz leaves Manhattan criminal court in New York on Saturday. Goetz wasn't being targeted specifically; he just happened to cross paths with the undercover officer assigned to crack down on drug dealing in the park, authorities said. After a tumultuous trial in 1985 that attracted much media attention, Goetz was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault. With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense. Goetz ended up serving eight months in jail, but his legacy lasted much longer than his time in the big house. He went on to become an activist for a tougher focus on crime, and he proceeded to run for mayor of the city in 2001 and the city's public advocate in 2005. Scene: Goetz shot four black youths he claimed were going to rob him on the subway in December 1984. With New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense. Neither bid was successful, but Goetz traded in on his given nickname by opening an repair store called Vigilante Electronics. His case came back up in the press in December 2011 when one of the four men he shot killed himself in an apparent suicidal drug overdose on the 27th anniversary of the attack. James Ramseur was found dead in the Paradise Motor Inn in the Bronx. Ramseur was the youngest of four teens who surrounded Goetz on the 2 train on December 22, 1984. Believing the group was about to rob him, Goetz pulled out a .38 calibre revolver and fired, striking each of them once. Ramseur was shot in the chest, but survived. The other teenagers - Barry Allen, Troy Canty and Darrell Cabey - were also hospitalized and were not killed. Cabey was left paralyzed by the bullet that struck him. Controversial: Goetz was a divisive figure but was only found guilty of criminal possession of a weapon and innocent of all four counts of attempted murder and assault. Goetz was briefly a fugitive, but turned himself in to police a little more than a week later in Concord, New Hampshire. Goetz claimed it was self-defense, alleging the youths intended to rob him. During the trial, Ramseur testified that they were panhandling, and not demanding money from Goetz, but it was later reported that the group was intending to mug him. Goetz was convicted of a gun charge but acquitted of attempted murder. Three of the suspects were found to have screwdrivers at the time of the shooting, which the suspects claimed were used to break into arcade games to steal quarters, not as weapons. Goetz filed for bankruptcy shortly after Cabey won a 43 million lawsuit against him. Cabey's attorney, Ron Kuby, said Saturday his client remains paralyzed in a wheelchair and has never received a penny from Goetz.

Malpighian tubules are the outpocketings of the digestive tract that remove nitrogenous wastes and function in osmoregulation. They are primarily found in arthropods, like insects and spiders, and play a critical role in their excretory and osmoregulatory systems. These tubules are named after the Italian scientist Marcello Malpighi, who first described them in the 17th century. Arthropods are among the largest and most diverse groups of animals and are known for their unique excretory systems that help them remove waste products and maintain a proper water balance within their bodies. Malpighian tubules are a crucial component of this system, providing a highly efficient means of waste removal and osmoregulation with minimal energy expenditure. These tubules are usually found in clusters near the junction between the midgut and hindgut of the arthropod digestive tract. They are slender, blind-ended tubes that float freely in the hemolymph, the arthropod's blood equivalent. The number of tubules can vary widely, depending on the species, ranging from a few dozen in some insects to several hundred in others. At the cellular level, Malpighian tubules are lined with specialized epithelial cells that possess numerous microvilli, increasing their surface area for more efficient absorption and secretion. The inner side of these cells faces a central lumen, which ultimately empties into the hindgut. The cells actively transport ions, like potassium and sodium, from the hemolymph into the lumen, creating an osmotic gradient that drives water and other solutes to follow. Nitrogenous wastes, such as ammonia, are converted into less toxic compounds like uric acid or guanine before being transported into the lumen, where they combine with water, salts, and other waste products to form urine. This urine then moves down the tubules and is eventually eliminated from the body through the hindgut and anus. In addition to waste removal, Malpighian tubules play a vital role in osmoregulation, as the movement of ions and water across the tubule walls helps maintain the proper balance of fluids within the arthropod's body. This is particularly important for terrestrial arthropods that live in environments with varying humidity levels. By controlling the amount of water reabsorbed into the hemolymph or lost to the environment, Malpighian tubules help these animals conserve water and maintain the appropriate internal osmotic balance. In summary, Malpighian tubules are the outpocketings of the digestive tract in arthropods that primarily function in removing nitrogenous wastes and maintaining appropriate osmotic balance within the body. Their unique structure and cellular organization enable these tubules to carry out efficient waste removal and osmoregulation with minimal energy expenditure, making them a critical part of the arthropod excretory system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane? is inside the article: In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim., can you guess it ?

Article: A practical English Grammar is intended for intermediate and post-intermediate students. We hope that more advanced learners and teachers will also find it useful. The book is a comprehensive survey of structures and forms, written in clear modern English and illustrated with numerous examples. Areas of particular difficulty have been given special attention. Differences between conversational usage and strict grammatical forms are shown but the emphasis is on controversial forms. In the fourth edition the main changes are as follows. 1. Explanation and examples have been brought up to date. 2. There is now more information on countable and uncountable nouns, attributive and predicative adjectives, adverbs of place, sentence adverbs, cleft sentences, prepositions, conjunctives, modal verbs, perfect tenses, infinitive constructions, the passive, purpose clauses and nouns. 3. Some material has been rearranged to make comparisons easier. For example, parts of chapters on can, may, must etc. are now grouped by functions; verbs of liking and preference have a chapter to themselves; suggestions and invitations have joined the chapter on commands, requests and advice. 4. The contents list now summaries every edition heading, and there is a new index containing many more entries references. In this edition the sign \\"~\\" is frequently used to show a change of speaker in examples of dialogue. Note also that although the sign \\"=\\"\\"\\" sometimes connects two words or expressions with the same meaning, it is often used more freely, e.g. to indicate a transformation from active to passive or direct to indirect speech. We wish to thank all at Oxford University Press who have assisted in the preparation of the fourth edition. We would also like to thank Professor Egawa of Nihon University, Japan, Professor Rene Dirven of Duisburg University, West Germany and other colleagues for their friendly and helpful suggestions.

Article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Haqqani network has been blamed for a series of deadly recent attacks in the Afghan capital, the BBC's Nick Childs reports A key leader of the Afghan militant group, the Haqqani network, has told the BBC it was not responsible for killing Burhanuddin Rabbani, the man overseeing Taliban peace talks. Afghan officials have blamed the Taliban-affiliated network for the suicide attack on Rabbani. Siraj Haqqani also told BBC Pashto his network was not linked to Pakistan's spy agency, the ISI. Mr Haqqani was giving an audio response to written questions from the BBC. Security considerations ruled out a face-to-face interview in which the answers could be challenged, but the BBC understands that the audio response is genuine. The questions were delivered through an intermediary, who returned with the audio response. Siraj Haqqani is the son of group founder Jalaluddin Haqqani and has a key role in its operations. Analysis In quite subtle remarks, Siraj Haqqani uses his BBC interview to deny taking orders from Pakistan's intelligence service, the ISI. He said he'd been in contact with a lot of countries intelligence agencies, including Pakistan, but had not heard anything \\"to his benefit\\". Don't expect that to make any difference to the diplomatic offensive Afghanistan is waging against Pakistan now, in the belief that the ISI is indeed waging a proxy war on its soil, using groups like the Haqqanis. Siraj Haqqani also said that the Americans, among others, had been in touch to try to persuade him to enter talks with the Afghan government. That statement is credible, given the efforts which have apparently been going on behind the scenes to get some kind of peace process going (though for the time being, President Karzai, seems to want a halt to efforts to engage with the militants directly, preferring to talk instead to Pakistan). The Haqqani network has a 30-year history as a guerrilla force. To their supporter, they are fighting occupiers now, just as they did the Soviets. To their detractors, the Haqqanis are as much a crime family as a group of Islamist ideologues. They are accused of running protection rackets, smuggling gemstones, and carrying out kidnappings for money. Some believe that if they are behind the recent attacks in Kabul, that may be about securing a place at the table in any future peace negotiations and a slice of the spoils. The Haqqanis have been blamed for a series of deadly recent attacks in Kabul. 'Military council' Burhanuddin Rabbani was killed at his home in Kabul on 20 September when meeting a man who said he was carrying an important peace message from the Taliban. The man detonated a bomb hidden in his turban. In his interview response, Siraj Haqqani simply says: \\"We haven't killed Burhanuddin Rabbani and this has been said many times by the spokespersons of the Islamic Emirate.\\" The Islamic Emirate is the name the Taliban gave to Afghanistan when they took control in 1996. The Taliban have said they do not wish to comment on the Rabbani killing. Afghan investigators say the killer was a Pakistani and that the murder was plotted in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Afghan government officials have also accused the Pakistan intelligence agency, the ISI, of involvement, a charge Islamabad denies. Afghanistan and the US have both accused the ISI of links to the Haqqani network. Mr Haqqani said the \\"Islamic Emirate\\" was behind \\"the attack on the US embassy, Nato headquarters and other attacks\\" in Kabul, which he said were ordered by a \\"military council\\" and were not the work of individuals. ISI links denied In relation to links to the ISI, Mr Haqqani said that during the Soviet occupation of the 1980s, mujahideen fighters \\"had contacts with the intelligence agencies of Pakistan and other countries, but after the invasion by the Americans there have never been contacts by intelligence agencies of other countries which could be effective for us\\". He said the Haqqanis \\"have been contacted and are being contacted by intelligence agencies of many Islamic and non-Islamic countries, including the US, asking us to leave the sacred jihad and take an important part in the current government\\". Mr Haqqani said that was not his network's responsibility, but he added: \\"We know that their aim is not peace, they want to create tension among the Emirate's mujahideen.\\" He said accusations of links to the ISI were an attempt \\"to hide their failure and to confuse peoples' minds\\". A senior Afghan intelligence official rejected the Haqqanis' denial of links to the ISI, saying the group was the ISI's creation. \\"The ISI gives the network intelligence, tactical advice and training. Groups like Lashkar-e Taiba give [the network] fighters and share information and experience about battles,\\" the official told the BBC. \\"We know for sure that Lashkar-e Taiba fighters come and fight alongside the Haqqani network. The Haqqanis fight alongside Lashkar-e Taiba in Kashmir. They have a longstanding relationship.\\" Analysts say the Haqqanis' denial of an ISI connection works to Islamabad's advantage, which has been under pressure from the US because of its ties to the militants. \\"Pakistan fears the US, so Siraj [Haqqani] is giving an interview to change public perception about its ties to the ISI,\\" political analyst Haroun Mir told the BBC. If the Haqqanis were in contact with the Americans, this would be via Pakistan, said author and analyst Ahmed Rashid. \\"The [US] mood has changed against the Haqqanis... It is not that the talks with the Haqqanis are like the talks with the mainstream Taliban, which I think are genuine and more constructive talks, \\" he told the BBC. \\"There are probably contacts with the Pakistanis acting as a liaison.\\" Command structure Mr Haqqani vowed that \\"the game which is being played by the West... is close to an end\\". Image caption Burhanuddin Rabbani was killed by a bomb hidden in a turban He pledged loyalty to Mullah Omar, saying he \\"is our leader and we totally obey him\\". \\"In every operation we get the order, planning and financial resources from the Emirate's leadership and we act accordingly,\\" Mr Haqqani said. He also delivered a message to the \\"government and people of Pakistan\\", telling them to be \\"careful of their Islamic values. They should understand that America will not let Pakistan live a peaceful life until it destroys all the wealth and values of it.\\" After Rabbani's death, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government would no longer hold peace talks with the Taliban, but would instead focus on dialogue with Pakistan. Mr Karzai said: \\"[Taliban leader] Mullah Omar doesn't have an address... their peace emissary turns out to be a killer, whom should we talk to? \\"The Afghan nation asks me who's the other party that you hold talks with? My answer is, Pakistan.\\" ||||| CHARBARAN, Afghanistan — The first helicopter landed in the bluish gray gloom before dawn. More than 20 members of an American reconnaissance platoon and Afghan troops accompanying them jogged out through the swirling dust, moving into a forest smelling of sage and pine. Three more helicopters followed, and soon roughly 100 troops were on the floor of this high-elevation valley in Paktika Province, near the border with Pakistan. They were beginning their portion of a brigade-size operation to disrupt the Haqqani network, the insurgent group that collaborates with the Taliban and Al Qaeda and that has become a primary focus of American counterterrorism efforts since Osama bin Laden was killed. The group, based in Pakistan’s northwestern frontier, flows fighters into Afghanistan and has orchestrated a long campaign of guerrilla and terrorist attacks against the Afghan government and its American sponsors. Its close ties to Pakistan’s intelligence service, and Pakistan’s unwillingness to act against the Haqqani headquarters in Miram Shah, a city not far from the Afghan border, have drawn condemnation from Washington and escalated tensions between two nations that officially have been counterterrorism partners. Against this backdrop, the helicopter assault into Charbaran this past week highlighted both the false starts and the latest set of urgent goals guiding the American military involvement in Afghanistan. The Pentagon plans to have withdrawn most of its forces from the country by 2014. Talk among many officers has shifted sharply from discussions of establishing Afghan democracy or a robust government to a more pragmatic and realistic military ambition: doing what can be done in the little time left. In the tactical sense, this translates to straightforward tasks for units in the security buffer along the border. While they still have their peak troop presence, American commanders are trying to bloody the strongest of the armed antigovernment groups and to put thousands more Afghan police officers and soldiers into contested areas. The long-term ambition is that Afghan forces will have the skills and resolve to stand up to the insurgency as the Americans pull back. And yet, even while looking beyond 2014, American units must fight a day-to-day war. One element lies in trying to prevent more of the carefully planned attacks that have shaken Kabul, the Afghan capital, several times this year. The attacks — striking prominent targets, like the capital’s premier hotel and the American Embassy — have often been organized by the Haqqanis, and have highlighted the Afghan government’s vulnerability and the insurgents’ resiliency. Lt. Col. John V. Meyer, who commands the Second Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, which used two companies to cordon off the Charbaran Valley and another to sweep the villages, called the operation “a spoiling attack to prevent a spectacular attack in the Kabul area.” It was also intended, he said, to gather intelligence. The Charbaran Valley has become one of the main routes for Haqqani fighters to enter Afghanistan. They generally come in on foot, American officers say, and then, after staying overnight in safe houses and tent camps, they work their way toward Kabul or other areas where they have been sent to fight. Mid-level Haqqani leaders also meet in the valley’s villages, American officers said, including near an abandoned school and the ruins of a government center that the United States built earlier in the war but that local fighters had destroyed by 2008. It was 2010 when the last conventional unit entered the valley. An infantry company, it landed by helicopter and was caught in a two-hour gunfight as it left. When the American and Afghan troops fanned out this time, their mission faced a familiar law of guerrilla war: when conventional forces arrive in force, guerrillas often disperse, setting aside weapons to watch the soldiers pass by. |||||Summary:","completion":"A key leader of the Afghan militant group, the Haqqani network, has told the BBC that it was not responsible for killing Burhanuddin Rabbani, the man overseeing Taliban peace talks.

The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best known for their 190 short subject films by Columbia Pictures that have been regularly airing on television since 1958. Their hallmark was physical farce and slapstick. In films, the stooges were commonly known by their actual first names. There were a total of six stooges over the act's run (with only three active at any given time), but Moe Howard and Larry Fine were the mainstays throughout the ensemble's nearly fifty-year run and the pivotal \\"third Stooge\\" was played by (in order of appearance) On October 30, 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a two-disc DVD set entitled The Three Stooges Collection, Volume One: 1934-1936. The set contains shorts from the first three years the Stooges worked at Columbia Pictures, marking the first time ever that all 19 shorts were released in their original theatrical order to DVD. Additionally, every short was remastered in high definition, a first for the Stooge films. Previous DVD releases were based on themes (wartime, history, work, etc.), and sold poorly. Fans and critics alike praised Sony for finally giving the Stooges the proper DVD treatment. One critic states \\"the Three Stooges on DVD has been a real mix'n match hodgepodge of un-restored titles and illogical entries. This new...boxset...seems to be the first concerted effort to categorize their huge body of work chronologically with many shorts seeing the digital light for the first time.\\" Videolibrarian.com critic added \\"finally, the studio knuckleheads got it right! The way that the Three Stooges have been presented on home video has been a real slap in the face and poke in the eye to fans. They've been anthologized, colorized, and public domain-ed, as their shorts have been released and re-released in varying degrees of quality. Highly recommended.\\" Critic James Plath of DVDtown.com added, \\"Thank you, Sony, for finally giving these Columbia Pictures icons the kind of DVD retrospective that they deserve. Remastered in High Definition and presented in chronological order, these short films now give fans the chance to appreciate the development of one of the most successful comedy teams in history.\\" The chronological series proved successful, and Sony wasted little time preparing the next set for release. Volume Two: 1937-1939 was released on May 27, 2008, followed by Volume Three: 1940-1942 three months later on August 26, 2008. Demand exceeded supply, proving to Sony that they had a hit on their hands. In response, Volume Four: 1943-1945 was released on October 7, 2008, a mere two months after its predecessor. The global economic crisis slowed down the release schedule after Volume Four, and Volume Five: 1946-1948 was belatedly released on March 17, 2009. Volume Five is the first in the series to feature Shemp Howard with the Stooges and the final volume to feature Curly Howard. Volume Six: 1949-1951 was released June 16, 2009, and Volume Seven: 1952-1954 was released on November 10, 2009. Volume Seven included 3-D glasses for the two shorts: Spooks! and Pardon My Backfire. As of 2013, the 3-D versions of the two shorts in this volume have been removed. Volume Eight: 1955-1959 was released on June 1, 2010. This was the final volume of the Stooges collection, bringing the series to a close. Instead of two discs, Volume Eight includes three discs. It is also the final volume to feature Shemp Howard and the first and only volume to feature Joe Besser.

Plot title: Night of the Demon Movie plot: In England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) visits his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis). Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary. It reveals Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. There, Holden and Karswell mock each another's beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days. Holden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who had several siblings? Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England. Giving up her work as a governess, Fuller began to paint full-time, and had opened her own studio before she had...","completion":"The last name of the person who had several siblings is Fuller.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Which of the puppies likes the idea of working the flock more? from the following article ? One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern. Answer:","completion":"Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"If a company wanted to introduce a new heart medication, a qualified administration now has the final say thanks to what entity??\\" Context: \\"The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The introduction of a new heart medication requires final approval from a qualified administration, which is made possible by the existence of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This authority was established following the thalidomide tragedy, which resulted in the Kefauver-Harris Amendment becoming law on October 10, 1962, and aimed to enhance drug regulation in order to ensure both the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. Before a drug can be approved for market use in the United States, the FDA requires manufacturers to provide substantial evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of their products. This requirement was implemented as a result of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment and created a significant shift in the drug development and approval process, putting a greater emphasis on scientific research and rigorous evaluation. As part of this regulatory oversight, the FDA holds the authority to regulate the advertising of prescription drugs, ensuring that promotional materials are accurate and not misleading. Additionally, the agency has the power to establish Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) to guarantee the quality and consistency of drug products. In order to assess the efficacy of drugs that were released between 1938 and 1962, the FDA collaborated with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study. The results demonstrated that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective, highlighting the need for a more stringent approval process across the industry. A decade later, a similar study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of over-the-counter products, further emphasizing the importance of strong regulatory oversight. In conclusion, the final say on the approval of new heart medications and other pharmaceutical products in the United States lies with the FDA, an organization that gained this authority through the enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962. This legislation came into effect in response to the thalidomide tragedy and has since played a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs available to the American public. The FDA's regulatory powers have evolved to include the oversight of prescription drug advertising, establishing GMPs, and regularly reviewing the effectiveness of previously approved drugs, making it a critical entity in the pharmaceutical landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. and the situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Answer the following question: Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown? The answer is:","completion":"Dapperton will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown. The primary reason for this difference is the energy source used by each city for electricity generation. Jamestown relies on coal, which is a fossil fuel known for its significant contributions to air pollution and the generation of acidic compounds. When coal is burned, it releases a variety of harmful substances into the atmosphere, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These compounds react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the atmosphere to form acid rain. In contrast, Dapperton uses nuclear power as its primary electricity source. Nuclear fission, the process utilized by nuclear power plants, does not involve the combustion of fossil fuels that lead to the production of SO2 and NOx. As a result, nuclear facilities like those in Dapperton do not contribute to the formation of acidic compounds in the atmosphere. This substantially reduces the risk for acid rain in the city compared to the coal-dependent Jamestown. Furthermore, Jennifer's strong environmental convictions align more closely with the energy strategy employed by Dapperton. Her desire to minimize her individual impact on climate change indicates that she would likely prefer residing in a city that relies on nuclear power, which generally has a lower carbon footprint than coal-powered cities like Jamestown. In summary, Dapperton has a significantly lower chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Jamestown due to its reliance on nuclear power for electricity generation. This factor, along with Jennifer's environmental concerns, suggests that Dapperton would be a more suitable choice for her when considering a new city to call home."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They soon run into trouble, first narrowly avoiding another motorist, then having a sudden scare as the bridge near the cabin begins to collapse as they cross. That night, while Cheryl is making a drawing of a clock, her hand becomes violently possessed by a mysterious entity, causing her to draw a picture that looks like a book with a deformed, evil face. She fails to mention the incident to the others, dismissing it as her imagination. When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty go down to investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recording of incantations in which, when played by Ash then Scotty, unleashes demons and evil spirits. Cheryl becomes hysterical when a tree crashes through the window, and she runs to her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. She is attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. The others do not believe her story, but Ash agrees to drive her to town where she can find a place to stay for the night. However, they find that the only bridge connecting the cabin to the rest of the world has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape and while the girls play cards, Cheryl then becomes demonically possessed, telling them that the demons will kill them. She then stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil, and Scotty locks her in the cellar. Shelly is the next to become possessed; she attacks Scotty, who eventually dismembers her with an felling axe. They bury her, and a shaken Scotty leaves to find an alternate trail through the woods. Checking on Linda, Ash discovers that she too became possessed. Scotty...

Article: Likewise, Émile Durkheim was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings. In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups.

What happens if a teeter-totter is balanced? Correct! It does not move. What about when its not balanced? Yes, it will now begin to move. Charges move when they are not balanced. Charges can build up by friction. Maybe you rub your feet on a wool mat or carpet. Rubber soled shoes readily gain charges. The wool carpet easily gives up charges. The two items become unbalanced. One item has a positive charge. The other has a negative charge. The difference in charge is called static electricity. Just like the teeter-totter, something is going to move. Positive charges build up on the mat. Negative charges build up on you.

PARIS–Eric Asimov’s latest column in The New York Times on decanting wine reminds me that my own decanters see very little use – other than when they’re used to water the plants. I have three decanters, two for table wines and one, with a stopper, for port. This is what happens when you neglect to sign up for a wedding gift registry. Eric Pfanner in the domain of the grape. Eric Pfanner in the domain of the grape. All three are beautiful pieces of glassware, and I probably ought to use them more often for their intended purpose. Yet I find that the occasions for decanting wine, at least in my household, are few and far between. One reason is that, sadly, I do not open an old, rare wine, the kind that throws off a considerable amount of sediment and demands decanting, every night. As Eric writes, this is one of the two main reasons for decanting. The other, more debatable, reason is to aerate the wine. On this, I am somewhat more skeptical. Yes, I see the benefits of aeration, especially for tannic, closed young reds. These wines almost always taste better after they have been exposed to some air. Yet I find that simply opening the bottle a few hours in advance, or serving the wine in a generously sized glass and giving it a vigorous swirl, often does the job. The second or third glass almost always tastes better than the first, though this may not be entirely because of the air. I suspect, given that I live in Paris, some of the French attitude toward decanting has rubbed off on me, too. In my experience the French, outside the great temples of gastronomy, tend to attach less ceremony to the service of wine than, say, Americans, Britons or Germans do. Some of this probably reflects a tradition of treating wine as an everyday accompaniment to food. O.K., there may be an element of sloppiness, too. I’m often puzzled by the poor quality of glassware, generally, in many restaurants in France. Many of the best wine glasses are made by Austrians (Riedel) or Germans (Spiegelau) and restaurants in those countries, and elsewhere, tend to make use of them. The French are often happy to pour their grands crus into sad, industrially made glasses. I’ve also come across quite a few French vignerons – especially in Burgundy and the Rhône Valley — who are vehemently opposed to decanting, saying it actually hurts the taste of their wines. The fruit in red Burgundy can be very delicate; the violent act of decanting (I’m paraphrasing the French here) destroys it. There may be something to this. Few wines are more delicious than a red Burgundy, straight from the bottle, tasted in a vigneron’s cellar. How’s that for excuses for the lack of use of two of my three decanters? The third one, on the other hand, really ought to be filled up with some vintage port. Summary:","completion":"The author reminisces about their rarely-used decanters and discusses opinions on wine decanting. Eric Asimov's column in the New York Times highlights two reasons to decant: removing sediment from old wines and aerating wine to improve taste. The author finds both reasons valid but notes that decanting often isn't necessary for everyday wines and that opening the bottle a few hours ahead or serving it in a larger glass can achieve similar results. They also observe that French winemakers, particularly in Burgundy and Rhône Valley, sometimes disapprove of decanting, claiming it can hurt the wine's taste, highlighting that cultural preferences can influence attitudes toward decanting wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The win keeps Madrid's slim chances of overcoming leaders Barcelona alive, reducing the gap between them and their rivals to five points. Although Josep Guardiola's team can restore their eight-point lead with a win over Espanyol on Sunday evening. Sergio Ramos opened the scoring for Madrid after 22 minutes before Ronaldo weighed in with his first of the night nine minutes later, with Kaka adding a third before half-time. Alvaro Negredo pulled one back for the home side on the hour mark but three Ronaldo goals in the space of ten minutes shortly afterwards killed any hopes of a revival stone dead. Negredo bagged his second of the night with six minutes remaining but it was the Portuguese winger's night as his fourth goal saw him move one ahead of Lionel Messi's league goal tally of 32. In the earlier La Liga matches, Roberto Soldado scored twice as Valencia beat Real Sociedad 3-0. All goals came in the first half -- Soldado scoring in the 17th and 37th minutes while Brazilian Jonas Goncalves netted after 25 minutes. The win consolidates Valencia's grip on third place although Villarreal can reduce the gap from six to three points with a win over Mallorca on Sunday. Seventh-placed Atletico Madrid lost 3-0 to Malaga who recorded their fourth successive win in La Liga thanks to goals from Jose Salomon Rondon on the half-hour mark, followed by a Julio Baptista header five minutes later before Enzo Maresca added the third six minutes before the final whistle. Athletic Bilbao defeated Levante 3-2 as they continue their quest for a Europa League spot next season. Bilbao surged into a three goal lead after little more than a hour played with goals from Gaizka Toquero, David Lopez and Fernando Llorente. But Levante staged a late comeback banging in goals in the 77th minute (Christian Stuani) and in the 86th minute courtesy of Victoriano Nano to set up a tense climax, but the home side held on to claim the three points. Getafe gave their supporters hope that they might avoid relegation after a 2-0 win over bottom side Almeria. Goals from Adrian Colunga and Pedro Rios lifted them out of the relegation zone and up 15th place with 40 points. Racing Santander looked to have ensured their survival in La Liga after a 3-2 win over second-from-bottom Hercules. Giovani dos Santos opened the scoring for Santander in the 14th minute before Sendoa Agirre equalized for Hercules five minutes before halftime which ushered in a frantic passage of play. Giovani restored Santander's advantage a minute later, before Tiago Gomes made it 2-2. Henrique capped a madcap five minutes with a header in stoppage time and ultimately sealed the win for Santander. An injury-time penalty by striker David Barral saw Sporting Gijon salvage a 2-2 draw in their match against struggling Deportivo La Coruna.

Text: \`\`Article III federal judges'' (as opposed to judges of some courts with special jurisdictions) serve \`\`during good behavior'' (often paraphrased as appointed \`\`for life''). Judges hold their seats until they resign, die, or are removed from office. Although the legal orthodoxy is that judges cannot be removed from office except by impeachment by the House of Representatives followed by conviction by the Senate, several legal scholars, including William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash, and Steven D. Smith, have argued that the Good Behaviour Clause may, in theory, permit removal by way of a writ of scire facias filed before a federal court, without resort to impeachment. Question: can federal judges be removed by the president?","completion":"No, federal judges cannot be directly removed by the President of the United States. The process of removing a federal judge, as outlined in the United States Constitution under Article III, is designed to maintain judicial independence and prevent any single branch of government from exerting excessive control over the federal judiciary. According to the U.S. Constitution, Article III federal judges serve \\"during good behavior,\\" which effectively translates to life tenure. Federal judges can only leave their position if they choose to resign, die, or are removed from office following a specific legal process. For a federal judge to be removed from office, there must be grounds for impeachment, usually involving misconduct or unlawful behavior. The impeachment process starts in the House of Representatives, where a majority vote is required to bring formal charges against the judge. After the judge is impeached in the House, the case moves to the Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is required to convict and remove the judge from their position. While some legal scholars, such as William Rehnquist, Saikrishna Prakash, and Steven D. Smith, have argued that the Good Behaviour Clause may theoretically allow for removal by a writ of scire facias filed before a federal court, this approach has not been tested or applied in practice. Therefore, the generally accepted understanding is that a federal judge cannot be removed from office without impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. In summary, the President of the United States cannot directly remove a federal judge from their position. The constitutional process established for judicial removal involves impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate, upholding the ideal of judicial independence and ensuring a balance of power among the branches of government."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday.

No These questions do not share the same meaning, as they ask about different countries and their respective sources of pride in history. Each country has its own unique history, events, and individuals that have influenced and shaped its culture and national identity. 1. Libya is a North African country with a rich and diverse history influenced by ancient civilizations, Islamic empires and colonial rule. Some prominent individuals and events in Libyan history that arouse pride include: a) Hannibal-Barca: The famous Carthaginian military commander who became known for his remarkable campaigns against the Roman Empire in the Second Punic War. b) Queen Dihya: A 7th-century Berber warrior queen who led the resistance against the introduction of the Arab-Islamic expansion in North Africa. c) Omar Mukhtar: A historical figure and symbol of resistance, who fought against Italian colonial occupation in the early 20th century. His leadership and dedication to the struggle continues to inspire Libyans today. d) The Libyan Independence Movement: Led by King Idris I, it achieved independence from Italy and the United Kingdom, and established the Kingdom of Libya in 1951. 2. Australia is a diverse nation with a rich history shaped by its indigenous people, European settlers and immigrants from all over the world. Some individuals and events in Australian history that evoke national pride include: a) Aboriginal history and culture: The indigenous peoples of Australia have a rich history and culture stretching back over 50,000 years, evidenced through ancient art, cultural sites and oral traditions. b) James Cook: A British explorer who made the first recorded European contact with the eastern coast of Australia in 1770, opening the way for British colonization and the development of a new nation. c) The Eureka Rebellion: A pivotal event in Australian history that represents the struggle for democracy and social justice. It took place in 1854 when gold miners in Ballarat, Victoria, revolted against perceived injustices in the colonial administration. d) The ANZAC spirit: The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) fought bravely during World War I, particularly in the Gallipoli Campaign. The spirit of camaraderie, courage, and endurance displayed by these soldiers continues to be a source of national pride and is commemorated annually on ANZAC Day. In summary, the questions address distinct historical contexts – centred around Libya and Australia – and seek to identify their unique sources of pride within these contexts. While both nations share certain human qualities such as resilience and the fight for independence, the specific individuals and events that are causes for pride vastly differ due to their unique historical trajectories and cultural identities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step! First, we have -3000 * f, which means \\"minus 3000 times f\\". We need to find the value of f. Now, let's simplify the equation: 1. We have -67906, which means \\"minus 67,906\\". 2. We have +59027, which means \\"plus 59,027\\". 3. We have -108121, which means \\"minus 108,121\\". Let's add and subtract these numbers: -67906 (minus 67,906) + 59027 (plus 59,027) - 108121 (minus 108,121) We can first add -67906 and +59027: -67906 + 59027 = -8899 Now, let's subtract -108121 from -8899: -8899 - 108121 = -117020 So our equation now becomes: -3000 * f = -117020 Now we will divide both sides of the equation by -3000 to find \\"f\\": f = -117020 / -3000 When we do that division, we get: f = 39 So, the solution is f = 39.

These cold-blooded animals require specific and stable environmental conditions in order to thrive and survive in captivity. A vivarium—a space designed to mimic a reptile's natural habitat—is essential for their well-being. This article will explore the crucial elements in creating an optimal environment for reptile vivariums, highlighting the importance of heat sources, temperature regulation, light cycles, and proper vivarium placement. 1. Provide a Heat Source: Reptiles are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. In a vivarium, it is crucial to provide an appropriate heat source that caters to the specific species' needs. Heat sources can be categorized into two main types: - Primary Heat Source: The primary heat source is typically used to maintain the overall temperature of the vivarium. This can include heat mats, heat cables, and ceramic heat emitters. It is important to note that these heat sources do not provide visible light and should be used in conjunction with a separate light source. - Secondary Heat Source: Also known as a basking area, the secondary heat source provides a concentrated spot for reptiles to bask under and absorb warmth. This can include halogen bulbs, mercury vapor bulbs, or specialized reptile basking bulbs. 2. Keep the Temperature Regulated: Temperature regulation is crucial for the reptile's overall health, as they rely on their environment to meet their metabolic and physiological needs. Maintaining stable temperatures prevents stress, helps with digestion, and promotes healthy growth. To ensure proper temperature regulation in the vivarium, consider these guidelines: - Invest in a good-quality thermostat to control and monitor the temperature. Some thermostats can be programmed to automatically regulate the temperature by turning on or off the heat sources as needed. - Create a temperature gradient within the vivarium, with one side being warmer than the other. This allows the reptile to self-regulate its body temperature by migrating between the cooler and warmer zones. - Use a reliable thermometer, ideally a digital one with a probe, to accurately measure the temperatures in different areas of the vivarium. 3. Provide a Daily Cycle of Light and Dark: Reptiles depend on light for several biological functions, such as thermoregulation, digestion, activity level, and reproduction. A proper day/night cycle should be established to mimic their natural environment. This can be achieved by: - Using a timer to automatically turn on and off the light sources, thereby regulating the light and dark cycles. A recommended ratio is 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness, although this may vary depending on the species of reptile. - Ensuring a UVB light source is provided for reptiles that require natural sunlight for vitamin D3 synthesis—a crucial element in calcium metabolism. Be sure to check the specific needs of your reptile species and choose a suitable UVB lamp that caters to their requirements. 4. Place the Vivarium Away from Anything That Will Affect the Temperature: The environmental conditions inside the vivarium can be influenced by external factors. To maintain a stable and consistent environment, it is important to place the vivarium away from elements that could impact temperature and humidity levels. Consider the following when selecting a suitable location: - Avoid placing the vivarium in direct sunlight, as it could lead to overheating and adversely affect the internal temperatures. - Keep the vivarium away from drafts and air-conditioning vents, which could cause unwanted fluctuations in temperature. - Position the vivarium in a quiet and undisturbed area where sudden noises or disturbances are minimized, as this helps reduce stress and anxiety in the reptile. Conclusion: Creating an optimal environment for reptile vivariums requires an understanding of the animals' specific needs and environmental preferences. By providing the appropriate heat source, regulating temperature, ensuring suitable light and dark cycles, and carefully selecting the vivarium's placement, you can create a thriving and healthy habitat for your reptile companions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"When you exhale, why does air leave your lungs?\\" is \\"Due to increase in air pressure\\"?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. When you exhale, air leaves your lungs due to an increase in air pressure inside the lungs. This increase in air pressure is a result of the diaphragm muscle relaxing and the size of the chest cavity decreasing, forcing the air out of the lungs and through the respiratory tract, and eventually out of the body via the nose or mouth. Exhalation is a vital part of the breathing process in humans, as it allows for the removal of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, from the body and makes room for the fresh, oxygen-rich air needed for the next inhalation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Born Lucille Fay LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, the youngest and third child of Anna Bell (Johnson) and Thomas E. LeSueur, a laundry laborer. She was of English, French Huguenot, Swedish, and Irish ancestry. Crawford's elder siblings were sister Daisy LeSueur, who died before Lucille's birth, and brother Hal LeSueur. Crawford's father abandoned the family a few months before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. Context: On May 8, 1977, Crawford gave away her beloved Shih Tzu, \\"Princess Lotus Blossom,\\" being too weak to care for her. Crawford died two days later at her New York apartment of a heart attack. A funeral was held at Campbell Funeral Home, New York, on May 13, 1977. In her will, which was signed on October 28, 1976, Crawford bequeathed to her two youngest children, Cindy and Cathy, 77,500 each from her 2,000,000 estate. She explicitly disinherited the two eldest, Christina and Christopher: \\"It is my intention to make no provision herein for my son, Christopher, or my daughter, Christina, for reasons which are well known to them\\". She also bequeathed nothing to her niece, Joan Lowe (1933-1999; born Joan Crawford LeSueur, the only child of her estranged brother, Hal). Crawford left money to her favorite charities: the U.S.O. of New York, the Motion Picture Home, the American Cancer Society, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Heart Association, and the Wiltwyck School for Boys. A memorial service was held for Crawford at All Souls' Unitarian Church on Lexington Avenue in New York on May 16, 1977, and was attended by, among others, her old Hollywood friend Myrna Loy. Another memorial service, organized by George Cukor, was held on June 24 in the Samuel Goldwyn Theater at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills. Crawford was cremated and her ashes were placed in a crypt with her fourth and final husband, Alfred Steele, in Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, New York. Joan Crawford's handprints and footprints are immortalized in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1752 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

Answer based on context: Jay Cutler made his return to action against the 4-9 Cleveland Browns, a move that was criticized by fans. In November, a poll conducted by the Chicago Sun-Times revealed that fans favored Josh McCown with 66.87 percent, with Cutler earning 29.31 percent. On December 9, ESPN analyst Skip Bayless tweeted, \\"As much as I've supported Vanderbilt's own Jay Cutler, I must admit Josh McCown runs this offense like he owns it.\\" Bleacher Report's Dilan Ames stated that although Cutler is the better quarterback, his injury tendencies and inability to play a full season since 2009 had affected him, along with the statistics comparison between the two quarterbacks: Cutler has recorded 1,908 yards, 13 touchdowns and eight interceptions, while McCown has thrown for 1,809 yards, 13 touchdowns and one interception. However, Brandon Marshall defended Cutler's status as the starter, stating: McCown also acknowledged his backup position on the team, and told the Chicago Tribune, \\"The way that I serve my team is to play when the starter is not healthy. Jay is our starting quarterback, there is no doubt about that.\\" Seven CBS Sports analysts predicted a Bears victory, with Pete Prisco being the only one to favor the Browns. Jeff Joniak stated that the Bears had to attack the Browns' 3-4 defense, who ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed at 5.32, with their fifth-ranked passing offense. Chicago's wide receiver duo of Marshall and Alshon Jeffery should also be utilized, as Joe Haden and Buster Skrine are at a size mismatch (Marshall is 5 inches and 40 pounds larger than Haden, while Jeffery is 6 inches and 30 pounds heavier than Skrine). Browns offensive coordinator Ray Horton commented, \\"This team, Chicago, is a lot like Detroit in that they have weapons at every position. Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have the most catches in the league. They have the most combined yards in the league. They are both, in our mind, No. 1 receivers. They present a challenge that you can't double everybody. You can't roll up to one guy because the other guy's open.\\" On defense, the Bears had to contain Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Gordon ranks second in yards after catch, while leading all receivers with 71 for an average of 19.7 yards. Cameron leads all tight ends with 23 third down catches. The Bears' worst-ranked run defense also has to defend against the Browns, which had the third-fewest rushing attempts in the league with 290 with an average of 3.78 yards, which is one of the bottom six in the league. The Bears' opening drive ended at Cleveland's 14-yard line when Cutler had his pass tipped in the endzone by T. J. Ward and intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. The Browns then scored on Billy Cundiff's 35-yard field goal, which was tied by Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yarder. Eventually, the Bears reached the Browns' 24-yard line on another drive, and after a penalty on Alshon Jeffery forced the Bears to kick a 46-yard field goal, the score was nullified by Corey Wootton's holding penalty, forcing Chicago to punt. With 8:01 in the first half, Cutler was again intercepted by Gipson, who returned the pick 44 yards for a touchdown and the 10-3 lead. With 24 seconds remaining in the half, Cutler connected on a 5-yard touchdown pass with Marshall to close the half at 10-10. Cutler ended the first half with 13 of 19 passes completed for 168 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Early in the third quarter, Jason Campbell's pass for Greg Little was intercepted by Zack Bowman and returned 43 yards for the score. Cleveland's Edwin Baker eventually scored his first career NFL touchdown on a 2-yard run, and the Browns added to the score when Billy Winn punched the ball from Martellus Bennett, and Ward returned the fumble 52 yards for the 24-17 advantage. Eventually, Cutler guided the Bears from their own 5-yard line, culminating in a 45-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery after Gipson made an ill-timed leap and Julian Posey being unable to interrupt the play with 10:59 remaining. With 5:41 left in the game, Cutler threw a 5-yard pass to Earl Bennett to take the 31-24 lead, which was extended by Michael Bush on a 40-yard touchdown run. Cutler's touchdown pass to Bennett was the twenty-ninth passing touchdown of the season, which ties the team record set in 1947 and 1995. With 1:03 to go, Campbell threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Josh Gordon, but the Bears recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the victory, 38-31. The win marked the third time since 1970 that the Bears won all four games against an AFC division, and the first since 1986. The following night, the Bears would jump to first place of the NFC North after the Lions were defeated by the Ravens.

This incident occurred during the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, where US gymnast Paul Hamm and South Korean gymnast Yang Tae-young were part of a controversy involving the all-around gold medal. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) is the worldwide governing body for gymnastics, which oversees and regulates competitions and establishes rules for both national and international events. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, Paul Hamm, the American gymnast, initially won the gold medal in the men's artistic gymnastics all-around competition. However, a scoring error was found in Yang Tae-young's parallel bars routine. The base score, which is the value of the elements performed in the routine, was incorrectly recorded as 9.9 rather than the correct 10.0. This error deprived Yang of 0.1 points from his total, making the difference between him earning bronze and potentially winning gold. If the correct score had been awarded, Yang Tae-young would have won the gold medal and Paul Hamm the silver. After recognizing the scoring error, the International Gymnastics Federation asked Paul Hamm to give his gold medal to Yang Tae-young, igniting a debate on ethics, sportsmanship, and the fair resolution of such controversies. Ultimately, the FIG announced that despite the scoring error, they would not adjust the results or ask Hamm to give up his medal. The main reason given was that the South Korean team had failed to lodge an official protest in time, and changing the results after the competition could set a dangerous precedent. The decision sparked further discussions on the fairness and transparency in gymnastics and sports competitions in general. The incident involving Paul Hamm and Yang Tae-young at the 2004 Athens Olympics is a notable example of a sports-related controversy which highlights the importance of precision and accuracy in scoring and judging systems. This event also underlines the necessity of updating administrative procedures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and maintaining fair competition in international sports events."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Naftidrofuryl is marketed under the trade names Artocoron ; Azunaftil ; Di - Actane ; Dusodril ; Enelbin ; Frilix ; Gevatran ; Iridus ; Iridux ; Luctor ; Nafti ; Naftoling ; Naftodril ; Nafoxal ; Praxilene ; Sodipryl retard ; Vascuprax . Historically , it has been used to treat sudden idiopathic hearing loss and acute tinnitus . Naftidrofuryl may be effective for relieving the pain of muscle cramps . - Dimethyl oxalate is a chemical compound from the group of oxalates (specifically, the dimethyl ester of oxalic acid). - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the arteries other than those that supply the heart or the brain. When narrowing occurs in the heart it is called coronary artery disease while in the brain it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved. The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest, known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms including skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or poor nail and hair growth may occur in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation; coronary artery disease, or stroke. Up to 50% of cases of PAD are without symptoms. The main risk factor is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol. The underlying mechanism is usually atherosclerosis. Other causes include artery spasm. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks. It is unclear if screening for disease is useful as it has not been properly studied. In those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy improves outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol also may help. Aspirin does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended in those with more significant disease. Anticoagulants such as warfarin are not typically of benefit. Procedures used to treat the disease include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy. In 2010 about 202 million people had PAD worldwide. In the developed world it affects about 5.3% of 45 to 50 years olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the...

Let's solve this equation step by step, like a simple puzzle. We have: -42*v + 1020 = -308*v + 11*v First, let's combine the \\"v\\" terms. We have -308*v and 11*v on the right side of the equation. When we add those two together, we get: -308*v + 11*v = -297*v Now, the equation looks like this: -42*v + 1020 = -297*v Next, we want to get all the \\"v\\" terms onto one side of the equation. Let's add 297*v to both sides: -42*v + 297*v + 1020 = -297*v + 297*v This simplifies to: 255*v + 1020 = 0 Now, we want to isolate \\"v\\" by getting rid of the 1020. To do that, we'll subtract 1020 from both sides: 255*v + 1020 - 1020 = 0 - 1020 This simplifies to: 255*v = -1020 We're almost there! Now, we'll divide both sides by 255 to find the value of \\"v\\": 255*v / 255 = -1020 / 255 Now we have: v = -4 And there you go! The solution for \\"v\\" is -4.

Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too. Besides different types of gas, we can also use electricity to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines and make electricity more easily and cheaply. We are also able to get power from the ocean tides.

A:","completion":"This review would most likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The review points out several aspects that may influence prospective buyers in making a decision: 1. Video and sound quality: The reviewer states that the video has good picture and sound quality, which is a positive aspect of the product. However, this alone may not be enough to sway a potential buyer if the other aspects are unsatisfactory. 2. Authenticity: The reviewer raises concerns about the authenticity of the product, particularly mentioning the lack of the original drummer and lead singer, Peter Rivera. This could be a significant issue for fans of Rare Earth who want to experience the band's original lineup and sound, as opposed to a substitute or imitation. This would decrease the chances of buying the product for those who value authenticity and connection to the original artists. 3. Quality of performance: The reviewer describes the product as \\"just an average copy band,\\" indicating that the performance and overall quality may not be as high as expected for devoted fans of Rare Earth. This comment might lead potential buyers to doubt the level of enjoyment and satisfaction they would derive from purchasing and watching the video. 4. Risk and uncertainty: Lastly, the reviewer ends by suggesting that buying the product may be a gamble, with the phrase \\"take your chances.\\" This could further discourage potential buyers as they might interpret this statement as implying that there is a possibility they will regret the purchase.

I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'.

Plot title: Midnight in Paris Movie plot: Gil (Owen Wilson), a successful but distracted Hollywood screenwriter, and his fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams), are in Paris, vacationing with Inez's wealthy, conservative parents (Mimi Kennedy, Kurt Fuller). Gil is struggling to finish his first novel, which is about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, but Inez and her parents are critical and dismissive of Gil's desire to give up his lucrative Hollywood career to write it. While Gil is considering moving to the city, Inez is intent on living in Malibu. By chance, they are joined by Inez's friend Paul (Michael Sheen), a pseudo-intellectual who speaks with great authority but little actual accuracy on the history and art of the city. Inez idolizes him, but Gil, who is an ardent admirer of the Lost Generation, finds him insufferable.Paul and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda) invite Inez and Gil to go dancing. Inez accepts but Gil declines and chooses to return to the hotel through the streets of Paris, eventually becoming lost. As he stops, bells chime midnight and an antique car pulls up, and the passengers dressed in 1920s clothingurge Gil to join them. They go to a bar, where Gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the 1920s, an era he admires and idolizes in the novel he is writing. He encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), and Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston), who take him to meet Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Hemingway agrees to show Gil's novel to Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), and Gil goes to fetch his manuscript from his hotel. However, as soon as he leaves the bar, he finds he has returned to 2010.Gil attempts to bring Inez to the past with him the following night, but while they wait, she gets bored, and peevishly returns to the hotel. Just after she leaves, the clock strikes midnight and the car pulls up again, this time with Hemingway inside it.

Question: Question: Where is the best place to make food? Options: - kitchen - supermarket - table - stomach - restaurant The answer is \\"kitchen\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"kitchen\\" because a kitchen is specifically designed and equipped for preparing and cooking food. It typically contains necessary appliances, utensils, and ample space needed to handle various ingredients and cooking techniques. The other options do not provide the same level of functionality and convenience for making food: 1. Supermarket: A supermarket is a place where raw ingredients and prepackaged food items are sold, not prepared. While you can purchase the necessary items for making food, it does not have the tools or proper environment to prepare and cook the food. 2. Table: While a table can sometimes provide a flat surface for technically assembling food such as making a sandwich, it lacks the specialized equipment, facilities, and cleanliness of a kitchen. 3. Stomach: A stomach is an organ responsible for digesting food, not for making or preparing it. 4. Restaurant: Although a restaurant typically does have a kitchen, it is a place where prepared food is served to customers, not where individuals typically make their own food. A restaurant's kitchen can be an appropriate place for trained chefs to make food for customers, but it is not the ideal place for everyday people to prepare their meals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Well, I've got the details about different jobs and I'd like your opinion about which would be the best one to go for. F: Where are the jobs? M: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. F: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. M: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. F: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends! M: But, one problem with Munich is that it's growing very fast. That means the cost of living will probably be very high. F: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility. From the point of view of career progression that would probably be the best job for me. F: Hamburg's the closest to Britain, too, so it would be easy to come back for long weekends and holidays. M: That's right, and there's a regular ferry service which would save quite a bit on fares. F: What about the cost of living in Germany as a whole? How does it compare with Britain? M: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. F: And what about accommodation? M: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. F: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? M: In fact, they're quite good in all three. But, of course, Munich has an international reputation as a cultural center. F: Another thing we'll have to consider, of course, are the educational possibilities. How long would you want to go to Germany for? M: I think a maximum of five years.

Summarize: Instead of waiting around until you feel like taking a shower, talk yourself into making the resolution that you're going to do it no matter what, and stick to it. Be your own coach. Give yourself encouraging advice and offer affirmation by making inspiring and affirming statements. You'll start feeling more capable as soon as you shift your attitude from \\"I don't want to\\" to \\"I can do this.\\" Most of the time when people have a hard time making themselves do something, it's because they dread the effort or they're “not in the mood.” Understand that there will always be things you don't feel like doing in life that have to be done nonetheless. Saying your own name can make you feel more empowered by allowing you to step outside of yourself momentarily and creating a sense of personal accountability. Put your pride on the line and start looking at overcoming your reluctance to shower as a way to prove yourself. If you can't even bathe yourself, what else won't you be able to do? It may sound silly, but this is an opportunity for personal growth. Show yourself that you can do what you set your mind to and you'll feel more in control of other areas of your life as a result. Start making a list of daily goals to accomplish and put showering near the top. You'll gain a little more willpower and self-control every time you shower when you don't feel like it. Once you manage to make yourself shower, do it again the next day at the same time, then the next day, then the next and so on. Don't let yourself skip a day or beat around the bush until it's too late. After a week or so, your inertia will start to disappear and showering will become just another part of your normal routine. Set a regular bathing schedule for yourself based on your own needs and preferences. Some people might have to shower everyday, whereas others can get by with only a few showers a week, or even once a week. Pick days and times that will make it easier for you to stick to your schedule. When showering becomes a habit, you'll start to feel like something's missing if you don't take one.","completion":"To overcome the reluctance to shower, change your attitude from \\"I don't want to\\" to \\"I can do this\\" and be your own coach.

When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens...

Returning to one's hometown after years can evoke a mix of nostalgia and excitement. In this scenario, it is natural for the person to express their desire to reconnect with old friends. Meeting old friends provides an opportunity to reminisce about cherished memories and experiences, catch up on each other's lives, and reestablish the bond that may have weakened over time. These meetups can also be a source of emotional support, as friends understand each other's history and can offer valuable advice or empathy. Reuniting with friends from the past allows the person to walk down memory lane and once again feel a sense of belonging to their hometown community. While the other options, like forgiving, making new friends, buying presents for others, and expressing love may also be relevant in certain situations, they are not as resonant or emotionally satisfying as reconnecting with old friends.

It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes.

Answer this question please: Which researcher observed more membranes of two cells merging? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill, who studied prokaryotes, observed more membranes of two cells merging.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

And I was wondering What does Cameron need to do before this? A:","completion":"Before Cameron initiates physical touch with Robin, such as putting a hand on his leg or getting intimate, it's essential to follow these steps to ensure both parties are comfortable: 1. Establish rapport: Ensure that Cameron and Robin have a good connection and communication. This involves getting to know each other better, discussing shared interests, and forming a sense of trust and mutual understanding. 2. Assess comfort levels: Cameron should pay attention to non-verbal cues and body language to gauge Robin's feelings and emotions. This might help Cameron understand if Robin is open to physical affection or touch. 3. Communication: It's essential for Cameron to express their intentions and desire to get intimate and have an open conversation with Robin. This will allow both parties to voice their feelings, boundaries, and comfort levels in terms of physical touch. 4. Obtain consent: Obtaining clear and explicit consent from Robin is crucial before engaging in any form of physical affection. If Robin is not comfortable with Cameron's advance, it's essential to respect their boundaries and feelings. Once these steps are followed, depending on Robin's response and their established boundaries, Cameron may choose an appropriate action from the available options: a). Kiss them, if Robin is comfortable and has given clear consent; b). Keep the interaction at a friendly level with good communication, and avoid physical intimacy if Robin is not comfortable with it; c).

Answer a question about this article: Scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. Body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340). For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.[citation needed] What do lice require human clothing to do?","completion":"Lice require human clothing to survive.

(August 2015) Abby Barnes (Garofalo) is a veterinarian and host of a radio show called The Truth About Cats and Dogs. When she makes a blind date with Brian (Chaplin), a caller to her show, her insecurity about her appearance leads her to persuade her more conventionally attractive (though less intellectual) friend Noelle (Thurman) to pretend to be Abby on their date. Both women develop feelings for Brian, leading to a series of comic misunderstandings. Brian's persistence in pursuing Noelle in person is thwarted as Noelle tries to maneuver him toward the real Abby. After Abby behaves jealously while drunk and embarrasses herself at a photo shoot, she leaves and it appears to her that Brian and Noelle sleep together. However, Noelle actually leaves too, and Brian, distressed by Noelle's changing attitude, corners Abby in her apartment where he finds evidence of her real identity as the radio host he fell for through her voice. As Abby and Noelle attempt to explain, Brian decides he has been the victim of a practical joke and leaves in disgust. Abby later approaches Brian at his regular bar and explains what happened, and although initially dismissive, he eventually meets with Abby and he has fallen for the real Abby and was only attracted to Noelle because of their deception.

Write a title for this article: BY Peter Botte DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Sunday, January 30th 2011, 4:00 AM Jorge PosadaÂ tried to play the good soldier in his first public comments this winter. He said Saturday night that his switch from behind the plate to full-time DH in 2011 \\"is what it is,\\" while also playing the \\"whatever's best for the team\\" card. But the Yankees' longtime backstop also admitted later that he's keeping his mitt broken in \\"just in case,\\" indicating he hasn't fully come to terms with being phased out of the position he's owned since the late '90s. \\"I'll catch. I'll catch. I'll catch this year,\\" Posada said before Bernie Williams' charity dinner for the Hillside Food Outreach in New Rochelle. \\"I'll DH and then they're going to want me to catch one of those days. I'm keeping an open mind. I would love to catch. I'm training like I always do, and if I have to catch, I'll catch.\\" Posada was responding to GM Brian Cashman, who earlier this week said Posada shouldn't expect to be anything more than the Yanks' full-time designated hitter and their \\"emergency catcher\\" in 2011. Cashman met with Posada - who Saturday night claimed his surgically repaired left knee is 100% - in November to inform him of the career change. The Yanks then added former Dodgers backstop Russell Martin to share catching duties with either Francisco Cervelli or rookies Jesus Montero and Austin Romine. \\"I can't complain. I always like to catch, I'm used to catching, but if they want me to DH to help out the team, you have to do that,\\" Posada said. \\"It is what it is. I look forward to everything I do. I try to help out the team, and if that's going to help out the team and that's what they want, I'm OK with it.\\" Posada, 39, also said the transition probably is \\"going to be toughest during the season,\\" especially the mental adjustment to remain involved in the game without playing defensively. \\"When you're a catcher and try to catch, but you can't and you try to DH, it's tough, it's a struggle,\\" Posada said. \\"But going into a season and knowing you're going to be a DH, I have to look for a routine. It's not easy to be a DH. I have to find a nice little routine that I can get used to and have a good season.\\" Still, he also acknowledged that such a move probably means he \\"won't be as beat up\\" from the usual wear and tear of catching duties. After batting just .248 with 18 homers and 57 RBI in 451 plate appearances during an injury-plagued 2010, he is entering the final season of a four-year, 52 million contract. \\"I would like to keep my doors open, I would like if I feel good and feel like I can do it and having fun, I would like to keep going,\\" Posada said. \\"I love playing the game. I just hope that everything stays healthy.\\" The Yankees' handling of Posada is part of an offseason in which they also engaged in contentious contract relations with Derek Jeter while preparing for the possibility that Andy Pettitte might not return for a 17th season. Posada said he's talked and texted often with Pettitte, before adding, \\"I haven't asked him anything about baseball. I just want him to make the decision. ...Whatever it is, honestly, we're going to support it. Andy is a very valuable guy for us. If he wants to be home, obviously he has the reasons to be home, but we need him.\\" Even if Posada and other members of the old guard won't be needed in their accustomed roles forever. \\"We're getting old,\\" Posada joked. \\"It's tough, it's a business. We have to keep performing, keep doing well, so the decisions are tougher.

At 18 she is able to secure a position as governess to a girl at Thornfield Hall. Here Jane learns that her pupil Adele, a French girl, was left in the care of the master of the house, Edward Rochester. She is also informed that the master of the house is seldom at home. On one of his journeys back to Thornfield Hall, Jane at last meets Rochester. One night, Jane wakes to strange noises coming from Rochesterâs room.

Website Offers Background Checks to Candidates in New Jersey, Eyes National Service How can you tell when political candidates are lying about their background? Many voters would say, when their lips are moving. But a new service called CandidateCheck is trying to turn that that sentiment on its head by offering free background checks to all 270 registered candidates running for New Jersey state office this year. The background checks will include searches that date back 10 years on criminal, civil and employment records, examination of military records, verification of diplomas and professional licenses and searches of national sex-offender registries. Candidates authorize the background check and can review and dispute the results of the findings before they are released to the public. \\"What we're offering to candidates is an opportunity to show voters, donors, the parties and other interest groups that they are who they say they are,\\" founder David Doud told FoxNews.com. Doud is test-driving the service in New Jersey, the first state holding legislative primaries this year, in June. He plans to offer the service to other states with primaries coming up: Mississippi (August), Virginia (August) and Louisiana (October). But it's unlikely the service will be free to candidates in those states, Doud said. The service typically costs nearly 300. \\"I'm underwriting New Jersey to launch the business,\\" he said. \\"But I can't underwrite all of the candidates at all levels of government.\\" Candidates who use the service can boast that an impartial third-party source has verified that all their stated accomplishments and credentials are authentic -- a good housekeeping seal of approval for politics. Voters can see a summary report of any candidate who completes the background check on the website. It's a service that Doud says could have benefited Alvin Greene in South Carolina and Tea Party darling Christine O'Donnell in Delaware. Days after the inexperienced and party outsider Greene shocked the political world by winning the Democratic primary for Senate, news broke that he was facing felony obscenity charges. O'Donnell, who won the Republican primary for Senate, had to deal with the fallout over disclosures that a mortgage company had obtained a judgment against here for 90,000 and that the IRS had filed a lien against her for 11,000 in back taxes and penalties. Both were soundly defeated in the general election. Doud hatched the idea to launch the service after his experience as a two-time political candidate in Washington state, where potentially damaging information on his two opponents didn't come to light until the very end of the races. In his 2004 bid for state legislator, his Republican primary opponent, who ran on fiscal issues, had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy – a revelation that didn't emerge until after Doud narrowly lost the race and one that Democrats used to defeat the GOP nominee by a wide margin. In his 2009 race for the port of Seattle, he discovered and revealed that his opponent had a tax lien for taking too much unemployment insurance. But Doud says by then, it was too late. \\"By that time, everyone had made up their minds,\\" he said. \\"And so it didn't make much of a difference. And I looked bad doing it.\\" But those defeats led him to launch CandidateCheck. \\"Those experiences made a big impact on me,\\" he said. \\"We live in the age of information. Why is this not part of the consideration for voters early on when they're not in an October surprise frame-of-mind?\\" But some election observers aren't yet sold on the service. \\"It's a neat idea, especially in primaries,\\" said Bruce Larson, a professor of political science at Gettysburg College and an expert on American politics. He said the traditional low turnouts in primaries might be a result of not enough information on the candidates. But he added, \\"People who do vote in primaries, especially closed primaries, these folks tend to go to information sources that reinforce what they think in the first place. Primary voters don't strike me in a lot of cases as seeking objective information.\\" He also rejected the notion that this service could become the next Carfax, a website that offers detailed vehicle history to prospective buyers. \\"With Carfax, you're dumping your money on the line. But in an election, one informed voter won't have much impact on the collective outcome,\\" he said. \\"I think voters tend to do more research when they're the sole decision maker.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A new service called CandidateCheck wants to help people find out if political candidates are being honest about their background. They offer free background checks for people running for office in New Jersey. This includes checking if they have a criminal record, their work history, and their education. This way, voters can be more confident in their choices when they vote. The founder, David Doud, hopes to expand the service to other states but may not offer it for free in those places."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

History of India The most significant event between the 7th and 11th century was the Tripartite struggle centered on Kannauj that lasted for more than two centuries between the Pala Empire, Rashtrakuta Empire, and Gurjara Pratihara Empire. Southern India was ruled by the Chalukya, Chola, Pallava, Chera, Pandyan, and Western Chalukya Empires. The seventh century also saw the advent of Islam as a political power, though as a fringe, in the western part of the subcontinent, in modern-day Pakistan. The Chola dynasty conquered southern India and successfully invaded parts of Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bengal in the 11th century. The early medieval period Indian mathematics influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world and the Hindu numerals were introduced.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin.

Premise: \\"3Federal Debt Management Actions and Future Challenges (GAO-01-317, February 28, 2001).\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The Challenges are specifically about trying to reduce the debt load.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"3Federal Debt Management Actions and Future Challenges (GAO-01-317, February 28, 2001),\\" it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"The Challenges are specifically about trying to reduce the debt load\\" is true. However, to provide a more comprehensive perspective, it is crucial to delve deeper into the matter. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is responsible for providing non-partisan, objective information to the United States Congress and federal agencies, which includes the monitoring of public debt management. Federal debt, which constitutes both the federal budget deficit and outstanding obligations, is a major concern for the United States government and its citizens. Hence, it is plausible that the \\"future challenges\\" outlined in the report may include efforts to reduce the debt load. However, it is essential to recognize that federal debt management encompasses various other aspects apart from simply reducing the debt load. These could involve addressing structural deficiencies in fiscal policies, monitoring public spending, and exploring fiscal sustainability. Thus, the hypothesis in question may only capture a part of the entire picture when it comes to the challenges of federal debt management. Some other challenges that may be discussed in the GAO report are: 1. Long-term fiscal trends: This refers to the long-standing fiscal imbalances driven by factors such as an aging population, rising healthcare costs, and increasing interest payments on the outstanding debt. Addressing these trends require policy adjustments and systemic reforms to ensure a sustainable fiscal trajectory. 2. Strengthening the economy: A robust and expanding economy can lead to increased tax revenues, which may help in reducing budget deficits and stabilize public debt levels. Challenges include fostering economic growth, supporting innovation, and creating a favorable business environment. 3. Establishing fiscal rules and targets: Setting clear and consistent fiscal rules or guidelines can assist the U.S. government in controlling public spending, limiting debt accumulation, and maintaining fiscal discipline. 4. Transparency and accountability: Ensuring government transparency and accountability in fiscal decision-making can bolster public trust, facilitate informed choices, and help to motivate budget discipline. 5. Balancing competing priorities: The U.S. government must strike a balance between addressing public demands for various services and benefits, while maintaining prudent fiscal management. This involves making difficult decisions about funding priorities and distribution of resources. In conclusion, while the hypothesis \\"The Challenges are specifically about trying to reduce the debt load\\" is indeed relevant, it may not fully encapsulate the numerous difficulties faced in federal debt management. The GAO report likely presents a comprehensive outlook, encompassing various aspects of debt management and providing recommendations to tackle the root causes, long-term consequences, and complexities of the issue at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar.

For children with dyspraxia, signing them up for a sport like taekwondo or soccer, or getting them lessons for activities like swimming and dancing are a good way to set aside some regularly structured time for physical activity. Simple at-home activities like a game of catch or tossing a bean bag can help a child with dyspraxia build their coordination. Set aside 10-15 minutes each day to play coordination-building games with your kid. Not only will this help them with their hand-eye skills, it also give you some extra quality time together. Both children and adults with dyspraxia can have trouble gripping pens and writing clearly. Typing can still pose a challenge, but is often easier than adjusting writing skills.

I have a new situation: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. But I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... What is an answer for this question: Which person observed an increased glacier outflow? Answer:","completion":"Jeb observed an increased glacier outflow during his study of Antarctica. The increased glacier outflow in Antarctica is believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. While studying West Antarctica, Jeb noted that the warming in the region was strongest in winter and spring, but this surface warming had not led to significant melting at the surface and was not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead, the recent increases in glacier outflow were found to be driven by the deep ocean's warm water inflow. Jordan, on the other hand, studied climate change in Australia and did not observe glacier outflow as part of his research."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Question: \\"If you're Jewish, and not following Sephardic practices, what are you?\\" Context: \\"In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is Sephardic, since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or Mizrahi woman who marries into an Orthodox or Haredi Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a Sephardi or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A convert generally follows the practice of the beth din that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside Orthodox Judaism.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"If you are Jewish and not following Sephardic practices, then you are most likely an Ashkenazi Jew or belonging to other Jewish sub-groups such as Mizrahi, Romaniote, or Ethiopian Jews, among others. However, the most common non-Sephardic Jewish identity is Ashkenazi. Let's discuss these terms and how they relate to each other. Ashkenazi Jews are those who descended from the medieval Jewish communities that lived along the Rhine River in Germany and France, as well as in Eastern Europe. Over the centuries, they developed their own unique customs, legal interpretations, and liturgical practices. Today, Ashkenazi Jews are the largest Jewish ethnic group worldwide, comprising around 70-80% of the global Jewish population. In contrast, Sephardic Jews originated from the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages, including Spain and Portugal. Expelled from these countries during the 15th century, they spread across North Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, where they continued to practice their cultural and religious traditions. As mentioned in the context provided, many non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews adopt Sephardic practices and follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities. Mizrahi Jews, on the other hand, are the descendants of ancient Jewish communities that lived in the Middle East, primarily in Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and other parts of the region. Like Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, they too have their distinct customs, religious observances, and cultural practices. Romaniote Jews hail from the Romaniotes, an ancient Jewish population that lived in Greece, particularly the areas of Ioannina, Thebes, and Corfu. While their exact origins remain unclear, they have a unique history and their own customs that set them apart from other Jewish groups. Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) are a Jewish community that has lived in Ethiopia for centuries. They strive to maintain their unique customs, which are different from both Sephardic and Ashkenazi practices. As the context suggests, there has been an increasing integration of Jews worldwide, such as in Israel, North America, and other places, which has led to some blurring between the religious definitions of these respective Jewish communities, primarily outside Orthodox Judaism. Consequently, the cultural and religious practices of Jewish communities may evolve or adopt mixed traditions stemming from different Jewish origins. In summary, if you are Jewish and not following Sephardic practices, it is most likely that you are an Ashkenazi Jew or possibly belonging to other Jewish ethnic groups such as Mizrahi, Romaniote, or Ethiopian Jews. With the ongoing integration and blending of Jewish communities worldwide, it is essential to acknowledge their distinct cultural and religious backgrounds and understand the rich diversity within Judaism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style?, using the article: Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,..., what would be the answer ?

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, if we accept the given premise to be true, then it is indeed possible to conclude that the hypothesis holds true as well. To further explain, let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis into their respective components. Premise: 1. Lord of beasts and king of dance: This part describes Shiva's qualities and roles. As the lord of beasts, he exercises control over the animal kingdom and, as the king of dance, he symbolizes the dynamic aspects of creation, such as energy and movement. 2. Shiva is as passionate as Vishnu is serene: This statement establishes a relationship between Shiva's passion and Vishnu's serenity. Specifically, it claims that the two traits are equal in magnitude or intensity. Hypothesis: 1. Vishnu's level of serenity is equal to Shiva's level of passion: This statement makes a similar claim as the premise, with the subjects' positions reversed. The focus shifts from Shiva to Vishnu, and asserts that the magnitude of Vishnu's serenity is equivalent to Shiva's passion. Now, let's explore the relationship between the premise and hypothesis: The premise states that Shiva's passion is equal to Vishnu's serenity. In the hypothesis, we are provided with the converse of that relationship, expressing that Vishnu's serenity is equal to Shiva's passion. Given their similar claims, if one is true, so is the other. Mathematically, this may be represented as the following equation, where we denote Shiva's passion (SP) and Vishnu's serenity (VS): SP = VS The hypothesis, on the other hand, may be expressed as: VS = SP As both statements represent the same relationship between Shiva's passion and Vishnu's serenity, we can conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis also holds true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is \\"the one who should be fired.\\" Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back.

While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \\"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\\" This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists & bands such as: David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.Like many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, \\"Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.\\" This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as \\"arcane night music\\" in prerelease promotion)..., what would be the answer ?

The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type \\"number\\", are expected to start with \\"How many\\". For instance, \\"How long did an event last?\\" can be phrased as \\"How many years did an event last?\\". To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is. Q: Passage: Municipal and state laws are enforced by the Fort Wayne Police Department, an organization of 460 officers. In 2006, Fort Waynes crime rate was 5104.1 per 100,000 people, slightly above the national average of 4479.3. There were 18 murders, 404 robberies, and 2,128 burglaries in 2006. Steve Reed was appointed to the position of police chief in 2016. In 2014, former police chief Rusty York was appointed to the position of director of public safety. York previously served as police chief from 2000 to 2014. As of 2010, the Fort Wayne Fire Department includes 375 uniformed firefighters and 18 fire stations. Eric Lahey was appointed fire chief in 2014. A:","completion":"1. Question: How many more per 100,000 people was the crime rate above the national average in 2006? Answer: 624.8 Reasoning: To find how much the crime rate in Fort Wayne was above the national average in 2006, you need to subtract the national average (4479.3) from Fort Wayne's crime rate (5104.1). 5104.1 - 4479.3 = 624.8. 2. Question: How many years after Rusty York left the position of police chief was Steve Reed appointed to the position? Answer: 2 years Reasoning: Rusty York served as the police chief from 2000 to 2014, and Steve Reed was appointed police chief in 2016. To find the number of years between their appointments, subtract Rusty York's last year from Steve Reed's appointment year: 2016 - 2014 = 2. 3. Question: How many total law enforcement officers, firefighters, and fire stations were in Fort Wayne as of 2010? Answer: 853 Reasoning: To find the total number of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and fire stations in Fort Wayne, add the number of Fort Wayne police officers (460), firefighters (375), and fire stations (18). 460 + 375 + 18 = 853. 4. Question: How many more police officers are there in Fort Wayne than firefighters and fire stations combined? Answer: 67 Reasoning: To find the difference between the number of police officers and the combined number of firefighters and fire stations in Fort Wayne, subtract the number of firefighters (375) and fire stations (18) from the number of police officers (460): 460 - (375 + 18) = 460 - 393 = 67."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The first question is about identifying the reasons behind a drop in sales, while the second question is about increasing sales for a specific type of retail store in a rural area. However, they are related because understanding the reasons for a drop in sales may help to find solutions to increase sales. First question: How does one identify reasons for a drop in sales for a retail store? Step 1: Gather data Collect sales data for the past few months or years, including total sales, sales by product category, average transaction value, and customer traffic. Step 2: Analyze the data Identify trends, such as a specific time period in which sales started to decline or certain product categories that have lower sales than before. Step 3: Compare with industry trends Check if the drop in sales is specific to the retail store or if the overall industry is experiencing a similar trend. This will help determine if external factors are affecting the business. Step 4: Conduct customer surveys and feedback Gain insights from customers, either through surveys, reviews, or direct conversations. Customers may provide valuable information about their shopping experience and preferences. Step 5: Evaluate internal factors Inspect the store layout, pricing strategy, product offering, inventory management, staff performance, and marketing efforts. These internal factors can significantly influence sales. Step 6: Assess external factors Consider influences outside the store, such as increased competition, changes in customers' preferences, economic conditions, demographic changes, or regulatory impacts. Step 7: Identify specific reasons Based on the analysis, pinpoint the key reasons for the drop in sales and prioritize them. Second question: How can I increase the sales of my mobile retail store which is in a rural area?

Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Hint: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana.

The passage mentions Sun Microsystems, a prominent technology company, and its attempt to move closer to open-source software by submitting a draft license for its Solaris operating system to the Open Source Initiative (OSI). Sun Microsystems has a history of contributing to the open-source community, and this article highlights the company's efforts to create a more open environment for its flagship product, Solaris. The article also highlights the uncertainty within Sun Microsystems over its relationship between Solaris and Linux, which are both operating systems. Linux is already well-established as an open-source operating system, while Solaris had been proprietary but was moving toward open-source. The mention of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) is significant, too, as this organization plays a crucial role in promoting and protecting open-source software. It is responsible for reviewing and approving various open-source licenses, ensuring that they meet the criteria and standards of the open-source community. Once approved, a license allows software creators to indicate that their product can be freely redistributed and modified under specific terms and conditions. The fact that Sun Microsystems submitted a draft license to OSI implies that they were seeking a formal endorsement of their open-source ambitions for Solaris. This move would have a significant impact on the technology industry, as it would allow a broader range of developers and organizations to access and contribute to the development of Solaris as an open-source platform. In conclusion, this article is about the Science/Tech category with a specific focus on open-source software and the relationship between Sun Microsystems, Solaris, and the Open Source Initiative. It highlights the steps Sun Microsystems has taken towards making Solaris an open-source operating system and the tension within the company over its approach to competing operating system Linux."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: \\"Two men fighting while playing frisbee.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"they fight while playing the game\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise, \\"Two men fighting while playing frisbee,\\" does present a situation in which two individuals are engaged in a conflict during a game of frisbee. However, it doesn't provide us with exhaustive information to confirm whether the hypothesis, \\"they fight while playing the game,\\" is entirely accurate. To fully evaluate the hypothesis, we need to dig deeper into the specific aspects of the situation presented in the premise. The hypothesis and the premise seem to correlate on the surface level. Both mention that the two individuals are fighting and also playing frisbee. However, to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, we need to consider various factors and possible scenarios. 1. Motivation behind the fight: The premise doesn't clarify the reason behind the fight. There could be multiple explanations for the disagreement, such as a personal issue unrelated to the game, heated competition between the players, or miscommunication during the game. It is essential to understand why the men are fighting before assessing whether the hypothesis is valid or not. 2. Timeline of events: The premise indicates that the fighting is happening while playing frisbee, but it does not specifically address whether the fighting occurs concurrently with the game. It is possible that the fighting could have started before the game, progressed independently, and continued after the game. For the hypothesis to be true, the fighting should be directly intertwined with the game, not just co-occur with it. 3. Sequential vs. simultaneous events: The premise does not explicitly state that the two men are fighting and playing simultaneously. It is possible that one event happens immediately after the other, i.e., they might be engaged in a heated argument and then decide to play frisbee or vice versa. For the hypothesis to be accurate, both events must occur together. 4. Physicality of the fight: The premise states that the men are \\"fighting,\\" which could be interpreted in various ways. There could be a physical altercation, a verbal argument, or a passive-aggressive dynamic. The hypothesis implies that the fight should be occurring while the game is being played, but it is not clear if this is an aggressive act directly affecting the gameplay or just an intense verbal disagreement. To conclude, based on the premise \\"Two men fighting while playing frisbee,\\" we cannot definitively determine whether the hypothesis \\"they fight while playing the game\\" is true or not. There are several aspects, such as motivation, timeline, sequential vs. simultaneous events, and physicality of the fight, that the premise does not address. While it alludes to a situation where both fighting and playing frisbee are happening, it does not offer enough information to confirm or deny the hypothesis fully."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: It started when a honeybee flew up Michael Smith’s shorts and stung him in the testicles. Smith is a graduate student at Cornell University, who studies the behaviour and evolution of honeybees. In this line of work, stings are a common and inevitable hazard. “If you’re wearing shorts and doing bee work, a bee can get up there easily,” he says. “But I was really surprised that it didn’t hurt as much as I thought it would.” That got him thinking: Where’s the worst place on the body to get stung? Everyone who works with stinging insects has their own answers, but Smith couldn’t find any hard data. Even Justin Schmidt was no help. Schmidt is the famous creator of the Schmidt Sting Pain Index—a scale that measures the painfulness of insect stings using wonderful synaesthetic descriptions that almost read like wine-tasting notes. Wine-tasting notes of agony. According to Schmidt’s index, the sweat bee sting (1 on a scale of 0 to 4) feels like “a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm”. The yellowjacket sting (2) is “hot and smoky, almost irreverent; imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.” And the daddy of stinging insects—the bullet ant (4+)—produces “pure, intense, brilliant pain, like fire-walking over flaming charcoal with a 3-inch rusty nail grinding into your heel.” Schmidt recognised that “pain levels from particular stings do, of course, vary and depend on such features as where the sting occurred (…)”, but he didn’t say how these levels vary by body part. So, Smith decided to find out. His experimental subject: himself. As he writes in his new paper (which, incidentally, is deadpan gold): “Cornell University’s Human Research Protection Program does not have a policy regarding researcher self-experimentation, so this research was not subject to review from their offices. The methods do not conflict with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 1983. The author was the only person stung, was aware of all associated risks therein, gave his consent, and is aware that these results will be made public.” Smith was methodical. He collected bees by grabbing their wings “haphazardly with forceps” and pressing them against the body part of choice. He left the stinger there for a full minute before removing it, and then rated his pain on a scale of 1 to 10. Pain is very hard to measure, but psychological studies have found that numerical scales do a decent job of putting numbers on an inherently subjective experience. He administered five stings a day, always between 9 and 10am, and always starting and ending with “test stings” on his forearm to calibrate the ratings. He kept this up for 38 days, stinging himself three times each on 25 different body parts. “Some locations required the use of a mirror and an erect posture during stinging (e.g., buttocks),” he wrote. If you are chuckling at the image of a man twisting around in front of a mirror to apply an agitated bee to his butt, I assure you that you are not alone. “All the stings induced pain in the author,” Smith writes. The least painful locations were the skull, upper arm, and tip of the middle toe (all averaging 2.3). “Getting stung on the top of the skull was like having an egg smashed on your head. The pain is there, but then it goes away.” The most painful sites were the penis shaft (7.3), upper lip (8.7) and nostril (9.0). “It’s electric and pulsating,” he Smith. “Especially the nose. Your body really reacts. You’re sneezing and wheezing and snot is just dribbling out. Getting stung in the nose is a whole-body experience.” “Erm, but the penis?” I venture. “It’s painful, and there’s definitely no crossing of wires of pleasure and pain down there,” he says. “But if you’re stung in the nose and penis, you’re going to want more stings to the penis over the nose, if you’re forced to choose.” Was there any point in the experiment when he thought: Hey, maybe I shouldn’t sting myself in the nose and/or penis? “By the time I got round to the third round, I thought: I really don’t want to do my nose again,” he says. “I had originally had the eye on the list, but when I talked to [my advisor Tom Seeley], he was concerned that I might go blind. I wanted to keep my eyes.” There are some interesting nuggets here. We might expect that the most painful places to get stung are the sites that have the thinnest skin or that are served by the most sensory neurons. But neither factor cleanly explains the results. For example, palm with its thick skin hurt much more than the thin-skinned arm or skull. And the upper lip hurt much more than the middle finger, even though both are served by similar numbers of neurons. A pain map of the body would probably look very different to a purely sensory one. Now, clearly, these data are very subjective, and they all come from one person. Smith is clear that his anatomy of pain can’t be generalised to everyone else. “If someone else did this, they’d probably have different locations that they felt were worst”, he says, although from talking to his colleagues, he feels that the rough shape of the map would be similar. “I didn’t see a lot of merit in repeating this with more subjects,” he says. Any takers? Reference: Smith. 2014. Honey bee sting pain index by body location. PeerJ. http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.338 ||||| A PhD student has allowed bees to sting him 190 times - to find out which part of the body it hurts the most. Michael Smith, from Cornell University, chose 25 locations around his body to let the bee sting him. Despite subjecting himself to barbs in intimate areas, Mr Smith found that the most painful area was the inside of his nostril. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Drive: \\"When you get stung there your whole body reacts... I would not recommend it.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"A man named Michael Smith was studying honeybees and one day, a bee flew up his shorts and stung him. It didn't hurt as much as he thought, so he wondered where would be the worst place to get stung. Michael decided to find out by stinging himself with bees in different parts of his body. He found out that getting stung on the skull, upper arm, and middle toe didn't hurt much, but the most painful places to get stung were the shaft of the penis, upper lip, and inside the nostril. However, this was just Michael's experience and it might be different for other people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: A body for the following movie plot: March 1983. Los Alamos, New Mexico. A group of police cars, with sirens wailing, escort an ambulance to Los Alamos Memorial Hospital. They are carrying an unidentified 50-year old man with acid burns to the face. He is placed on a respirator because the toxic fumes from the acid have seared his lungs and thus compromised his ability to breathe. A Detective (Elias Koteas) attempts to speak with him, asking him to identify himself and wondering whether he is a part of a Satanic cult. He gets no reply. A nurse calls him to the front desk to take a telephone call from the receptionist in the lobby who reports that the man's daughter is asking about him. Hearing a sudden change in the beeping of his respirator, the nurse returns to the man's room and screams. The man has jumped out of his tenth floor window to his death, leaving only a note that reads: \\"I'm sory [sic] Abby\\".Two weeks earlier. Twelve-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is sitting alone in the snow-covered courtyard of his apartment building, singing to himself, until his mother (Cara Buono) calls him for dinner. Owen's parents are in the process of a nasty divorce, and Owen is often left to eat alone and amuse himself by playing alone in his room. One evening, he notices a girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) about his age and her father (Richard Jenkins) moving into the apartment next door to his. Oddly, she is wearing no shoes.The next day at school, Owen is picked on as usual by three older boys -- Kenny (Dylan Minnette) and his friends Mark (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak) and Donald (Nicolai Dorian). Out of fear, wimpy Owen doesn't fight back, even though they give him a wedgie, causing him to urinate on himself. That evening, as he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors, he notices the new girl, Abby, watching him. She's not very friendly and tells him right off that they can't be friends. Not long afterwards, her father walks through the courtyard. It is revealed to the viewers, and what Owen doesn't know, is that he is not Abby's...

Please answer the following question: Information: - Bari dialect (\\"dialetto barese\\") is a dialect of Neapolitan spoken in the Apulia and Basilicata regions of Italy. Influences range from Old French due to Norman and Angevin rule, to an ancient pre-Roman Illyrian substratum, creating one of the most distinct Italian dialects both from phonetics and lexis point of view. - Normandy (pronounced , Norman: \\"Normaundie\\", from Old French \\"Normanz\\", plural of \\"Normant\\", originally from the word for \\"northman\\" in several Scandinavian languages) is one of the regions of France, roughly corresponding to the historical Duchy of Normandy. - Saint Nicholas; (15 March 270 6 December 343), also called Nikolaos of Myra, was a historic 4th-century Christian saint and Greek Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor (modern-day Demre, Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nikolaos the Wonderworker. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the traditional model of Santa Claus through Sinterklaas. - The Battle of Cerignola was fought on April 28 , 1503 , between Spanish and French armies , in Cerignola , near Bari in Southern Italy . Spanish forces , under Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba , formed by 6,300 men , including 2,000 landsknechte , with more than 1,000 arquebusiers , and 20 cannons , defeated the French who had 9,000 men ; mainly heavy gendarme cavalry and Swiss mercenary pikemen , with about 40 cannons , and led by Louis d'Armagnac , Duke of Nemours , who was killed . - Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours (1472, Normandy; April 28, 1503, Cerignola, Italy), known for most of his life as the Count of Guise, was the third son of Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours and Louise of Anjou. - Apulia ( Apoulia) is a region of Italy in Southern Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea in the east, the Ionian Sea to the southeast, and the Strait of Òtranto and Gulf of Taranto in the south. Its southernmost portion, known as the Salento peninsula, forms a \\"stiletto\\" on the \\"boot\\" of Italy. The region comprises , and its population is about 4 million. - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards. - The (plural: \\"\\") is a basic administrative division in Italy, roughly equivalent to a township or municipality. - Foggia is a city and \\"comune\\" of Apulia, in southern Italy, capital of the province of Foggia.

It generally coincides with the administrative regions of Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Molise, Sicily, and Sardinia. Some also include the most southern and eastern parts of Lazio (Sora, Cassino, Gaeta, Cittaducale and Amatrice districts) within the \\"Mezzogiorno\\", because these territories were also part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The island of Sardinia, although for cultural and historical reasons having less in common with the aforementioned regions, is frequently included as Southern Italy or \\"Mezzogiorno\\", often for statistical and economical purposes. - The Italian Wars, often referred to as the Great Italian Wars or the Great Wars of Italy and sometimes as the HabsburgValois Wars or the Renaissance Wars, were a series of conflicts from 1494 to 1559 that involved, at various times, most of the city-states of Italy, the Papal States, the Republic of Venice, most of the major states of Western Europe (France, Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, England, and Scotland) as well as the Ottoman Empire. Originally arising from dynastic disputes over the Duchy of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples, the wars rapidly became a general struggle for power and territory among their various participants, and were marked with an increasing number of alliances, counter-alliances, and betrayals. - Cerignola is a town and \\"comune\\" of Apulia, Italy, in the province of Foggia, southeast from the town of Foggia. It has the third-largest land area of any \\"comune\\" in Italy, at , after Rome and Ravenna. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ; meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320. Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million. About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Andria is a city and \\"comune\\" in Apulia (southern Italy). It is an agricultural and service center, producing wine, olives and almonds. It is the fourth-largest municipality in the Apulia region (behind Bari, Taranto, and Foggia) and the largest municipality of the new Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani, effective as of June 2009. It is known for the 13th-century Castel del Monte. - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Granada is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the Beiro, the Darro, the Genil and the Monachil.

Nearby is the Sierra Nevada Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were held. - Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, or simply Gonzalo de Córdoba (1 September 1453 2 December 1515), Duke of Terranova and Santangelo, Andria, Montalto and Sessa, was a Spanish general who fought in the Conquest of Granada and the Italian Wars. He reorganized the emerging Spanish army and its tactics, and was regarded as the \\"father of trench warfare\\". He was also called \\"The Great Captain\\". Many influential men fought under him (including Francisco Pizarro's father), and he was admired by the generation of conquistadors which followed. - In the 12th and 13th centuries the Lordship of Nemours, in the Gatinais, France, was a possession of the house of Villebéon, a member of which, Gautier, was marshal of France in the middle of the 13th century.

The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Dan Bailey gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. The Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). On the Broncos' next possession, Manning threw his first interception of the season, and the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater, however, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter.

The premise and the hypothesis are simply two different ways of expressing the same idea. The premise states that Julius spoke first and questioned whether the other person did not send the item in question, using the phrase \\"You didn't send it?\\" The hypothesis rephrases Julius's question, using the word \\"dispatch\\" instead of \\"send,\\" and presents it as \\"You didn't dispatch it?\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis convey that Julius is unsure whether the other person has sent or dispatched the item being discussed. If we assume the premise is true, meaning that Julius indeed asked if the item was not sent, then the hypothesis merely reiterates this idea using a synonym for \\"send.\\" Therefore, if the premise is true, we can conclude that the hypothesis is also true since they convey the same information with slightly different wording."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: Who Moved My Cheese Synopsis?

Premise: \\"Hitler's death by his own hand cannot be counted as one of history's accidents.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hilter to kill himself.\\" true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hitler to kill himself,\\" I will analyze the premise and break down the contributing factors that led to Hitler's suicide. Step 1: Understand the premise The given premise states that Hitler's death by his own hand cannot be counted as one of history's accidents. This suggests that there were significant factors and events that caused Hitler to commit suicide, rather than it being a random or accidental occurrence. Step 2: Identify key events in Hitler's life To assess the hypothesis, it's essential to consider the various events and circumstances in Hitler's life that might have contributed to his decision to take his own life. Some crucial factors include: - Hitler's rise to power and the establishment of the Nazi regime - The implementation of the Holocaust and the pursuit of a genocidal agenda - The outbreak and progression of World War II - The gradual erosion of support within the Nazi leadership and the German population - The military setbacks suffered by Nazi Germany, particularly on the Eastern front - The invasion of Nazi Germany by the Allied forces - Hitler's deteriorating health issues and mental state Step 3: Analyze the impact of these events on Hitler's mindset Each of the events listed in step 2 contributed in different ways to the mounting pressures on Hitler, leading him to feel trapped and increasingly hopeless. As the tides of WW2 began to turn against him, and faced with the prospect of defeat and capture, Hitler may have seen suicide as the only way to retain control of his fate and escape the potential humiliation of facing trial or assassination. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis Based on the analysis above, the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hitler to kill himself\\" appears to be supported. Numerous factors contributed to Hitler's mindset and decision to commit suicide, indicating that his death cannot be considered an accident, but rather the culmination of multiple events and pressures throughout his life. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Lots of events led Hitler to kill himself\\" is true, as it is supported by the premise \\"Hitler's death by his own hand cannot be counted as one of history's accidents\\" and various key events in Hitler's life that greatly impacted his mindset and ultimately pushed him to commit suicide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Q: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Might awaken Dreams of falling are common and can be experienced by many individuals. When John hits the ground in his dream, he might awaken due to the sensations, emotions, or triggers associated with the falling event in his dream. During sleep, our brain experiences various cycles and stages, ranging from light sleep to a deep sleep known as REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Dreams typically occur during the REM sleep stage, during which our body experiences a natural paralysis called “atonia” to prevent us from acting out our dreams and causing potential harm to ourselves or our surroundings. Dreams of falling can bring about a variety of physical sensations and emotional responses, such as an increase in heart rate, a jolt of adrenaline, or a feeling of fear. These natural bodily responses can rouse us from sleep, causing us to awaken abruptly. This phenomenon, known as a hypnagogic jerk or sleep start, can be alarming to some individuals, leading to feelings of panic or disorientation upon waking. However, these sensations are generally harmless and subside quickly as the individual regains full consciousness. Out of the given options, sleepwalking (A) is not relevant to John hitting the ground in his dream, as it is a separate sleep disorder generally occurring during non-REM sleep. Dying a terrible death (B) is not a possibility, as dreams cannot cause physical harm. Confusion (C) and fear (D) are possible emotional responses to waking from such a dream.

Background: Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Abhoy Charonarobindo Bhoktibedanto Shwamy Probhupad; 1 September 1896 - 14 November 1977) was a Gaudiya Vaishnavism spiritual teacher (guru) and the founder preceptor (Acharya) of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the \\"Hare Krishna Movement\\". Adherents of the ISKCON movement view Prabhupada as a divine avatar and messenger of Krishna. Born Abhay Charan De in Calcutta, he was educated at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta. Before adopting the life of a pious renunciant (vanaprastha) in 1950, he was married with children and owned a small pharmaceutical business. Context: Born on 1 September 1896, the day after Janmastami ,one of the most important Vaishnava holidays, in a humble house in the Tollygunge suburb of Calcutta in a Bengali Suvarna Banik family, he was named Abhay Charan, \\"one who is fearless, having taken shelter at Lord Krishna's feet.\\" Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava (\\"the celebration of Nanda,\\" Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honour of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulal. His parents, Sriman Gour Mohan De and Srimati Rajani De, were devout Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu). In accordance with Bengali tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the delivery, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home at 6 Sitakanta Banerjee Lane Kolkata 700005 He received a European-led education in the Scottish Church College, which was well reputed among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral men, and it is believed that the students received a good education. The college was located in north Calcutta, near the De's family home on Harrison Road. During his years in the college, Abhay Charan De (abhy' crnn de) was a member of the English Society as well as that of the Sanskrit Society, and it has been suggested that his education provided him a foundation for his future leadership. He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics. He rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement. At 22 years of age he married Radharani Devi, who was then 11 years old, in a marriage arranged by their parents. At 14, she gave birth to Abhay's first son.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What part of the discrete inheritable units can be observed?\\" Context: \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The part of the discrete inheritable units that can be observed is the phenotype of an organism. In the context provided, Gregor Mendel studied inheritance patterns in pea plants and discovered that these discrete inherited units, which are now known as genes, give rise to observable physical characteristics. These observable physical characteristics are called phenotypes, which are the visible traits of an organism that result from the expression of its genetic material, or genotype. Mendel's experiments allowed him to identify several key principles of genetics, including independent assortment, dominant and recessive traits, and the distinction between heterozygotes and homozygotes, all of which contribute to the phenotypes visible in offspring."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vic agency denied extra time to pay fine A real estate agency fined in Victoria's largest underquoting penalty has been refused an extension of time to pay, with the Federal Court saying a strong message needs to be sent to the industry. The Hocking Stuart Richmond office was found to have manipulated 11 house price estimates in the sought after areas of Richmond and Kew between January 2014 and June 2015. In October, the Federal Court ordered that the branch pay a 330,000 penalty plus 80,000 in costs, in instalments, and gave it two years to pay. However the agency asked the court for an extra year and one month on top of that, saying it was in a precarious financial position. The franchise argued the two-year deadline to pay the penalty was beyond its means and would render the business insolvent. But Federal Court Judge John Middleton on Friday ruled the request \\"excessively long\\". He said the 30 December 2018 deadline sought by Consumer Affairs Victoria - which brought the action - seemed reasonable and should stand. Judge Middleton said extending the time frame would diminish the impact of the penalty, which had to deter others in the real estate industry from similar behaviour. \\"The court must not overlook the seriousness of the contravention,\\" he said. Underquoting is a significant problem for Victorian home buyers, the state regulator has warned. The Federal Court earlier found Hocking Stuart Richmond intended to deceive home buyers with the illusion of a bargain and drive up its profits. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A real estate agency in Victoria, Australia, has been denied extra time to pay a fine imposed for underquoting. The Hocking Stuart Richmond office was given a two-year deadline to pay a 330,000 penalty and 80,000 in costs for manipulating house price estimates. The agency requested an additional year and one month, claiming the deadline would make it insolvent. However, Federal Court Judge John Middleton ruled the request “excessively long” and upheld the original deadline, asserting that extending the time period would lessen the deterrent effect of the penalty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(a). given them his corn in order to save them from hunger (b). saved their village from being drowned by the wave (c). given them many things during his life (d). given his life in order to save theirs Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Shundagarh is a village on India's east-facing coast. It is a village of simple mud and grass houses built on the beach just above the waterline. The Khadra Hills rise immediately behind the village, to a height of one hundred and fifty meters. A simple, good-hearted old man, whose name was Jalpur, farmed two small fields on the very edge of these hills. From his fields he could see the fishing boats that traveled up and down the coast. He could see the children playing on the sands; their mothers washing clothes on the flat stones where the Shiva River flowed into the sea; and their fathers landing the latest catch or repairing nets and telling stories that had no end. All Jalpur owned in the world were the clothes he wore day in and day out, the miserable hut that he slept in at night, a few tools and cooking pots - and his fields. The corn that he grew was all that made life possible. If the weather was kind and the harvest was good, Jalpur could live happily enough - not well, but happily. When the sun was fierce, and there was little or no rain, then he came close to the line between life and death. Last year the weather had been so kind, and the harvest promised to be so good, that Jalpur had been wondering whether he could sell all that he had and live with his son farther up the coast. He had been thinking about doing this for some years. It was his dearest wish to spend his last days with his son and his wife. But he would go only if he could give; he would not go if it meant taking food out of the mouths of his grandchildren. He would rather die hungry than do this. On the day when Jalpur decided that he would harvest his corn, sell it, and move up the coast, he looked out to the sea and saw a huge wave, several kilometers out, advancing on the coast and on the village of Shundagarh. Within ten minutes everyone in Shundagarh would be drowned. Jalpur would have shouted, but the people were too far away to hear. He would have run down the hill, but he was too old to run. He was prepared to do... Question: The villagers were thankful to Jalpur because he had _ .

This included the subject (Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri), the verb (arrived), the time indicator (on Monday), the date in parenthesis (October 4th), the purpose of the event (for an official visit), and the location (to Bulgaria). Then, I proceeded with the translation, bearing in mind the nuances of Turkish grammar which, among others, include subject-object-verb sentence structure and compound noun constructs. I translated each part of the sentence as follows: - \\"Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri\\" to \\"Gürcistan Başbakanı Nika Gilauri\\". - \\"arrived\\" to \\"geldi\\". - \\"on Monday\\" to \\"Pazartesi günü\\". - \\"(October 4th)\\" to \\"(4 Ekim)\\". - \\"for an official visit\\" to \\"resmi bir ziyaret için\\". - \\"to Bulgaria\\" to \\"Bulgaristan'a\\". Finally, I took the translated parts and assembled them in a way that makes sense in Turkish, thus arriving at the translated sentence, \\"Gürcistan Başbakanı Nika Gilauri, Pazartesi günü (4 Ekim) resmi bir ziyaret için Bulgaristan'a geldi,\\" retaining the meaning of the original sentence in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. I am facing a new situation today: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is causing less marine pollution? A:","completion":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article and the given situation, Luke is causing less marine pollution. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Marine pollution is caused by the entry of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles into the ocean. 2. One of the major sources of marine pollution is agriculture fertilizer chemicals and human waste dumped into rivers. 3. The Malegese Ocean is connected to one river near Hilda's farm, and she dumps excess fertilizer into the river. This likely contributes to pollution in the Malegese Ocean since the chemicals from the fertilizer end up in the ocean. 4. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to rivers primarily in uninhabited and natural areas with minimal human impact. Luke has a farm near the Dundrin Ocean but does not dump any excess fertilizer, garbage, or other waste in the rivers or ocean. 5. Since Luke stores excess fertilizer for future use and properly disposes of waste, he is not contributing to marine pollution in the Dundrin Ocean. Therefore, Luke is causing less marine pollution compared to Hilda."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge.

This week we have a seven-story London mansion fit for royalty, Jeff Bridge’s former Montecito estate and \\"Sex & the City\\" author Candace Bushnell's Connecticut country house. It doesn’t get much more posh than this seven-story 7,761-square-foot mansion on Chester Square in one of London’s most desirable neighborhoods. The home has eight bedrooms, two of which occupy an entire floor each. There are seven bathrooms, a drawing room with a balcony overlooking the garden square, a roof terrace and a stunning wine cellar. A mews house, a small cottage that once kept horses, sits behind the main property and is now linked to the house on three floors, greatly increasing the living space. The mews contains entertaining space, a cinema room and a family room. The lower ground floor contains a yoga studio and treatment room. The property has been fully updated with a state of the art lighting control system, an elevator and underfloor heating. You’ll be in good company. Chester Square’s past occupants range from the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Rolling Stone Mick Jagger. Across the pond, Jeff Bridges has just slashed the price on his stunning Montecito estate. The “Big Lebowski” star originally listed this Tuscan-style beauty for 29.5 million. The actor and his wife Susan are looking to downsize and have reduced the price to just 18.5 million. The 9,500-square-foot, five-bedroom main house boasts sweeping mountain and ocean views. The Dude’s property also contains a music recording studio, a small vineyard, a one-bedroom guest cottage, a two-bedroom caretaker’s cottage and a swimming pools. Bridges first bought the properly in 1994 from singer Kenny Loggins and have used it as their main home ever since. And finally, we have the adorable Connecticut Victorian owned by Sex & the City writer Candace Bushnell. The three-bedroom, 1,429-square foot home comes with its very own apple orchard. The grounds are also home to a saltwater pool, a well-manicured rose garden and three acres that can be used for cross-country skiing. Even though the 126-year old main house has been restored it still maintains plenty of charming details, like wood plank floors, a stone fire place and a tin kitchen ceiling.

Who wrote the plays 'Habeus Corpus' and 'Forty Years On'?","completion":"Alan Bennett, an English playwright, screenwriter, actor, and author, wrote the plays 'Habeus Corpus' and 'Forty Years On'. He was born on May 9, 1934, in Armley, Leeds, England. Bennett is widely known for his wit and humor while capturing the essential features of English life and culture in his works. 'Habeus Corpus,' written in 1973, is a comedy play that leans heavily on the traditional British farce with elements of satire. Set in the Brighton residence of Dr. Wicksteed, the plot revolves around a gallery of eccentric characters, infused by their carnal desires and the seemingly perverse aspects of human nature. The title itself, 'Habeus Corpus,' is a Latin phrase meaning \\"you shall have the body,\\" which is a legal term that protects individual liberties. However, in this play, Bennett humorously plays with the phrase to refer to the physical body and its related desires. 'Forty Years On,' written in 1968, is Alan Bennett's first West End play. It is set in a fictional English public school called Albion House, where the Headmaster is about to retire. The play-within-a-play format sees the students and faculty members perform a series of vignettes and musical numbers to take the audience on a journey through the social and cultural changes that occurred in England during the first half of the 20th century. The narrative combines humor with historical events and takes a reflective attitude towards the nation's past, offering an insightful satire on British society. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Alan Bennett has authored numerous other plays, including 'The Madness of George III,' 'The Lady in the Van,' 'The History Boys,' and television monologue series 'Talking Heads.' He has won several prestigious awards for his works, cementing his reputation as one of the most talented and beloved figures in modern British literature and entertainment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life. The film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it. The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny. Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again.

Information: - John Albert Vasa ( Jan Albert Waza ) ( 25 June 1612 -- 29 December 1634 ) was a Polish cardinal , and a Prince - Bishop of Warmia and Kraków . He was the son of Swedish and Polish King Sigismund III Vasa and Austrian archduchess Constance of Austria . - John III (20 December 1537 17 November 1592) was King of Sweden from 1568 until his death. He was the son of King Gustav I of Sweden and his second wife Margaret Leijonhufvud. He was also, quite autonomously, the ruler of Finland, as \\"Duke John\\" from 1556 to 1563. In 1581 he assumed also the title Grand Prince of Finland. He attained the Swedish throne after a rebellion against his brother Eric XIV. He is mainly remembered for his attempts to close the gap between the newly established Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Catholic church. - Sigismund III Vasa (also known as \\"Sigismund III of Poland\\", , , , English exonym: \\"Sigmund\\"; 20 June 1566 30 April 1632 ) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, monarch of the united PolishLithuanian Commonwealth from 1587 to 1632, and King of Sweden (where he is known simply as \\"Sigismund\\") from 1592 as a composite monarchy until he was deposed in 1599. He was the son of King John III of Sweden and his first wife, Catherine Jagellonica of Poland. - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity. - A Prince-Abbot is a title for a cleric who is a Prince of the Church (like a Prince-Bishop), in the sense of an \\"ex officio\\" temporal lord of a feudal entity, notably a State of the Holy Roman Empire. The secular territory ruled by the head of an abbey is known as Prince-Abbacy or Abbey-principality. The holder, however, does not hold the ecclesiastical office of a Bishop. - In Christianity, an archbishop (via Latin \\"archiepiscopus\\", from Greek , from -, \\"chief\\", and , \\"bishop\\") is a bishop of higher rank or office. In some cases, like the Lutheran Church of Sweden, it is the denomination leader title. Like popes, patriarchs, metropolitans, cardinal bishops, diocesan bishops, and suffragan bishops, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional orders of bishops, priests, also called presbyters, and deacons. An archbishop may be granted the title, or ordained as chief pastor of a metropolitan see or another episcopal see to which the title of archbishop is attached. - A prince-bishop is a bishop who is also the civil ruler of some secular principality and sovereignty. Thus the principality or prince-bishopric ruled politically by a prince-bishop could wholly or largely overlap with his diocesan jurisdiction, since some parts of his diocese, even the city of his residence, could be exempt from his civil rule, obtaining the status of free imperial city. If the episcopal see is an archbishopric, the correct term is prince-archbishop; the equivalent in the regular (monastic) clergy is prince-abbot. A prince-bishop is usually considered an elected monarch.

Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Noise Records is a German heavy metal record label founded in 1983 by German music industry personality Karl-Ulrich Walterbach as an expansion of his company Modern Music Records. Noise Records specialized in thrash and melodic speed metal. It was sold to the Sanctuary Records Group in 2001 and ceased any activity in 2007 due to the bankruptcy of Sanctuary.

Answer the following question: Experts have put forward detailed plans for a tunnel to join Taiwan with the Chinese mainland. The shortest proposed route would be 126 kilometers--more than twice the length of the English Channel Tunnel.And the longest proposed route would be 207 kilometers. A recent conference in xiamen,Fujian Province brought together more than 70 experts.The event was cosponsored by universities from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.Fujian is the province where both proposed mutes would begin. There is no direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air or sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later,although there is a lack of government funding .There are no technical problems t0 build a Taiwan tunnel.But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits. A professor of TsinghHa University said,\\"A special feature of huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the period of construction.\\" For example,he said,the English channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries.And preparations for the huge Three Corges dam on the Yangze River began in the 1950s. The xiamen conference focused on the longest southern route,which would use the Taiwan-controlled islands of Jinmen and Penghu as steppingstones. The first stage of the new project could be a bridge to cross the five kilometers between Xiamen and Jinmen.This would mean that traveling from Xiamen to Jinmen by car would only take five minutes. The longest tunnel now being planned anywhere in the world is the 54-kilometer land tunnel to link Lyon in France with Turin in Italy.The tunnel will not be completed until 2015-2020.

We have 0*r - 3*r = 12, and we need to find the value of r. First, you see there's a 0*r. Anything multiplied by 0 is always 0. So, 0*r is the same as 0. Now our equation looks like this: 0 - 3*r = 12 Since there's nothing left to subtract from 0 (0 minus something is just negative that something), our equation becomes: -3*r = 12 Now, we need to find what r is. To do that, we need to get rid of the -3 in front of the r. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -3. Here's how it looks: -3*r / -3 = 12 / -3 Since -3 divided by -3 equals 1, we are left with: r = -4 There you go! We've found that r equals -4.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the partial collection that the government received from Steamtown that is still on display in Scranton? , can you please find it? Steamtown, U.S.A., was a steam locomotive museum that ran steam excursions out of North Walpole, New Hampshire, and Bellows Falls, Vermont, from the 1960s to 1983. The museum was founded by millionaire seafood industrialist F. Nelson Blount. The non-profit Steamtown Foundation took over operations following his death in 1967. Because of Vermont's air quality regulations restricting steam excursions, declining visitor attendance, and disputes over the use of track, some pieces of the collection were relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the mid-1980s and the rest were auctioned off. After the move, Steamtown continued to operate in Scranton but failed to attract the expected 200,000–400,000 visitors. Within two years the tourist attraction was facing bankruptcy, and more pieces of the collection were sold to pay off debt. In 1986, the United States House of Representatives, under the urging of Pennsylvania Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. As a result, the National Park Service (NPS) conducted historical research on the equipment that remained in the Foundation's possession. This research was used as a Scope of Collections Statement for the Steamtown National Historic Site. The scope was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. The report provided concise histories of each piece of equipment and made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the soon-to-be government-funded collection. By 1995, Steamtown had been acquired and developed by the NPS with a 66 million allocation. Several more pieces have been removed from the collection as a result of the government acquisition. Part of the Blount collection is still on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton.

The destroyed floodgates would affect the ability of the dam to control the release of water, thus potentially leading to uncontrolled floodwater overflow and significantly increasing the risk of flooding downstream. This directly impacts the safety of the area, as the dam's primary purpose of preventing flood damage would be severely compromised."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Coming off their last-second home loss to Chicago, the Eagles ground out a 23-16 victory on the road against a Minnesota Vikings team coached by former Andy Reid protege Brad Childress. Rookie phenom Adrian Peterson and quarterback Kelly Holcomb, who spent the offseason on the Eagles' roster, took the Vikings down the field for the game's first score - a nine-yard touchdown pass to Visanthe Shiancoe. A 50-yard reception by Greg Lewis down the field set up David Akers' first field goal, then Donovan McNabb guided the Eagles to a touchdown drive early in the second quarter, with Brian Westbrook the recipient of a short six-yard scoring pass. Westbrook carried it up the middle from the one-yard line on Philadelphia's next drive to make it 17-7. Ryan Longwell booted a 39-yard field goal for Minnesota to draw the score to 17-10 later in the second quarter. Akers and Longwell traded field goals in the third quarter to make it 20-13. A 48-yarder by Longwell in the final quarter drew the Vikings to within four points, but they would get no closer, while Akers added his third field goal to restore the seven-point lead. McNabb's 333 passing yards were his most since the Detroit game, while Reggie Brown topped 100 yards for the first time all season. Westbrook had 92 all-purpose yards and a touchdown on the ground and in the air. Trent Cole recorded two sacks.

Summarize the following: Miscarrying is an incredibly emotional experience. It's normal to feel a sense of loss and you need to allow yourself time to grieve the baby. The emotions you experienced after a miscarriage are normal and may be quite intense. Many women feel sadness or anger. Some unfairly blame themselves or those around them. Allow yourself to experience emotions, even negative ones. Journaling your thoughts during the weeks following your miscarriage can be a healthy way to process your feelings. Remember, hormones play a role as well. The hormonal response you have to pregnancy and miscarriage increase the intensity of your emotions. It's not uncommon to cry for prolonged periods in the wake of a miscarriage. Trouble eating and sleeping are also common after losing a baby. While the emotions may be difficult to deal with, you need to allow yourself to experience them fully. Try to remind yourself these feelings are temporary and, with time, you'll feel closer to normal. Having a strong support network is very important after a miscarriage. Seek out guidance, comfort, and advice from those around you, especially people who've undergone a similar ordeal. Nurses at hospitals see a lot of miscarriages. Talk to the nurse who worked with you and see if she knows any support groups in the area. It can be hard to make others understand a miscarriage. Many women find it helpful to talk to people who've undergone the same experience. Try to explain to your loved ones how you are feeling and what you need from them. Some people need a lot of extra support after a miscarriage while others might crave space. There is no wrong way to feel after suffering pregnancy loss. There are many resources online that address pregnancy loss and some include forums where you can share your thoughts with others. Sites like angelfire.com, mend.org, and aplacetoremember.com are good sites to go to in the weeks after your miscarriage. Join a support group to meet other women and families who have experienced miscarriage. You can find a local group at http://nationalshare.org. Many people will say the wrong thing to you after a miscarriage. For the most part, people are not trying to be hurtful but they may be at a loss as to what to say. When trying to help, your loved ones may end up saying the wrong thing. Many people will make comments trying to help you feel better. They may say something like, \\"At least you weren't very far along\\" or \\"You can try again.\\" If you have other children, they might advise you to take comfort in them. They fail to realize such comments negate the loss you're suffering. Try to cope with these comments without getting angry. Simply say something like, \\"I know you are trying to help, and I appreciate that, but those kinds of comments aren't helpful right now.\\" The vast majority of people do not mean to offend and will genuinely want to know if they're saying anything upsetting to you. It takes time to recover from a miscarriage. However, if it's been more than a few months and you're still feeling off you may need psychiatric help. A miscarriage can be traumatic. The assistance of a professional therapist or counselor can help you manage your grief. You can find a therapist by calling your insurance provider and asking what doctors in your area are covered by your program. You can also ask for a referral from your general practitioner of OB/GYN. If cost is an issue, many therapist and psychiatrist offer sliding scales. There are also low cost clinics in most big cities that offer free or discounted counseling. Summary:","completion":"Miscarrying is an emotionally intense experience, and it is essential to give yourself time to grieve and process your emotions. Journaling and seeking support from loved ones or support groups can be helpful during this time. Hormonal changes can intensify your emotions, making it difficult to eat, sleep, and control your feelings. It is crucial to communicate your needs to those around you and be patient with others' attempts to comfort you. If your emotions do not improve after a few months, you may want to consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the EP released in 2008 by the duo who returned to the band in 2007? On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year.

Let's break down the premise into its constituent parts: 1. There was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room: This part establishes the presence of a table with a lamp on it, and that it is situated in the center of the room. 2. Sitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough: This part tells us that Whittington was indeed sitting at the table, facing the narrator. Now let's examine the hypothesis: \\"In the middle of the room, Whittington was sitting at the table.\\" The hypothesis states two essential components: 1. In the middle of the room: This part coincides with the information given in the premise that the table with the lamp is in the middle of the room. 2. Whittington was sitting at the table: This part is also supported by the given premise, which explicitly states that Whittington was sitting at the table facing the narrator.

Their mother, publishing heiress Anne Scripps, welcomes them in her New York mansion. Anne has recently divorced her husband Tony, and is still struggling with the divorce. Nonetheless, she is happy with her new boyfriend, much younger Scott Douglas, a volatile-tempered young man whom she marries only months after their first meeting. From the start, Alex is uncertain if she should trust Scott, having heard stories about a possible violent past. When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news. To get rid of her, he claims that he has found marijuana in Alex's bedroom. Alex denies the accusation, but Anne defends her boyfriend, who forces Alex to leave the house. Shortly after Anne and Scott's baby, Tori's, birth in June 1990, Scott gets violent and beats up Anne for inviting Tony's family for the baby's coming out party. Alex and Annie encourage their mom to leave Scott, but Anne forgives him after a couple of months. By June 1991, she and Scott are a happy couple again. On Alex's 21st birthday, Scott lashes out at Anne again when he finds her smoking in the same room as Tori, and then throws a guest, Stacey, off the stairs. Enraged, Alex dares Scott to hit her, and the police interrupts their fight, only to have Scott lie about the situation. A similar occurrence takes place at a formal ball, where Scott pushes around Anne in front of her friends.

Let me explain it to you like you're a five-year-old. A classifieds portal is like a big online board where people can post things they want to sell, buy or rent and others can find them easily. Quikr and OLX are examples of such websites. For the first question about online tools: Imagine making a website is like building a house of toy blocks. You need special blocks to make it look good and work well, right? There are some easy-to-use tools that can help you build your website even if you don't know how to design it. Some popular tools are Wix, Weebly, and Shopify. They give you pre-made blocks (called templates) to choose from, and you can arrange them to make your website. For the second question about how to start such a portal: Think of it as a recipe - you know what you want to cook (a classifieds portal) but you need step-by-step instructions. Here's a simple guide: 1. Choose a name for your website. 2. Use an online tool like the ones I mentioned earlier. 3. Pick a nice template that looks like Quikr or OLX. 4.

Write a negative yelp review (OPT: [-] negative [-] positive).","completion":"Review Title: Far from Expectations Score: ★☆☆☆☆ I usually am not one who complains or writes negative reviews, but occasionally you experience something so disappointing that you feel the need to express your dissatisfaction. My recent visit to this establishment was one of those experiences. Upon entering, the atmosphere was dreary, rather seeming like an oasis of comfort as it appears in various glossy photos, promising an inviting ambiance. The much-advertised \\"stylish and cozy atmosphere\\" appeared to be non-existent due in large part to the dim lighting that felt more like a poorly maintained haunted house rather than a trendy cafe. It lacked the warmth and friendliness that would make one want to return for a second cup of coffee or a decent dinner. The service was lackluster. I understand that on busy nights, things can get a bit hectic, but the waitstaff seemed uninterested and barely responsive. We waited for an unreasonable amount of time before someone came over to take our order, a total of 35 minutes. Throughout the evening, the waiting staff could be seen clustered in corners, chatting and laughing amongst themselves, seemingly oblivious to the array of patrons awaiting their attention. To top it off, when our orders were finally taken, they were delivered incorrectly. Speaking of the food, it was far from satisfying. The ingredients did not taste fresh, and for the prices charged, one would expect something better than mediocre. The chicken was overcooked, and the salad appeared old, evidenced by wilted lettuce and browning avocado. The signature dish, the rib-eye steak, which was supposed to be \\"seared to perfection,\\" was horribly overdone and lacked seasoning. Additionally, the cleanliness levels were abhorrent. The utensils were smeared with dried food, and the restrooms were not in a clean state, which raises concerns about hygiene standards in the establishment's kitchens. All these issues combine to give an impression of carelessness and a lack of pride in their establishment. To add salt to the wound, their prices were inflated for the quality provided. Considering the subpar food, absent service, and questionable cleanliness, the price point is exorbitant. They're charging fine-dining prices for an experience that doesn't remotely resemble such. A saving grace could have been the drink selection which appeared vast, offering an array of unique cocktails and an extensive wine list. However, the positives, sadly did not outweigh the negatives. One good attribute can't make up for the numerous other areas where this establishment was lacking. In summary, the overall experience at this restaurant was a profound disappointment. I left feeling frustrated, rather than satisfied and relaxed- as one should feel after a supposed dining experience. Unless there's a massive overhaul in staff training, food preparation, and cleanliness, I won't be returning or recommending this place to friends or family."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

My new home in Florida was thousands of miles away from anything I knew. It was hot--all the time. Jobs were hard to come by, but I was up for almost any challenge. At last, I taught in a special school where students have severe learning and behavioral difficulties. Another teacher and I had spent weeks teaching the children appropriate behavior for public outings. Unexpectedly, only a few students, including Kyle, had not earned the privilege of going. He was determined to make his disappointment known. In the corridor between classrooms, he began screaming, cursing, spitting, and swinging at anything within striking distance. Once his outburst died down, he did what he'd done when he was angry at all his other schools, at home, even once at a juvenile detention center. He ran. People watched in disbelief as Kyle dashed straight into the heavy morning traffic in front of the school. I heard someone shout, \\"Call the police!\\" But I ran after him. Kyle was at least a foot taller than me. And he was fast. His older brothers were track stars at the nearby high school. But I could run long distances without tiring. I would at least be able to keep him in my sight and know he was alive. After several blocks of running directly into oncoming traffic, Kyle slowed his pace. He took a sharp left. Standing next to a trash bin, Kyle bent over with his hands on his knees. I must have looked ridiculous. But his was not a look of fear. I saw his body relax. He did not attempt to run again. Kyle stood still and watched me approach. I had no idea what I was going to say or do, but I kept walking closer. He opened his mouth to speak when a police car pulled up, abruptly filling the space between Kyle and me. The school principal and an officer got out. They spoke calmly to Kyle, who willingly climbed into the back of the vehicle. I couldn't hear what was said, but I didn't take my eyes off Kyle's face, even as they drove away. I couldn't help but feel that I had failed him, that I should have done or said more, that I should have fixed the situation. I shared my feelings with a speech therapist who was familiar with Kyle's history. \\"No one ever ran after him before, Rachel,\\" she said. \\"No one. They just let him go.\\" Things changed the day he ran and I ran after him, even though I didn't have the right words, even though I wasn't able to save him from the mess he was in.

She thought really hard and came up with an idea. The girl found some string in her garage, a long, bendy stick in her backyard, and some tape to put it all together. With her creative mind, she made a new fishing rod using the stick, string, and tape. She tied the string onto the stick and the new lure to the end of the string. Now, she was very excited, and all ready to go fishing! She walked to the nearby pond where she had seen her grandpa fishing before. She held her homemade fishing rod tightly and swung it back and forth, casting the lure out into the water. The pretty lure sparkled and danced in the water, making ripples that looked like tiny waves. As she sat down on the grass, she carefully watched the little toy fish swimming around, waiting for a real fish to come closer. Soon enough, she saw some fish gathering around her lure, curious and interested. \\"One of them will bite sooner or later,\\" the little girl thought, as she patiently waited. And suddenly, she felt a strong tug on her fishing rod! The little girl held on tightly and began reeling in the string. As the fish came closer, she could see it was a beautiful rainbow-colored fish that sparkled just like her lure. With a big smile, she pulled the fish out of the water and looked at her amazing catch. The little girl proved that even with a broken fishing rod, she could still go fishing and have a great time. It's all about being patient, creative, and never giving up!

The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum or Suhail, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.83. It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.6 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 280,000 times as luminous, is around 30 times as massive and is 17 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 35,000 K.

Which language is this?","completion":"This text is in Turkish. Here is a detailed and long answer about the Turkish language: The Turkish language, known as \\"Türkçe\\" in Turkish, belongs to the Ural-Altaic language family, and it is the official language of Turkey and Cyprus. It is also spoken by Turkish communities in other countries, such as Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Greece. The modern Turkish language has its roots in the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. Over the centuries, it has been influenced by Persian, Arabic, and more recently, French and English vocabulary. A distinctive feature of Turkish is its agglutinative nature, meaning that affixes are added to root words to indicate grammatical roles, moods, tenses, and other meanings. These agglutinative structures allow for the creation of long compound words, which can convey complex ideas in just one word. The grammar and syntax of Turkish are quite different from those of Indo-European languages, and the word order usually follows the subject-object-verb (SOV) pattern. In comparison to other languages, word order in Turkish is quite flexible and can change for emphasis. The Turkish alphabet is based on the Latin script, consisting of 29 letters. While it includes several characters found in the English alphabet, it also has unique letters such as 'ç', 'ğ', 'ş', and 'ı'. This modern alphabet was introduced in 1928, as part of the language reform initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, to replace the Ottoman Turkish script, which was written in Arabic script. Over the years, the Turkish language has experienced various changes and reforms. One such reform was the elimination of many Persian and Arabic loanwords. This process, known as \\"language purification,\\" aimed to replace these loanwords with Turkish equivalents in order to enhance the national identity and increase the intelligibility of the language among native speakers. Today, Turkish continues to evolve and incorporate new vocabulary from English and other languages, reflecting Turkey's desire to modernize and engage in global trade and communication. In terms of learning Turkish, its regular and systematic grammar, along with its simple phonetics, make it relatively easy for speakers of other languages to learn. However, the agglutinative nature of Turkish, as well as the different word order, may pose challenges for learners who are more familiar with Indo-European languages. In conclusion, Turkish is an intriguing and vibrant language with a rich history and cultural significance. As Turkey's importance in the geopolitical landscape and global economy grows, interest in learning and understanding the Turkish language is likely to increase accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An abandoned ship crashes into a dockyard in Brooklyn, New York, and the ship inspector, Silas Green, finds it full of corpses. Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a suave, mysterious vampire (who arrived on the ship in his intricately carved coffin), intervenes and kills them. Soon after, Maximillian infects Julius with his vampiric blood, before Julius turning into a decaying ghoul and claiming that it has benefits; he then explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the Dhampir daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon. This Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, who is still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, are in the middle of investigating the murders on the ship, Rita begins having strange visions about a woman who looks like her, and begins asking questions about her mother's past. When she tells Justice about having \\"a strange feeling\\" about the investigation, he is skeptical, which frustrates Rita. The visions are presumably influenced in part by her vampire heritage; this is hinted at a few times throughout the first two-thirds of the story. Rita is completely unaware of this heritage, and believes she is losing her mind, similar to what happened to her mother. Meanwhile, Maximillian initiates a series of sinister methods to find out more about Rita and to further pull her into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki,... My question: What is the ship inspector's name?

Some years later, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to crack encrypted enemy telecommunication. Nash can decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other decrypters.

Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. I am facing a new situation today: Bill was studying the states of matter. First, he selected a matter with low boiling point. He labeled it as matter A.

Choices: - parallel circuit - constant circuit - dramatic circuit - series circuit A: Answer:","completion":"A series circuit is the type of circuit wherein there is only one loop, which, if interrupted at any point, causes the cessation of the whole circuit's electric current. This is because all the components in a series circuit are connected end-to-end in a single path, allowing the electric current to flow through each component successively. In a series circuit, the current remains constant throughout the circuit, but the voltage is divided across the components. This means that the total voltage is equal to the sum of the voltage drops across each component. The total resistance in a series circuit is also the sum of the resistances of each individual component. In contrast, a parallel circuit has multiple paths through which current can flow. If one path is interrupted, the current will still be able to flow through the other paths, keeping the circuit operational. In parallel circuits, the voltage remains constant across each branch, while the currents add up to provide the total current.

Their behavior likely has little to do with you and is mostly caused by their past. They may not know any other way than what they are doing. Suggest that the person abusing you seek professional help. You likely know how helpful talking to someone can be, as you may do it yourself because of your depression. Therapy may help this person heal from their past and stop the abuse. People who feel overlooked or weak in certain areas of their lives may feel the need to seek power and control in others. The feelings that are created during the abuse may give this person the ego boost they need in order to handle feeling unrecognized in other aspects of their life. For example, if the abuser is talked down to by their friends, never gets a promotion at work, or is treated poorly by their family, they may look to you as their source of power. Abusing and having control over you may be compensation for not receiving the treatment they feel they deserve. You likely understand how having poor mental health can take complete control over your life, as a person with mental illness yourself. Someone who has a mental illness may not realize that what they are doing is inappropriate or may not be able to handle their emotions. By no means does this mean what they are doing is right, but it may not be something they can help. Those with anger management issues are often unable to control their explosive emotions and can take it out on others in the form of abuse. Additionally, people who have drug or alcohol problems may resort to abuse because they aren’t capable of handling how they feel. Abusers are often insecure. They may feel jealous of the person they abuse and exhibit the horrible behavior to make that person feel just as bad as they do. They may also do it because they feel it’s the only way to keep the person near them. For instance, in domestic relationships, the abuser may feel so badly about themselves they fear their partner is going to leave them. They exhibit mental and emotional abuse as a way to control the partner and ultimately stop them from seeing other people and potentially leaving them. Try having friends and family who witness the abuse mention to the abuser that what they are doing is not okay. This will help to make them more aware of how they are behaving.","completion":"Sometimes, people who have been hurt in the past might hurt others because they don't know a better way to act. It's not your fault, but the person hurting you might need to talk to someone like a doctor or therapist to help them feel better and stop hurting people. They might feel like they don't get enough attention or feel important, so they try to control someone else to feel better. Some people have a hard time controlling their emotions because of things going on in their brain or because they use things that change how they feel like drugs or alcohol. People who hurt others might be scared and worried about people leaving them, so they try to control them to keep them close. If someone you love sees this happening, they can tell the person it's not okay to help them understand their actions are wrong."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Bernard Mathew Leadon III (pronounced led-un; born July 19, 1947) is an American musician and songwriter, best known as a founding member of the Eagles. Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three pioneering and highly influential country rock bands: Hearts & Flowers, Dillard & Clark, and the Flying Burrito Brothers. He is a multi-instrumentalist (guitar, banjo, mandolin, steel guitar, dobro) coming from a bluegrass background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles. Context: Leadon was the last original member to join the Eagles, a band initially formed by guitarist/singer Glenn Frey, drummer/singer Don Henley, and former Poco bassist/singer Randy Meisner. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the band's early country-rock sound, bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country, bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were electric guitar, B-Bender, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, dobro and pedal steel guitar. Upon the release of their debut album, Eagles, the group met with near instantaneous success, due largely to the strength of their hit singles, \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" and \\"Witchy Woman\\" (co-written by Leadon and Henley), all of which highlighted Leadon's multi-instrumental talent on electric guitar, B-Bender, banjo, and harmony vocals. Their follow-up, Desperado, was another strong country-rock venture highlighted by the classics \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and the title track. Leadon had a prominent role on the album, but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result, the band attempted to distance itself from the \\"country rock\\" label for their third album On the Border. In doing so, Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend, guitarist Don Felder, to the band. The result was the guitar-heavy top ten hit \\"Already Gone\\". The album also included \\"My Man\\", Leadon's touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend, Gram Parsons, who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at Joshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California. With the wild success of On the Border and its follow-up smash, One of These Nights, tension within the band grew, as Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the band's direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass and toward album-oriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Frey's head. He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring, recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band. Upon his departure, Asylum Records released Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), which highlighted the band's Leadon years and went on to become the biggest-selling album of all time for sales in excess of 42 million units, awarded to the band members by the RIAA. He was replaced by former James Gang guitarist/singer, Joe Walsh. Although it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013: \\"That's an oversimplification; it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play Fender Telecaster. I played a Gibson Les Paul and I enjoyed rock & roll. That's evident from the early albums.\\" Question: Who else was in the band? Answer:","completion":"In addition to Bernie Leadon, the founding members of the Eagles included guitarist/singer Glenn Frey, drummer/singer Don Henley, and bassist/singer Randy Meisner. As the band evolved, other members joined and contributed to the Eagles' sound and success. After the release of their third album \\"On the Border,\\" guitarist Don Felder was recruited to join the band, a suggestion made by Leadon himself. Felder brought a more rock-oriented guitar sound, which became a prominent element in the Eagles' music. Following Leadon's departure in 1975, Joe Walsh, former guitarist/singer of the James Gang, replaced him, further solidifying the Eagles' move towards a rock and roll sound. Throughout the years, the lineup of the Eagles experienced a few more changes. After Randy Meisner left the band in 1977, he was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit, who was another former member of the band Poco. When the Eagles reunited in 1994 after a 14-year hiatus, the lineup was Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and Timothy B. Schmit. Guitarist Don Felder left the band in 2001, and the group later added Steuart Smith as a touring musician to fill the guitar role. In summary, the Eagles formed with the original members Bernie Leadon, Glenn Frey, Don Henley, and Randy Meisner. Throughout the band's history, Don Felder, Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit, and later, Steuart Smith joined the lineup, each contributing to the evolving sound of the band."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tax rises and benefit cuts passed by the Coalition have cost the average household £1,127 a year – with the poorest families with children the hardest hit, a new report has revealed. While the richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms, poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Middle earners and the very rich have escaped 'remarkably unscathed' from the Government's austerity programme - with those without children actually gaining financially from the changes, largely due to increases in the threshold for paying income tax, said the IFS. The richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms since 2010, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. But poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income, the respected economic think tank said. Pensioners were 'relatively unaffected' on average, as their gains from the 'triple lock' on the state pension were largely offset by the hike in VAT. Labour said the findings were proof of a 'clear betrayal' by David Cameron of his promise to lead the most family-friendly Government ever. Looking at these changes, the poorest households lost around 4 per cent of their incomes, compared with around 3.5 per cent for the next poorest tenth, between 2.5 per cent and zero for middle-income households and a loss of about 2.5 per cent for the richest. The IFS found that families with four or more children lost 6.9 per cent of their income as a result of the tax and benefit changes under study - an average £2,941 - compared with a loss of 4.5 per cent for three-child families, 3.5 per cent for those with two children, 2.6 per cent for those with one and 0.4 per cent for childless households. Non-working lone parents were the worst-hit household type, losing about £1,837 a year from the changes under study, though the IFS said the average loss was skewed upwards by a small number of households affected by measures such as the benefits cap and national caps on local housing allowance rates. Hardest-hit region was Greater London, where households lost an average £1,042, followed by the South East, West Midlands and North West. James Browne, a senior research economist at IFS and co-author of the report said: 'Whichever way you cut it, low-income households with children and the very richest households have lost out significantly from the changes as a percentage of their incomes. 'Increases in the tax-free personal allowance have played an important role in protecting middle-income working-age households meaning that those without children have actually gained overall.' The hardest-hit region is Greater London, where households have lost an average £1,042 a year, followed by the South East, West Midlands and North West. The Chancellor George Osborne has introduced tax rises and benefit cuts costing the average family more than £1,000 a year. Labour Treasury spokeswoman Cathy Jamieson said: 'This report shows that tax and benefit changes under this Government have left households £1,127 a year worse off on average. 'Families with children have been hit hardest of all by David Cameron's choices - a clear betrayal of his promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever. 'For all the Government's claims, this report shows that they have raised tax by over £13.5 billion a year. And for millions of working people the rise in VAT and cuts to things like tax credits have more than offset changes to the personal allowance. 'The Tories are now promising to cut tax credits again for millions of working families and refusing to rule out another VAT rise to pay for their unfunded promises. It's clear working people can't afford five more years of this Government. 'Labour's economic plan will ensure we earn our way to rising living standards for all and balance the books in a fairer way. We will reverse this Government's £3 billion-a-year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners and help 24 million working people with a lower 10p starting rate of tax.' A Treasury spokeswoman said: 'Today's report from the IFS confirms that the richest have lost the most from the Government's changes to taxes and welfare. 'Treasury analysis has shown throughout the Parliament that the richest 10 per cent of households have made the largest contribution to reducing the deficit. 'The Treasury presents the most complete, rigorous and detailed record of the impact of this Government's policies on households. At the Autumn Statement this confirmed that the richest 20 per cent of households will contribute more to reducing the deficit than the remaining 80 per cent put together. 'Fairness is at the heart of our approach to reducing the deficit. Our analysis shows how our commitment to fairness is not a matter of rhetoric: it is reflected in the policy choices we have made. 'UK income inequality is now lower than when this Government came into office and the recovery is being felt across the country. But the only sustainable way to raise living standards for all is to keep working through the plan that is securing a better future across the country.'

The question is about the format of phone numbers being split into 3 and 4-digit groups, not about local area codes or making local calls without area codes. A more accurate answer would be: Phone numbers are split into 3 and 4-digit groups due to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) implemented in the 1940s. The NANP format consists of a 3-digit area code, followed by a 3-digit exchange (or local) code, and finally a 4-digit subscriber (or line) number. The area code is intended to designate a specific geographic region, while the exchange code refers to a smaller local area within the region. The subscriber number is unique to an individual phone line within the exchange area.

Given the following passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy.

The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint. Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Hello little buddy! Let's try to understand these questions one at a time. 1. \\"What is the average IQ of Jews?\\": People have different levels of intelligence, which can be measured using something called an IQ (Intelligence Quotient) test. Jews are a group of people who share a common religion called Judaism. There are many smart Jewish people, but their average IQ is similar to the general population. It's important to remember that not everyone within a group will have the same IQ, and people from different groups can be equally intelligent. 2. \\"How did Ashkenazi Jews become so intelligent?\\": Ashkenazi Jews are a specific group of Jewish people who come from Europe. There are some theories about why they might seem to do well in areas like science and education. These include their focus on learning and education within their culture, and having to think creatively and solve problems when faced with challenges in history. Regardless, it is important to remember that intelligence comes in many forms and can be found in every group of people. 3. \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\": No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about the average IQ of all Jewish people, while the second question is specifically about Ashkenazi Jews and the reasons they might seem intelligent. Meanwhile, the third question is more of a comparison between the first two questions. Remember, intelligence is unique to every individual, and no single group is inherently more intelligent than another. People have different skills, strengths, and talents, and we can always learn from each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left £25,000 (equivalent to about £3 million as of 2019) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive £100 (£13,000 as of 2019), and that £400 (£53,000 as of 2019) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the £400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid.

I read this background article the other day: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6] Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7] With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7] I am facing a new situation today: Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town is experiencing less bad odor?","completion":"To answer the question correctly, let's go through the information provided step by step: 1. The background article highlights that poor waste management, especially municipal waste, can lead to numerous problems, such as the incidence and prevalence of diseases and contamination of ground water. 2. Biomedical wastes pose a significant danger in Bangladesh, and 20% of it is considered \\"highly infectious\\" and often disposed into the sewage system or drains. This can cause dangerous consequences for both the health of the residents and the environment. 3. The article mentions poor sanitation is connected with child mortality and solid waste, which can lead to blockages in the drainage system, flooding, mosquitoes, and bad odor. Now, let's focus on the new situation: Town A: Disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years. Town B: Took biomedical waste to an ecological site to prevent affecting ground water and spreading disease. Based on the given information, Town B has been managing its biomedical waste more responsibly by depositing it in an ecological site to minimize the risk associated with contamination and disease spread. This measure likely helps to avoid problems related to poor sanitation mentioned in the background article, which includes bad odor. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that Town B is experiencing less bad odor compared to Town A."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the heaviest snowfalls have been reported in the mountains of other areas during winter. Snow is even known to fall near the Equator ,but only on the highest mountains. Snow contains much less water than rain, but much of the water the world uses comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often. However, they can avoid becoming victims of snowstorms. People should stop driving and stay at home until the storm has passed.

Read this: Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria.

He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches. and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Please answer this question : Which fruit retained their quality longer, apples or peaches? A:","completion":"Candied apples would retain their quality longer than fresh peaches. Since apples have been candied by Dan in this situation, and peaches are left fresh, the candied apples will be preserved by the sugar absorption process, allowing them to last longer and retain their quality for up to a year.

But as he walks through the office door, and knows he's going to be surrounded by staff looking to him for advice, he grows into a fully mature man. And I think it's a mistake to imagine that we all feel, as we age, a kind of progression of states, from the baby to the adult. Most people feel, on Tuesday, about three years old, and on a Wednesday, around 80. I remember feeling very grown-up at eight, a time when I was weighed down with responsibility. These days, much older, I can, in the company of people I feel at ease with, feel like a young girl. There's a common remark that \\"all men are little boys\\", but it's not true. It's more true that men often behave like little boys. But nearly all people, at some moments in their lives, are able of great maturity. Once your baby arrives, you'll soon feel less childlike, or rather, less often. When your child tries to put its fingers into the electric plug, the adult in you will rise up to prevent it. You'll see you have very little in common with a needy child, particularly if it's looking to you for comfort and support. Comfort yourself, David, with two truths. One is that your friends laugh when they talk about this subject because they, like you, feel frightened. And remember that people who haven't grown up don't go around talking about the fact that they don't feel grown-up. Hope my advice will be helpful and good luck to you and your little one.

Pour the beans onto a large, flat baking sheet and spread them out until they're distributed across the entire surface. Sift through the beans by hand and pick out any foreign object you find.","completion":"Once you have meticulously removed any debris or unwanted materials from the beans, gather them up and place them into a large, deep bowl. Measure out a generous amount of water, approximately three to four times the volume of the beans, ensuring that the beans will be fully submerged while they soak. Pour the water slowly over the beans, taking care not to displace the beans as you want them to remain settled at the bottom of the bowl. As the water level rises, you may notice any remaining dirt or impurities floating to the surface; this is completely normal and a sign that the soaking process is working effectively. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, ensuring that it's not too tight as the beans will need some room to expand as they absorb water. Set the bowl aside in a cool, draft-free spot in your kitchen or pantry, allowing the beans to soak for at least eight hours, or overnight if possible. Keep in mind that the larger the beans, the longer they may need to soak. Additionally, older beans may require a longer soaking time compared to fresher ones. Throughout the soaking process, you may want to check on the beans periodically to see if they need any additional water. If you notice that the water level has significantly decreased or that the beans are no longer fully submerged, add more water as needed. This ensures that the beans are consistently hydrating, which will ultimately help in softening them and reducing their cooking time. After the beans have soaked for the appropriate amount of time, drain the water and give them a thorough rinse under cold running water. This step is crucial in washing away any lingering dirt or impurities that may have been released during the soaking process. Once the beans are well-rinsed, they are now ready to be cooked according to your preferred recipe. By soaking your beans prior to cooking, you are not only ensuring that they will cook more evenly and efficiently, but you are also unlocking the beans' full nutritional potential. Additionally, this process can help to reduce any potential digestive discomfort that can sometimes be associated with consuming beans. With this knowledge and technique in hand, you can now confidently prepare a wide variety of delicious and nutritious bean dishes for yourself, your family, and your friends to enjoy."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Which body part did Lance Harper injure?

Answer the following question: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal. Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's consider the factors that contribute to the corrosion of iron. As mentioned in the given information, the process of rusting involves oxidation of iron to iron(II) ions and then to iron(III) oxide when it reacts with water and oxygen. This means that the presence of water and oxygen are essential for the corrosion process to occur. Now, comparing the two environments - a dry area such as a desert, and a damp area like a rainforest: 1. In a dry environment like a desert, the amount of water present is minimal. The lack of moisture reduces the chances of iron coming into contact with water and oxygen, slowing down the corrosion process. 2. In a damp environment like a rainforest, there is an abundance of moisture. The high levels of humidity mean that the iron is constantly exposed to water and oxygen. This promotes the redox process and causes the iron to corrode at a faster rate. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that iron left in a damp area like a rainforest will corrode faster than iron left in a dry area such as a desert."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please add spaces between words: Itcantypicallybespottedinoilsampleswheretheoilistranslucent/milky.","completion":"The sentence you've given with spaces added becomes: \\"It can typically be spotted in oil samples where the oil is translucent/milky.\\" When the spaces are added, we can see that the sentence is discussing an unspecified subject that can often be detected or noticed in specific types of oil samples. These samples are characterized by their oil being either translucent, meaning semi-transparent, allowing some light to pass through them, or milky, implying that the oil may appear to be cloudy or lacking in transparency. This could be referring to a variety of things depending on the broader context of the statement. For instance, if the content is from an oil analysis context, it might refer to a particular substance or contamination that shows up in oil samples under these conditions. It could be something like water contamination, as water can cause oil to appear milky, or perhaps it could be a certain type of particulate matter or sediment. In the engine oil analysis practice, visible signs often are the first indicators of potential problem, and such attributes of the oil as being translucent or milky are signals for a deeper analysis. If your oil appears milky or translucent, this could indicate coolant leak or other contamination that may interfere with the oil's ability to lubricate the engine properly. On the other hand, if the oil is just translucent without any milky appearance, it could simply be a characteristic of that particular type of oil. In conclusion, the phrase when spaces are added refers to the typical detectability of a certain, unspecified element or issue within oil samples, notably when the oil within these samples is either translucent or milky."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list.

Movie title: My Brilliant Career Movie plot: The heroine, Sybylla Melvyn, is an imaginative, headstrong girl growing up in rural Australia in the 1890s. Drought and a series of poor business decisions reduce her family to subsistance level, her father begins to drink excessively, and Sybylla struggles to deal with the monotony of her life. To her relief, she is sent to live on her grandmother's property, where life is more comfortable. There she meets wealthy young Harry Beecham, who loves her and proposes marriage; convinced of her ugliness and aware of her tomboyish ways, Sybylla is unable to believe that he could really love her. By this time, her father's drinking has got the family into debt, and she is sent to work as governess/housekeeper for the family of an almost illiterate neighbour to whom her father owes money. She becomes acclaimated to this life to the point where it is almost bearable, but to her relief (again) is sent home (this time) to keep her away from her crass employer's son who has apparantely fallen for her (and, ironically, since she has no property, she is deemed unsuitable as the son's mate). When Harry Beecham returns to ask Sybylla to marry him, she concludes that she would only make him unhappy and sends him away, determined to pursue her career as a writer. The movie ending completes the suggestion, made at the begining, that this entire screenplay is based on her first book, as we see her putting the manuscript in a mailbox in front of her parent's ramshacle house. (A suggestion that this movie is the story of her Brilliant Career.....or how it got its start anyway).","completion":"Sybylla Melvyn, the protagonist of the movie \\"My Brilliant Career,\\" is first sent to live on her grandmother's property. This occurs due to the difficult circumstances her family faces, which include financial struggles, her father's excessive drinking, and the monotony of life in rural Australia during the 1890s. Living on her grandmother's property provides Sybylla with a more comfortable environment, where she meets the wealthy young Harry Beecham. Throughout the movie, Sybylla experiences various challenges and opportunities. She receives a marriage proposal from Harry, but due to her insecurities about her appearance and tomboyish behavior, she struggles to believe that he genuinely loves her. Additionally, Sybylla faces tougher times when her family's debt forces her to work as a governess and housekeeper for a neighbor's family in order to repay her father's loans. In her new role, Sybylla finds herself becoming accustomed to her surroundings, but is eventually sent back home in order to distance herself from the employer's son who falls for her. Despite her desire for a career as a writer, she encounters societal pressures and expectations regarding marriage and her role as a woman. When Harry Beecham returns, Sybylla is faced with the difficult decision of marrying him or pursuing her dreams of writing. Ultimately, she decides that marrying Harry would only lead to unhappiness for both of them and chooses to follow her passion for writing instead. This decision marks the beginning of Sybylla's brilliant career, as suggested by the movie's ending, which shows her mailing her manuscript from her parent's humble home. The film presents the story as a reflection of Sybylla's journey of self-discovery, growth, and her determination to create a life on her own terms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Makenzie Wethington, now 19, suffered internal injuries as well as a broken pelvis, lumbar spine, and shoulder blade in the Jan. 25, 2014, skydive in Oklahoma, reports the Dallas Morning News. After a negligence lawsuit, a judge ordered Robert Swainson, owner of the now-closed Pegasus Air Sports business, to pay Wethington 400,000 for physical suffering, 350,000 for mental suffering, and 10,000 for future medical expenses. Wethington, whose lawsuit alleged that she wasn't given proper training and that she was given the wrong parachute for her skill level, told the judge that after she jumped from the plane, her lines became tangled and she blacked out as she spun out of control, the Oklahoman reports. The next thing she remembers is waking up in a hospital bed. Swainson, who now lives in the UK, argued that she \\"injured herself\\" by panicking \\"when things did not go exactly as expected.\\" After the accident, the US Parachuting Association raised the minimum age to 18, a limit that was already in place in most states.

Expand this summary.","completion":"Makenzie Wethington, a Texas resident, was just 16 years old when she received a skydiving experience as a birthday present in 2014. However, the thrilling gift turned into a near-death experience as her parachute malfunctioned at approximately 3,500 feet during the jump in Oklahoma. Wethington is now 19 years old and has been awarded 760,000 in compensation for her traumatic ordeal. The parachute malfunction resulted in Wethington suffering internal injuries, a broken pelvis, lumbar spine, and shoulder blade. The subsequent negligence lawsuit found Robert Swainson, the owner of the now-closed Pegasus Air Sports business, responsible for the accident, and a judge ordered him to pay her 400,000 for her physical suffering, 350,000 for mental suffering, and 10,000 for future medical expenses. Wethington's lawsuit alleged that she did not receive proper training for the skydive and the parachute she was given was not appropriate for her skill level. After jumping from the plane, her parachute lines became tangled, causing her to spin out of control and ultimately lose consciousness. The next memory Wethington has of the incident is waking up in a hospital bed. Swainson, who currently resides in the UK, defended himself by claiming that Wethington \\"injured herself\\" by panicking during the jump when the situation did not go exactly as she expected. Despite Swainson's argument, the compensation was awarded to Wethington. Following this unfortunate incident, the US Parachuting Association decided to raise the minimum age for skydiving to 18, a restriction already in place in most states, to prevent such accidents from occurring to minors in the future. This case highlights the importance of proper training, equipment, and age restrictions for high-risk activities such as skydiving.

But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land ( Figure below ). High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. I am facing a new situation today: Two coastal cities, Dune and Shore, got a Hurricane warning. The hurricane hit Dune city, but missed Shore city by 50 miles. The damage was horrendous. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, we can infer that Dune city experienced a lower atmospheric pressure compared to Shore city, due to the direct hit from the hurricane. However, the question asks which city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure. In this case, we can conclude that Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure. Here is the reasoning behind the answer: Hurricanes have a characteristic structure, with a low-pressure eye at the center, surrounded by high-intensity winds and rain. The eye of the hurricane is marked by a very low pressure, which is much lower than the atmospheric pressure outside the storm system. In the case of the new situation mentioned, Dune city was directly hit by the hurricane, which means it was exposed to the low-pressure eye of the storm or at least the outer bands of strong winds and rain where the pressure is still comparatively lower than in areas not directly affected by the hurricane. On the other hand, Shore city was not directly hit by the hurricane, as it was 50 miles away from the storm's path. This means that the city was not exposed to the extremely low pressure found in the hurricane's eye or to the more intense outer bands of rain and wind. Therefore, the atmospheric pressure in Shore city would be higher compared to Dune city during the hurricane event. In conclusion, Shore city experienced a higher atmospheric pressure as it was not directly hit by the hurricane, unlike Dune city which was directly in the storm's path and thus exposed to the low pressure eye and intense weather conditions associated with hurricanes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

John, Evelyn, Georgie and Bernice are very likeable; Deborah, however, is uptight, her behavior often upsetting both households. Summer comes and Flor is needed 24/7 at the Claskys' summer home. Unable to communicate well in English, Deborah finds a neighbor to interpret. Flor reveals that she is unable to maintain these hours because she has a daughter, so Cristina is invited to come stay with them. Cristina interprets for her mother. She impresses Deborah, who begins to treat her like a daughter, taking Cristina shopping, getting her hair done, enrolling her in a private school, and showing her more love than she does the sensitive Bernice. Flor becomes unhappy when it appears that Cristina is influenced by Deborah, in part because she wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values, and partly because Deborah is overstepping her bounds. Flor objects to Deborah's actions to John, who apologizes. Flor loses her temper when she finds out that John has given Cristina over 600 in cash for a minor task. She threatens to leave but John convinces her to stay for Cristina's sake. Flor begins to learn English so she can communicate better.

To delve into the details, the premise can be broken down into three key aspects: 1. \\"Apart from a few choice flashbacks\\" - This suggests that there might be a few moments in the story where the narrative deviates from the linear progression temporarily, taking the audience back in time to past events. However, these instances are rare and specifically chosen, not a persistent focus throughout the piece. 2. \\"The action is crawlingly linear\\" - The term \\"crawlingly\\" may imply that the progression is slow or perhaps even tedious, but it is still linear, meaning that it follows a straight sequence of events. The use of \\"crawlingly\\" might emphasize the contrast between the limited non-linear instances (the flashbacks) and the overall linearity of the action. 3. \\"Opaque\\" - This word could refer to the storytelling method or the content itself. Opaque usually means difficult to understand or not transparent in terms of clarity. So, while the action may be linear, unfolding in a clear sequential manner, the overall plot or certain story aspects can still be challenging to comprehend, demonstrating that linearity does not necessarily equate to total clarity. In conclusion, the premise does not support the hypothesis that the action is non-linear. On the contrary, it emphasizes the linear nature of the story, with some rare instances of flashbacks only slightly deviating from the linearity. However, the story's opacity illustrates that, despite following a linear path, the plot or some aspects of the story might still be difficult to understand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 177*c + 841 + 1363 = 119*c for c. Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this equation step by step. We have 177 * c + 841 + 1363 = 119 * c. First, let me explain what this equation means. There is a number called 'c' that we have to find. We know that if you multiply 'c' by 177, and then add 841 and 1363, you get the same result as when you multiply 'c' by 119. Now, let's follow these steps: 1. Combine the numbers that don't have 'c' by adding them together: 841 + 1363 = 2204 So now we have: 177 * c + 2204 = 119 * c 2. Now, let's subtract \\"119 * c\\" from both sides of the equation to get all the 'c' terms on one side. 177 * c - 119 * c + 2204 = 119 * c - 119 * c This becomes: (177 - 119) * c + 2204 = 0 3. Calculate 177 - 119 = 58 Now we have: 58 * c + 2204 = 0 4. Next, we will move the 2204 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides: 58 * c = -2204 5. Finally, let's find the value of 'c' by dividing both sides by 58: c = -2204 / 58 6. When we divide -2204 by 58, we get: c = -38 So the value of 'c' is -38."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Friction generates heat, and the test mentions that riding on grass generates more friction than riding on snow.

Review title: BLEND OF ROCK AND POP NOT TO MY TASTE!! Product review: Granted that Reba likes to do things in a big, big way. But she falls short on this CD which is probably the most overdone of all of her work. But that's not why I don't like it. I've had enough of country artists demeaning themselves to record the kind of stuff she does here which is a blend of rock and pop tunes like \\"Invisible\\" and \\"One Honest Heart\\" to name a couple. Reba is too good for tripe like this. Answer:","completion":"This review would, generally speaking, decrease the chances of buying the product, which in this scenario is a music album by Reba McEntire. The reviewer does not appear satisfied with the product, evidently because their taste in music didn't align with the blend of styles presented in this album - namely, the mix of rock and pop. However, their feelings are subjective, and your opinion might differ if you enjoy this blend of musical styles. The review is notably negative, not only because the reviewer thought the album was \\"overdone,\\" but they also use unfavorable phrases like \\"Reba falls short on this CD\\" and refers to the songs as \\"tripe,\\" implying that they felt the quality was poor. Furthermore, the reviewer bemoans the fact that they believe country artists are \\"demeaning themselves\\" by producing music that's a blend of rock and pop. This sentiment suggests the reviewer favors traditional country music and is disappointed in Reba for stepping outside this genre. However, this review's effectiveness also depends on your musical tastes. If, for instance, you appreciate albums with a blend of rock and pop, you might disagree with the reviewer, and their harsh opinion could even increase your interest in the album. Even the songs mentioned as examples—\\"Invisible\\" and \\"One Honest Heart\\"—could pique your interest if you already favor rock/pop combinations. Simply put, while the core tone of the review is largely unfavorable and might generally decrease the product's appeal, your personal preferences will significantly influence how persuasively you find it. You may decide to listen to a few tracks or previews before making a purchase to see if your tastes align with the reviewer's or not. But purely from the tone and content of this review, it is likely to decrease the chances of buying the product, unless you have a preference for the blend of rock and pop in country music."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

But with the same setting in Stockholm, Sweden.On his birthday, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), retired CEO of Vanger Industries, receives a pressed flower in the mail from an anonymous sender and phones retired inspector Gustaf Morell (Donald Sumpter).Co-owner of the magazine Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is swarmed by reporters as he leaves a courthouse, having lost a libel suit leveled against him by corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg). His reputation destroyed and his life savings gone, Blomkvist returns to the office and informs his co-owner Erika Berger (Robin Wright), who is also his lover, that he is resigning.Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), the attorney of Henrik Vanger, meets with Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic) at the headquarters of Milton Security, having requested a background check on Blomkvist. Armansky has arranged for Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a girl in her twenties with multiple tattoos and facial piercings who is his best researcher and computer hacker, to come in and personally report her findings on Blomkvist.On Christmas Day, Blomkvist receives a phone call from Frode summoning him to the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island in Hedestad for a face-to-face meeting with Henrik. Upon his arrival, Henrik explains that he is interested in hiring Blomkvist to investigate the murder of his niece Harriet Vanger, who disappeared from the island over 40 years ago. Before she vanished, Harriet would give Henrik a pressed flower for his birthday every year, a tradition that he believes has been continued by the person responsible for her disappearance. Convinced that someone in the family murdered Harriet, Henrik will allow Blomkvist to conduct his investigation out of a cottage on the island, under the guise of writing a memoir about Henrik and his life. Blomkvist is reluctant to accept, until Henrik offers him incriminating evidence that would validate his claims... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", the numbers in Harriet's diary are references to Bible verses. These numbers are crucial to understanding the mystery surrounding Harriet's disappearance and the connection to a series of murders. During his investigation, Mikael Blomkvist comes across Harriet's diary, in which he finds a list of names and numbers. At first, the significance of these numbers is unclear; however, it isn't long before Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander - the talented hacker who ends up helping him with the case - discover that these numbers correspond to specific passages in the Book of Leviticus in the Bible. Each number is made up of three parts: a chapter number, a verse number, and a letter. These passages highlight brutal violence against women, which turns out to be the key to unraveling the greater mystery. The names in the diary correspond to the victims of a serial killer who had been active for decades, and the numbers symbolize the biblical verses which were used as justifications for their brutal murders. In summary, the numbers in Harriet's diary reference specific Bible verses linked to the murders committed by the serial killer whom Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are trying to catch. These verses reveal a pattern and a motive behind the murders, eventually helping them solve the case and uncover the truth behind Harriet's disappearance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The electrode was left by ions.","completion":"Hello little buddy! A linguist is someone who studies language, and they usually know a lot about grammar too. Grammar is like the rules for talking and writing, so that we can understand each other. Now, let's look at the sentence: \\"The electrode was left by ions.\\" An electrode is a little tool used to help with electricity, and ions are tiny particles that float around and can help create electricity. So, the sentence talks about the electrode being left by ions. Now, about grammar! For a sentence to be grammatically right, it needs three basic things: a subject, a verb, and an object. The subject is the main thing in the sentence; the verb shows what the subject does, and the object is what gets affected by the main thing. In this sentence: - The subject is the electrode (the main thing). - The verb is \\"was left\\" (what happened to the electrode). - The object is ions (who did something to the electrode). So, the sentence has everything it needs and should be okay for a linguist! However, the meaning might be a bit unclear to most people. It is pretty odd for ions to leave an electrode, so it's confusing for a five-year-old, and maybe even a grown-up.

Write an article with the title: \\"T-shirt proclaims ‘I’ll be damned…I’m a Republican!’\\" Article:","completion":"Title: T-shirt proclaims ‘I’ll be damned…I’m a Republican!’ Introduction In a world where political affiliations are at the forefront of discussions and debates, a simple T-shirt is making waves and garnering attention for its proud yet amusing proclamation: \\"I'll be damned...I'm a Republican!\\" This statement, printed boldly across the chest, encapsulates the sentiments of many GOP supporters who are unapologetic and confident in their beliefs, despite the growing criticisms and misconceptions thrown their way. This article delves into the origin of this unique attire, the message it sends, and its significance in today's political climate. A Trend-setting T-shirt The T-shirt, which has become a source of conversation, was designed by an ambitious entrepreneur who wanted to create a product that would spark conversations and encourage people to wear their political affiliations with pride. Jeff Mullins, the creative mind behind the T-shirt, initially had a limited production run of the shirts to test the waters. However, the tremendous response and popularity among Republicans prompted Mullins to scale up production and establish an online store. A Message Loud and Clear The slogan \\"I'll be damned...I'm a Republican!\\" boldly proclaims its message - the wearer is a proud Republican who is unafraid to show off their political allegiances. It encapsulates a sense of defiance and strength in the face of adversity and criticism, perpetuating the idea that it is possible to maintain one's convictions despite societal pressures. In essence, this T-shirt signifies that the wearer will stand firm in their beliefs and principles. Breaking Stereotypes An important aspect of the T-shirt's message is its potential to break stereotypes. With growing misconceptions and misrepresentations about Republicans and their policies, this T-shirt acts as a statement against the generalizations often placed upon GOP supporters. Users of the shirt emphasize that being a Republican is not a monolithic identity but rather a diverse group of people who share common values and principles. The Role of Humor The tongue-in-cheek humor of the T-shirt also plays a significant role in its popularity. In an era of heated political debates, it is refreshing to see that some lightheartedness and wit can still be injected into political discussions. This humor is an effective strategy that enables Republicans to reaffirm their political beliefs while simultaneously disarming their critics, allowing for more open discussions. Uniting the Party In a time when the Republican Party and its supporters are often viewed as fragmented, the T-shirt serves as a rallying call for unity among party members. By wearing a T-shirt with this slogan, supporters can unite under a common banner, fostering a sense of solidarity and camaraderie. This is crucial considering the importance of unity within political parties, particularly in times of elections or legislative battles. The Other Side of the Coin While many Republicans may find these T-shirts appealing, it is crucial to note that others may perceive them as divisive instruments that perpetuate political polarization. Critics argue that by flaunting a politically charged T-shirt, wearers may inadvertently alienate others with differing opinions and contribute to the 'us versus them' mindset. Conclusion The T-shirt proclaiming \\"I'll be damned...I'm a Republican!\\" has risen to prominence, becoming a symbol of defiance, pride, and unity among many Republicans. The confident, unapologetic message encapsulates the sentiments of GOP supporters who are proud of their beliefs and unafraid to face adversity. In today's politically charged environment, this T-shirt serves as a reminder that political affiliations can be worn with pride, humor, and conviction. However, it is essential to recognize that while it may resonate with many, it might alienate others, emphasizing the importance of respectful dialogue and understanding in fostering a healthy political climate."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Premise: \\"But you will not do it again.\\" There was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he did not turn his head.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The faint sound quickly drew his attention, he wouldn't let his guard down this time.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"But you will not do it again. There was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he did not turn his head\\" suggests that the character at that moment is so engrossed in their accomplishment that they are unable to acknowledge or react to the faint sound behind them. The character might have become complacent or overconfident, which led to their inattention to their surroundings. Now, let's examine the hypothesis \\"The faint sound quickly drew his attention, he wouldn't let his guard down this time.\\" This hypothesis contradicts the given premise as it implies that the character is alert and mindful of their surroundings, being aware of any unusual sounds or occurrences. It suggests that the character might have learned from their past experiences and is now prioritizing vigilance over reveling in their recent achievements. If we evaluate these two statements—premise and hypothesis—and try to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first clarify the concept of entailment. In logic and reasoning, entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). In other words, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well; conversely, if the hypothesis is false, then the premise must be false. In the context of the provided statements, given that the premise suggests the character's disregard for the faint sound and their focus on their success, it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, which assumes the character's heightened sense of awareness and reluctance to lower their guard. Considering this, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis may lie in the character's growth or development over time. While the premise might describe a specific instance of the character's failure to recognize potential dangers due to their preoccupation with success, the hypothesis could signify a later point in time where the character has matured and become more cautious, realizing the importance of staying vigilant. In summary, the given premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they describe contrasting character traits and behaviors. The premise illustrates a moment of inattention due to a focus on success, while the hypothesis portrays a cautious and alert character, having learned from previous experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following passage \\"Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation.

Sentence 1: \\"Every baby superstore features a section that could be called the Wall of Death.\\" In this sentence, the primary subject discussed is \\"every baby superstore,\\" which is a specific type of superstore that focuses on baby products. The sentence claims that within these baby superstores, there is a section that could be called \\"the Wall of Death.\\" This statement implies that there is an aspect or section within these baby superstores that might have a negative or dangerous connotation. Sentence 2: \\"Every superstore features a section that could be called Wall of Death.\\" In the second sentence, the subject of focus is broader, addressing \\"every superstore\\" rather than just baby superstores.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

Help as much as you can. New Year’s resolutions are great, unless you don’t really resolve to do anything. Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two.

Out of fear, Oskar never fights back. In the evenings, however, he sits in the courtyard rehearsing knife attacks on his tormentors. One evening, Oskar notices a new girl about his age and her father moving into into #15, the apartment next door to his. Oddly, the first thing they do is to cover the windows with cardboard. What Oskar doesn't know is that Håkan(Per Ragnar) is not Eli (Lina Leandersson)'s father... he is her renfield... and Eli is a vampire. It is Håkan's job to bring Eli fresh blood, which he gets by killing other humans. First he anesthetizes them with halothane, then he strings them up by the feet, slits their necks, and catches the blood in a jug, leaving the bodies to be discovered the next day. Unfortunately for Eli, Håkan is having problems securing blood for her. On his first kill after moving into the new apartment, he either lost or forgot the jug filled with blood. Consequently, Eli is beginning to get hungry.One evening, as Oskar is in the courtyard stabbing a tree in lieu of his tormentors, he notices Eli watching him. She's not very friendly, as she tells him right off that she can't be friends with him. The next evening, they run into each other again in the courtyard. Oskar notices that Eli is not wearing a coat even though it's the dead of winter in Stockholm. What's more, she's not even cold. And she smells bad. Still, Oskar shares with her his Rubik's cube and shows her how to work it. After Oskar has gone inside, Eli goes hunting. She waits in the shadows under a bridge.

Possible A: apartment, living room, bedroom, kitchen, cabinet Why is \\"cabinet\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Cabinet\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for storing and hiding a television due to several reasons. While the other options provided, such as apartment, living room, bedroom, and kitchen, are all locations where a television can be placed or used, they do not necessarily offer a means to store or hide the television effectively. Here are a few factors that make \\"cabinet\\" a more suitable and practical option: 1. Concealment: A cabinet typically has doors, drawers, or other means of covering its contents, which allows a television to be effectively hidden when it is not in use. This concealment can be highly desirable for maintaining a streamlined appearance in a room or for keeping the television out of sight when guests visit. 2. Safety and Protection: Storing a television inside a cabinet can provide it with additional protection from accidental bumps, knocks, or spills. It can also protect the television from exposure to dust, which could otherwise accumulate on the screen and internal components if the television was left out in the open. 3. Organization: A cabinet allows for additional organization and storage of related items, such as remote controls, media players, gaming consoles, and cables. This can help to keep the television area neat and tidy, without the clutter associated with various entertainment devices and accessories. 4. Aesthetic Appeal: Some people prefer to have their television hidden away in a cabinet in order to maintain a particular interior design style or to prevent the television from becoming the visual focal point of the room. In such cases, a well-designed cabinet can blend seamlessly with the rest of the furnishings, keeping the television out of sight until it is needed. 5. Space-saving: For individuals with limited living space, a cabinet can serve as an excellent space-saving solution for storing and hiding a television. Cabinets can be designed to fit into corners, recessed wall spaces, or to act as room dividers, which can help to make the most of the available space. In conclusion, \\"cabinet\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense for storing and hiding a television due to factors such as concealment, safety and protection, organization, aesthetic appeal, and space-saving capabilities. This option provides a practical and versatile means to keep a television hidden away while still allowing easy access when needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the context: What will happen to Others? Answer:","completion":"Understanding the situation: Given that Tracy constantly teases other people due to her belief that they do not like her, it is important to consider the consequences for those who are subjected to her teasing and the overall relationship dynamics within their social circle. Given this context, there could be a multitude of potential outcomes for the others involved: 1. Emotional and psychological impact: One potential outcome for others subjected to Tracy's teasing is a lasting emotional and psychological impact. Experiencing teasing and bullying can lead to several issues such as lowered self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and even post-traumatic stress disorder. The victims might start to doubt themselves, feel self-conscious, and become overly critical of their appearance, behavior, or abilities. 2. Social isolation: As a result of Tracy's teasing, those targeted may gradually isolate themselves and withdraw from social events or gatherings. They might find it difficult to trust others or form meaningful relationships, leading to loneliness and diminished emotional support. 3. Development of coping mechanisms: Over time, those exposed to consistent teasing may develop various coping mechanisms to handle the situation. Some may try to befriend Tracy in order to avoid being teased, while others might develop a thick skin and ignore it. Alternatively, some may become assertive and confront Tracy about her behavior, or become passive-aggressive in dealing with the situation. 4. Escalation of conflict: If the teasing continues, tensions might escalate, leading to open hostility and verbal or even physical altercations. Friends or family members of the targeted individuals might also become involved, taking sides, and intensifying the conflict. 5. Strained relationships: As a result of the entire situation, relationships within the social circle could be strained. Individuals might have varying opinions of how to handle Tracy's behavior, which could create division and animosity within the group. This, in turn, might lead to the breakdown of friendships and the deterioration of the overall sense of camaraderie. 6. Intervention by a third party: Depending on the severity of the situation, friends, family members, or authority figures might be compelled to intervene. This intervention could involve mediation to resolve conflicts or even the involvement of mental health professionals to address the underlying emotional and psychological issues that Tracy and her victims might be facing. 7. Personal growth and change: In some cases, such challenging situations can be the catalyst for personal growth and change. Both Tracy and the individuals she teases might learn valuable lessons about empathy, self-awareness, and conflict resolution. These transformative experiences might prove valuable in promoting personal development and fostering healthier interpersonal dynamics in the long run. In conclusion, the impact of Tracy's teasing on others can vary widely and depend on various factors such as individual personalities, coping mechanisms, and the overall dynamics within their social circle. The outcomes could range from emotional and psychological distress to strained relationships or even intervention by third parties. However, there is also the possibility that such trying circumstances could lead to personal growth and the development of healthier and more empathetic interpersonal relationships."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What is the best way to: How to insert plastic triangles into brass rod.","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's say you want to put a small plastic triangle inside a metal stick called a brass rod. Here's an easy way to do it: 1. First, make sure the plastic triangle is small enough to fit inside the brass rod. You can use a ruler to measure the size of the triangle and the opening of the brass rod. 2. Now, if you find the plastic triangle a bit too big, ask an adult to help you make it smaller. They can use a tool like sandpaper to gently rub the edges of the triangle until it becomes the right size. 3. Once the triangle is the right size, we can place it inside the brass rod. Hold the rod horizontally, and let the opening face up so it looks like a slide. 4. Place the plastic triangle on the opening of the brass rod. Then, using your finger or a small tool like a pencil, gently push the triangle into the rod. 5. You might need to wiggle or twist the triangle a little bit to help it slide in smoothly. Be patient, and keep trying until the triangle is all the way inside the brass rod. 6. Congratulations, buddy! You've successfully inserted a plastic triangle into a brass rod!"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

The article is about Pope John Paul's visit to Lourdes, which involves a religious aspect, thus making it a potential candidate for the 'World' category. Furthermore, the article discusses the financial deficit that resulted from this visit, specifically mentioning a 1.2 million euro deficit.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you keep a lot of music on your iPad, its likely taking up a sizable chunk of your storage space. iTunes Match is a paid service from Apple that allows you to stream your entire iTunes library to your iPad (or any other Apple device or computer). This can free up tons of space, as you'll no longer need to keep any music files stored on your iPad. Click here for instructions on setting it up. There are some drawbacks to the service. Besides costing 25 per year, you'll only be able to stream when you have a network location. You can always download any of your songs to your iPad ahead of time if you're anticipating being without a network connection. iTunes Match allows you to upload songs that you didn't purchase through the iTunes Store. You can also use services like Google Play Music to upload and stream your music. If you opt for a streaming service, or make the switch to internet radio, you can delete all of the music files from your iPad at once. Any purchased music will still be downloadable from the iTunes Store. Open the Settings app. Tap \\"General\\" and then select \\"Usage\\". Tap \\"Manage Storage\\" in the \\"Storage\\" section. Tap the Music app. You may have to wait a few moments for it to appear. If your Music app isn't listed, you don't have any music files actually stored on the iPad. Tap the \\"Edit\\" button. Tap the \\"-\\" next to \\"All Songs\\" and then tap \\"Delete\\". You can also delete individual songs this way. If you just want to delete certain songs, you can do so from within the Music app. Be aware that depending on your settings, songs may be visible that aren't actually stored on your iPad (iTunes purchases, iTunes Match songs, etc.). Open the Music app on your iPad. Find the song or album that you want to delete. Songs that are not downloaded to your iPad will have an iCloud icon on the right side of the song. Swipe the song or album to the left to reveal the \\"Delete\\" button. If you cannot swipe a song, it means that it is not downloaded to your iPad and therefore not taking up space. If you cannot swipe an album, it means that one or more songs on the album are not downloaded on your iPad. You'll need to delete individual songs from within the album. Tap \\"Delete\\". This will delete the song or album from your iPad. If you see the \\"Remove\\" button instead of the \\"Delete\\" button, it means you are in Playlist view. You must delete songs from the Songs, Albums, or Artists view. If you've downloaded movies, TV shows, or music videos from the iTunes Store, they could be taking up a lot of space. HD videos in particular can be huge. Removing videos after you watch them can make room for a bunch of other things. Open the Settings app on your iPad, select \\"General\\", and then \\"Usage\\". Tap \\"Manage Storage\\" in the \\"Storage\\" section. Select the Videos app. If you have a lot of videos downloaded, it will likely be one of the last apps to appear, and should be located towards the top of the list. Review your videos.

Mr Corbyn said: \\"What I've said is that if the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people want a referendum, they have the right to do that. \\"That was the whole point of the devolution agreement of the 1990s. \\"I think the referendum should take place, if there is to be one, after the Brexit negotiations are concluded because this is the most important thing.\\" Nicola Sturgeon has previously called for a second vote on Scotland's constitutional future between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. Launching the SNP's general election manifesto in Perth, Ms Sturgeon said opposition to an independence referendum would be \\"democratically unsustainable\\" if the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats. The manifesto includes a call for a vote on independence to be held \\"at the end of the Brexit process\\". This has been rejected by Theresa May, who insists \\"now is not the time\\" despite a majority in the Scottish Parliament favouring a referendum in principle.

However, he advises that such a decision should be put on hold until the UK has concluded its Brexit negotiations with the EU. His stance comes in response to Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), who believes a second referendum should be held once the final terms of the Brexit deal are known, but not at present. According to Sturgeon, opposition to a second referendum would be undemocratic if the SNP secures a majority of seats in Scotland. The SNP's election manifesto unveiled in Perth supports a vote on independence at the conclusion of Brexit negotiations. Contrary to these positions, the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May rejects a second referendum, even though the Scottish Parliament is, in principle, in favor of one. She has stated her belief that \\"now is not the time.\\" While discussing these issues during a visit to a nursery in Westminster, the Labour leader emphasized that the priority should be managing Brexit negotiations, especially achieving tariff-free trade access to the European market, as this is crucial for the UK's manufacturing industry. He also advocated for positive future agreements with Europe on topics such as sea management. The leader of the Labour Party iterated that, if the Scottish Parliament attempts to pass a motion for a second referendum before Brexit is complete, his party would urge them to delay it until after the Brexit talks. He believes that the pressing matters in Scotland pertain to issues like poverty, investment, and housing needs. If elected, he claims, a Labour government would prioritize helping the Scottish people in these areas. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have criticized the Labour leader's stance on Scottish independence as being confused and inconsistent.

It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk. This is the highlight. On this trip I got a large Greek Salad. I like the creamy type greek dressing.. it's atypical for Greek salad, but I'm into it. I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl.

This year's event was no exception, with a plethora of shining stars – and some not-so-shining performances – making appearances. In this article, we will discuss those who shined in the spotlight and others who had a tougher time winning over audiences as we delve into the cinematic spectacle that was Sundance 2022. Step 1: Highlight the standout performances This year's Sundance Film Festival introduced a diverse range of films, from powerful dramas to thought-provoking documentaries. One standout performance came from rising actress Skylar Johnson in the heart-wrenching coming-of-age tale \\"Emerald Waters.\\" Johnson's portrayal of a young woman grappling with her identity and place in the world was both vulnerable and captivating, earning her well-deserved accolades from critics and audiences. Step 2: Mention notable newcomers Sundance is known for launching the careers of unknown talents, and this year's festival was no different. One such newcomer, writer-director Karen Lee, made her mark with the striking debut feature \\"Fractured Memories.\\" Lee's film explored the complexities of family, love, and loss through a poignant and visually stunning narrative, garnering critical praise and a potential distribution deal with a major streaming service. Step 3: Bring attention to thought-provoking documentaries Documentaries played a significant role at this year's Sundance Film Festival, with many addressing pressing social issues and inspiring important conversations. \\"Bridges to Hope\\" by director Thomas Fournier was one such film, offering a raw and unflinching look at the lives of individuals struggling with addiction and their journey towards recovery. The documentary stirred emotions among viewers while highlighting the importance of treatment and compassion in overcoming addiction. Step 4: Discuss the less shining stars Despite the many triumphant successes, some films and performances at Sundance struggled to make a lasting impression. One such example was the ambitious sci-fi film \\"Eclipse,\\" which failed to resonate with audiences. The film's choppy storyline and underdeveloped characters left viewers wanting more, ultimately affecting its chances for a wider release. Step 5: Note trends in themes and styles This year's Sundance Film Festival showcased a shift towards more inclusive and diverse storytelling, with many films addressing timely issues such as race, gender, and environmental concerns. This shift in focus signifies a promising trend in the independent film industry, where the aim is to bring a variety of voices and perspectives to the forefront. Conclusion: The Sundance Film Festival has always been a platform for showcasing exceptional talent in the world of independent cinema. This year's festival highlighted many shining stars, from powerful performances to thought-provoking documentaries. While not every film left a lasting impression, the overall trend toward diverse and inclusive storytelling bodes well for the future of the industry. With all eyes on Sundance, we look forward to witnessing the rise of these shining, or not-so-shining, stars as they continue to shape the landscape of independent film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that Rose farm, which produced organic milk, likely had milk production practices that reduced leaching of phosphates in comparison to the Berry farm, which produced conventional milk. To elaborate further, it is important to understand the differences between conventional and organic farming practices. Conventional farming typically involves the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to enhance crop growth and protect against pests. On the other hand, organic farming relies on natural processes, such as nutrient recycling, biological pest control, and crop rotation, to maintain soil fertility and manage pests. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and it is commonly found in both organic and synthetic fertilizers. However, excessive phosphorus, mainly in the form of phosphates, can leach into nearby water bodies, contributing to water pollution and negatively affecting aquatic ecosystems. In conventional dairy farming, such as the practices at Berry farm, there is a higher likelihood of phosphate leaching due to the more frequent use of synthetic fertilizers containing high concentrations of phosphorus. The application of these fertilizers can easily result in an excess of phosphorus, which may then leach into nearby water bodies. Moreover, regular use of pesticides and herbicides can affect the beneficial microorganisms responsible for breaking down and retaining phosphates in the soil. Conversely, Rose farm, which produces organic milk, likely has practices in place that minimize the risk of phosphate leaching. Organic dairy farming focuses on sustainable farming practices that prioritize soil health and nutrient management. This often involves using organic or natural fertilizers, such as compost or manure, that can help to balance soil nutrients. Furthermore, organic practices, like cover cropping and crop rotation, promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the soil, which can assist in reducing the risk of nutrient leaching. Additionally, organic dairy farms typically emphasize pasture-based systems, and grazing livestock can often help to recycle nutrients back into the soil, thus reducing the need for external phosphorus inputs. As a result, this holistic and sustainable approach to farming makes it more likely that Rose farm had milk production practices that reduced the leaching of phosphates in comparison to the conventional methods employed by Berry farm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Orlando Health and Florida Hospital will not bill survivors of the Pulse nightclub massacre for out-of-pocket medical expenses, officials announced Wednesday. Instead, the hospitals will write off an estimated 5.5 million or more in care. \\"The pulse shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims, their families and our entire community,\\" Orlando Health President and CEO David Strong said. \\"During this very trying time, many organizations, individuals and charities have reached out to Orlando Health to show their support. This is simply our way of paying that kindness forward.\\" Its main hospital — Orlando Regional Medical Center — treated 44 of the more than 50 victims who needed immediate medical attention from the June 12 attack that killed 49 people. The nightclub is only a couple of blocks from the Level 1 trauma center. Nine of the Pulse patients died shortly after arriving at ORMC, and their families also will not be charged, hospital officials said. One victim remains hospitalized there. At Orlando Health, bills will be sent to health insurers for patients who had coverage, but whatever those policies don't cover will be absorbed by the hospital chain, said spokeswoman Kena Lewis. At Florida Hospital, which treated a dozen of the clubgoers, officials said they would not even bill the victims' insurance for the treatment, nor will they bill for follow-up surgeries the survivors may need. \\"It was incredible to see how our community came together in the wake of the senseless Pulse shooting,\\" said Daryl Tol, Florida Hospital's president and CEO. \\"We hope this gesture can add to the heart and goodwill that defines Orlando.\\" Survivors welcomed the news. \\"I was so worried because I can't afford any of that,\\" said Mario Lopez, 34, who was visiting from Miami when he went to the club after a friend's housewarming party. (Naseem S. Miller) \\"I just went out for a fun night with friends. No one expected this to happen. My life was turned upside down, and then I had to worry about how I was going to pay back the hospital.\\" Lopez, who is uninsured, was grazed by a bullet and had fragments explode into his left side. After he was hit, he fell and split his elbow on a shard of glass. His seven-hour hospital visit left him with a new nightmare: a potential 20,000-bill. \\"It's a huge relief\\" to know he won't have to pay, he said. At Orlando Health, Lewis said the hospital would work with victims who will need future surgeries as a result of the shootings. \\"We can't predict the future needs of these patients, their financial situations or what the state or federal governments may require us to do for charity policies,\\" she said. \\"While we can't assume the answer is free care forever, we will use our very generous charity and financial assistance policies to assess the best way\\" to help. As it is, the hospital chain is expecting to shoulder at least 5 million in unreimbursed care for the Pulse victims, many of whom had extensive injuries, Lewis said. Florida Hospital officials said the bills there totaled more than 525,000. As for Lopez, his physical wounds are healing, he said, but the emotional trauma still feels raw at times. \\"It's tough,\\" he said. \\"Each day, I have my moments.\\" ksantich@orlandosentinel.com, @katesantich, 407-420-5503 chayes@orlandosentinel.com, @Journo_Christal, 407-420-5493 ||||| The Costs Of The Pulse Nightclub Shooting Enlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP Mario Perez lives in Miami, but he was in Orlando for a housewarming party Saturday, June 11. After the party, the 34-year-old went to the Pulse nightclub for Latin night. At 2 a.m., he heard gunshots. Loud. He knew it was real. \\"And the minute he started shooting, I got hit from the side, I got grazed by a bullet,\\" Perez says. \\"My first instinct was to fall to the floor, that's what you're taught to do.\\" He heard gunshot after gunshot after gunshot — too many to count. But then there was a brief break in the firing, and Perez ran out the back of the club. He hid inside the kitchen of a nearby 7-Eleven until police and paramedics showed up. He was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, and was at the emergency room from 3 a.m. until 8 a.m. The gunshot wound on his side is purple and swollen, and he has nerve damage from the bullet fragment. He cut his elbow from glass on the floor of the nightclub and needed six stitches. Perez doesn't know how much bills coming from specialists, X-rays and tests might cost him. But his bill from Orlando Regional Medical Center's emergency department is 20,000. \\"20,000,\\" Perez said. \\"That's the quote, that's what they told me.\\" Perez has no health insurance. He's working for a temp agency right now and doesn't have the money to be seen by a doctor for follow-up care in Miami. So just how much will the Pulse nightclub shooting cost all of the victims? It's a difficult, if not impossible question to answer right now. At last check, 56 people had been brought to the hospital, including three patients who spent two weeks in the intensive care unit, and one patient who is still in the hospital in critical condition. Embry Howell, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., studied the average cost of a gunshot victim in 2010. Using that benchmark, she estimates the hospital costs from the Pulse shooting will be about 1 million. \\"And I would imagine that would be an underestimate,\\" Howell said. Howell said many of the victims may be in the same boat as Mario Perez: uninsured. \\"They're young, primarily Latino and living in Florida,\\" she says, a state that has not expanded Medicaid to its population. \\"My guess would be you have a high rate of uninsured,\\" she concludes. Ted Miller, a researcher with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, has been studying the cost of firearm injuries for more than two decades. He used the 2011 shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and 18 others in Arizona to make what he calls a conservative estimate: 4 to 7 million in medical costs and mental health costs for victims and survivors of people who died. That's lifetime medical costs for the survivors, the costs of surgery and rehab — but it doesn't count long-term costs for those who are severely injured. \\"They said some time ago that there were six people in ICU who would have longtime, serious consequences,\\" Miller said. \\"And my guess is most of those folks will have traumatic brain injuries that will have continuing lifetime care.\\" Miller also makes a broader estimate beyond just the medical costs. That includes the cost of the police response, the cost to employers — and the dollar value of those 49 lost lives. \\"I estimate that the total cost of the Orlando shooting is around 385 to 390 million,\\" Miller says. \\"To put that in context, on that same day, the cost of other gunshot wounds in the U.S. was probably about 600 million. So about 1 1/2 times the cost of the Orlando incident. That tells you that there are a lot of people killed and injured by firearms every day in this country,\\" he says. And, he explains, \\"Suicide deaths account for the largest share of gun violence costs.\\" Miller's 385 million estimate doesn't include the cost of mental health counseling for people who were in the club but not physically shot — and friends and family of those there. And then there's the cost of fear: people being afraid to go out to a dance club, or maybe skipping a visit to the theme parks. Orlando Regional received 44 of the shooting victims. A hospital spokeswoman says some patients have insurance coverage, some don't. The hospital is going to look for payment sources from the community or the state, such as victim funds that are raising money across the country. But she says the hospital expects unreimbursed costs of more than 5 million. Pulse shooting victim Mario Perez is calculating his personal costs. He's worried he's going to lose his job. He's anxious knowing millions of dollars have been raised to help victims, but his bills are arriving now. He started his own GoFundMe campaign, but it's only raised about 600. \\"As long as it gets covered, I'm going to be fine,\\" Perez said. \\"If they don't cover it, I'm stuck in a hole. I don't know what I'm going to be able to do if they don't assist me.\\" This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Health News Florida and Kaiser Health News. |||||","completion":"Orlando Health and Florida Hospital will not charge the survivors of the Pulse nightclub shooting for their medical expenses and will instead write off an estimated 5.5 million or more in care costs.

As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. To me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

In logical reasoning and argument construction, a hypothesis is considered to be entailed by a premise if it can be logically deduced or inferred from the given premise. It means the truth of the hypothesis is absolutely guaranteed by the truth of the premise. The premise given here is \\"The warlocks leaped back under the roof.\\" From this sentence, we understand that certain characters — warlocks, who are male practitioners of magic — moved in a certain way (leaping back) and in a certain location (under the roof). On the other hand, the hypothesis — \\"The witches jumped into the pool.\\" — involves entirely different characters (witches: typically female practitioners of magic), different action (jumping) and different location (into a pool). There is no logical connection or overlap between the premise and the hypothesis, with regard to character identities, actions and locations. The characters are not the same: warlocks are not witches; the actions are not the same: leaping is not the same as jumping; and the locations are different: under a roof is not the same as into a pool. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced or inferred from the premise. Additionally, the premise does not include any information about witches, pools, or the act of jumping. Therefore, the hypothesis adds new information which wasn't presented or suggested in any way by the premise.

Answer:","completion":"In order to please an old Western woman, you can say to her, \\"You look so young and beautiful.\\" This statement compliments her appearance and does not focus on her age, which, as the article suggests, is a sensitive topic for many women, especially elderly ones. Moreover, this approach aligns with the cultural practice of celebrating women's \\"birthday\\" as the 39th, 29th, or 19th to maintain a perception of youthfulness. By emphasizing the woman's youthful appearance, you show respect and consideration for her feelings and cultural norms, while avoiding potentially uncomfortable or impolite questions about her actual age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no","completion":"To analyze this multi-choice question, let's examine the two sentences: - Sentence 1: They knew enough of you both for that. - Sentence 2: They knew the things you've done with each other. Let's break down the meaning of each sentence and determine if they are related. Sentence 1 indicates that \\"they\\" have a certain level of knowledge about \\"you both\\" that seems to be sufficient for some purpose (which is not specified in the question). Sentence 2 suggests that \\"they\\" are aware of specific actions or experiences that \\"you both\\" have participated in together. Based on these analyses, I can conclude that: 1. If Sentence 1 is true, then \\"they\\" have enough knowledge about \\"you both\\". 2.

Here are possible answers to this question: - book - internet - manual - library - manual I believe the correct choice is \\"internet\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The fairly new way to access information among the given choices is indeed the \\"internet\\". Let me explain in detail why this is the correct choice: The internet has revolutionized the way we access information, unlike traditional methods such as books, manuals, and libraries. While they have been around for centuries, the internet has only become widely popular over the past few decades. This rapid growth has made the internet a primary source of information for many people around the world. Here are several reasons why the internet is a fairly new and effective way to access information: 1. Ease of Access: The internet provides instantaneous access to a vast amount of information on any topic you can think of. Simply type a query into a search engine, and within seconds, you'll have thousands of webpages filled with relevant information. This is a huge advantage compared to manually searching through books or visiting libraries. 2. Up-to-date Information: Traditional information sources, like books and manuals, may quickly become outdated. On the other hand, information on the internet is regularly updated, ensuring that users have access to the most current data available. This is particularly useful for topics that evolve rapidly, such as technology or science. 3. Multimedia Content: The internet allows users to access various multimedia content, which contributes to a richer learning experience. From videos and podcasts to interactive websites and social media, the internet offers a wide range of formats to consume information, catering to different preferences and learning styles. 4. Accessibility: With the development of smartphones, tablets, and laptops, people can connect to the internet and access information from anywhere in the world, anytime. In addition, people with disabilities can utilize adaptive technologies, enabling them to access the internet and diverse information with greater ease. 5. Collaboration and Sharing: The internet enables users to collaborate and share information at a global scale. Platforms like discussion forums, social media, and blogs encourage the exchange of ideas and facilitate learning. This continuous sharing of knowledge fosters the growth of collective wisdom. 6. Customization and Personalization: The internet allows users to filter and tailor the information they access according to their specific needs and interests. This personalization makes it easier to find relevant information in a shorter amount of time. In conclusion, the relatively recent rise of the internet has created a whole new approach to accessing information. Its ease of use, up-to-date content, multimedia formats, accessibility, global collaboration, and personalization make it the most efficient and effective way of acquiring information compared to traditional methods like books, manuals, and libraries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Don’t go into the relationship expecting immediate commitment. Instead, take your time getting to know your partner and bonding with her. Dating after spousal loss is an intimidating process, so your significant other may have reservations about taking this step in the first place. Many people date with the intention of creating a long-term relationship, widows included. Be sure to talk with your partner about what you both are looking for in a relationship. If you both want a committed, stable relationship, feel free to proceed with each other. However, if you find you want different outcomes, it may be better to part ways. To start this conversation, you could ask: “Can we talk about where we see this relationship going?” or “Can we talk about whether we're interested in having a committed relationship?” Your partner’s status as a widow does not have to define your relationship, despite its understandable impact. You can strengthen your relationship with your significant other by trying new things together. This won’t erase your partner’s memories of her deceased spouse; instead it will help her to look forward to a future with you. The two of you could go out to your favorite restaurant or pick up a new hobby together. Even small moments, such as cooking a meal together or sharing a joke, can go a long way in strengthening your bond. Dating a widow may present new and unexpected challenges for the relationship. You may start to feel uneasy hearing about your significant other’s late partner and measure yourself against them. Your partner may worry about losing you just as she lost her spouse before you. Communicate with each other about your feelings, so you can work through them together. One helpful way to start this conversation would be: “I feel uncomfortable when you compare my new haircut to how Phil wore his hair. It's important to me that you see me for myself.” Be sure to place emphasis on how a specific behavior makes you feel; this gets to the heart of the issue. Let them adjust to you at their own pace. Children may feel easily threatened by the idea of a new stepparent. They may gain the impression that you are trying to take over their late parent’s role. Introduce yourself to them, but don’t try to join in on family activities right away. Your partner’s children will need to gradually get used to your presence. Follow your partner’s lead. She knows her children best. Talk with her about how to comfortably get to know her children and try to learn about their personalities and interests. It may be best to start off by coming over for dinner one night, or accompanying your partner and her children to one of their extracurricular activities. Participating in more casual activities will help to ease some of the tension.

Movie plot: Cliff Spab (Stephen Dorff) and his friend Joe Dice (Jack Noseworthy) are two slackers who go out one evening to buy some beer in a Los Angeles convenience store. While there, a group of masked and heavily armed terrorists take Cliff, Joe, and three other people hostage. The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.T. Image, have a video camera, and they tape their hostages. During the month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised on worldwide television live and uncut, or else the hostages will be killed. After two of the hostages are killed, Cliff, Joe and another hostage, a young teenage girl named Wendy Pfister (Reese Witherspoon), are the only ones left. After 36 days, Cliff become indifferent to being killed, and he says repeatedly, \\"So fucking what?\\", in reply to his captors' threats to kill him. Because of the coverage, this makes Cliff a media icon.The movie skips forward, picking up in the hospital. Cliff, we learn, had shot his way to freedom, at the cost of a bullet in his shoulder, and more significantly, Joe's life. Despite Joe's death, Cliff is branded a hero for saving Wendy and killing all the terrorists. He's picked up from the hospital by his brother Scott (David Barry Gray) and taken home, where Cliff soon becomes uncomfortable. He does not appreciate either the reporters camped outside his front lawn, nor his parents, who welcome him home awkwardly. Cliff cannot stand the presence of his domineering father and weak-willed mother, and he flees their house. But on the street, he finds that his life cannot go back to what it was before the convenience store. His line, abbreviated as S.F.W., is on banners, newspapers, CDs, and on billboard advertisements. At the fast food restaurant where he works, called Burger Boy, he finds his name and image on the board with a \\"Special 36¢ Cliff Spab Burger\\" being marketed in commemoration of his 36 days in captivity.Cliff flees to the home of Joe's older sister Monica (Joey Lauren Adams), who tells... My question: WHAT DOES CLIFF ASPIRE ? A:","completion":"Cliff aspires to find a sense of normalcy, genuine connection, and escape from the unwanted fame and attention that has been thrust upon him after the hostage situation. Throughout the progression of the movie, we see that Cliff is overwhelmed by the media circus and constant reminders of his traumatic experience. His iconic line, \\"So fucking what?\\" (S.F.W.), speaks to his indifference towards the terrorists' threats and his attempt to diminish their power over him. However, as Cliff struggles with the aftermath of the hostage situation, he realizes that the media and society have taken his statement and turned it into a symbol that no longer represents his true intent. This disillusionment drives him to seek refuge away from the spotlight and to find meaningful relationships with those who understand his plight, such as the sister of his deceased friend Joe, Monica. In essence, Cliff aspires to regain control over his life and move past the tragedy that has come to define him. He hopes to find solace in reconnecting with those close to him before the incident and to break free from the media's portrayal of him as a superficial hero.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"?

Analyze the content of the review. The review is quite short and only consists of two elements: \\"I.like\\" and \\"Oooo\\". The first part (\\"I.like\\") indicates a positive sentiment, while the second part (\\"Oooo\\") is unclear and does not clearly convey any positive or negative sentiment. 2. Make assumptions. Since the review contains a positive sentiment (\\"I.like\\"), I will assume that the reviewer liked whatever they are referring to in the review. As for \\"Oooo\\", it is unclear whether this is a typo, a name, or simply an expression, so it's hard to determine its significance in the review. 3. Determine the star-rating. Given the assumptions and the presence of a positive sentiment, I will lean towards a higher star-rating. However, the review is lacking in specific details, making it difficult to confidently assign a higher rating, such as 4 or 5 stars.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Google to Buy Motorola Mobility for 12.5 Billion In a bid to strengthen its mobile business, Google announced on Monday that it would acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings, the cellphone business that was split from Motorola, for 40 a share in cash, or 12.5 billion. The offer — by far Google’s largest ever for an acquisition — is 63 percent above the closing price of Motorola Mobility shares on Friday. Motorola manufactures phones that run on Google’s Android software. Android has become an increasingly important platform for Google, as global smartphone adoption accelerates. The platform, launched in 2007, is now used in more than 150 million devices, with 39 manufacturers. The acquisition would turn Google, which makes the Android mobile operating system, into a full-fledged cellphone manufacturer, in direct competition with Apple. “This is an emphatic exclamation point that Google is a mobile company,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Capital. “This is clearly a defensive deal, they were backed in a corner and they had to protect the Android platform.” The deal answers a big question about Google’s next strategic step in wireless. Google has been battling with Apple and Microsoft over patents. Last month, Apple and Microsoft led a consortium of technology companies in a 4.5 billion purchase of roughly 6,000 patents from Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Google, which lost out in the bidding, criticized the deal as an anticompetitive strategy. Several weeks later, Google acquired more than 1,000 patents from I.B.M. Motorola holds more than 17,000 patents. While the acquisition will move Google directly into the telecommunications hardware business, Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, said in a blog post that “this acquisition will not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform. Motorola will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. We will run Motorola as a separate business.” Still, the deal is certain to attract significant antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission is already investigating Google’s dominance in several areas of its business. The company has agreed to pay a 2.5 billion reverse termination fee, if it walks away, and Motorola will pay a 375 million break-up fee if it takes another offer, according to a person close to the transaction, who was not authorized to speak. In a conference call on Monday morning, Google said it was confident that it will be able to win regulatory approval, since the deal will ultimately improve competition in the smart phone market. “We think this is a competitive transaction,” David Drummond, the company’s chief legal officer said. “This is not a horizontal transaction, Google has not materially been in the handset business.” The acquisition of a major handset maker may still pose a significant challenge to the search giant, which has not specialized in manufacturing or marketing of smartphones. Last year, it closed down the online store for its first Google-branded phone, the Nexus One, citing the store’s underwhelming performance. A Motorola tie-up may also irk other phone manufacturers, like Samsung and HTC, which will now be competing directly with Google. “Can they convince their competitors that Motorola will truly operate as a standalone business?” Mr. Schachter said. And while Google has made dozens of acquisitions in recent years, most of them have been for less than 1 billion — despite a current war chest of some 40 billion in cash. On the company’s official blog, Mr. Page said Google was purchasing the handset maker to bolster its Android mobile operating system and increase the number of patents it owned. Android accounted for 43.4 percent of smartphone sales in the second quarter, according to Gartner Research, a major increase from the year ago period, when it made up about 17 percent of sales. “Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google’s patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anticompetitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies,” Mr. Page said. Carl C. Icahn, Motorola Mobility’s second-largest shareholder, had urged the company last month to “explore alternatives regarding its patent portfolio to enhance shareholder value.” Mr. Icahn owns 9.03 percent of Motorola Mobility. On Monday, he applauded the transaction, calling it “a great outcome for all shareholders of Motorola Mobility, especially in light of today’s markets.” Lazard and the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton advised Google. Frank Quattrone’s investment bank, Qatalyst Partners, Centerview Partners and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Motorola Mobility. The acquisition has been approved by both boards. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

Eliaquim Mangala has spoken of the difficulty he had staying fit while waiting for his £31.9million move to Manchester City to go through. City made Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football on Monday after finally agreeing terms with FC Porto and an investment company who owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. The 23-year-old agreed personal terms and passed a medical on a visit to Manchester last month, but has been training on his own since returning from the World Cup and a brief holiday while he waited for his future to be resolved. VIDEO Scroll down to see Eliaquim Mangala score with cheeky back heel volley. Chuffed: Eliaquim Mangala poses with a Man City shirt following his move to the Etihad Stadium. Patient: He has admitted that it was hard to stay fit as he waited for the move to go through. ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure,’ said Mangala in his first interview with City’s club website. ‘I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time in order to be 100 per cent but it is normal – it is like those who returned to training last week, but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible. ‘I am really very happy to be part of the team and I will work hard because we have lots of goals and it is very important to start to work as soon as possible.’ Mangala is determined to add to his medal collection in Manchester after winning league titles in Portugal and Belgium with Porto and Standard Liege. And he promised City fans that he will bring a winning mentality to Manuel Pellegrini’s team. Pricey: He became the most expensive defender in British football history following move from Porto. Acquisition: The defender played for Porto for three seasons before signing for Manuel Pellegrini. ‘When I am on the pitch, I always give everything from the first to the last minute,’ he added. ‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win. I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season. ‘I am quite a fast defender. I am good in challenges, good in the air. I have the ability to score goals and have done so in the past few seasons. I won’t score 10 goals-a-season but for a defender I get my share from set-pieces. ‘I am motivated because to be part of a team like City I have already proved that I have a certain value, but I will not stop trying to improve. ‘To be part of a squad is good but like everybody else I want to play and it will be down to the manager to make his choice. I will work hard to try to have a spot in the starting XI but the most important is that the team win the games, win titles. It is my main goal: work in order to help the team to win as many titles as possible.’ Manchester United and Chelsea were also linked with Mangala but the France World Cup defender admits that he was impressed by City’s success in recent years and the fact that they made the most effort to bring him to English football. ‘City is a big team in England and they proved it again this year by winning the title,’ he said. ‘Then it is the team that showed me the most interest. I had the opportunity to talk with the manager and the football director and it is also important to have some guarantees when you move to a new club. I had this opportunity to talk and I liked what they said so I signed with City. ‘The squad is great so it will allow me to progress again. I am also someone who likes to win titles and I know that with the squad we have we can do great things.’ Partner: Mangala is set to form a central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany. Follow on: He will join former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined the club earlier in the summer. Challenge: And he will be fighting for his place against Martin Demichelis. Mangala is expected to form a first-choice central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany but he will face competition from Martin Demichelis. Pellegrini also has Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik at his disposal, although Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards are expected to move on. ‘Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis are two players who possess great experience,’ said Mangala. ‘Vincent is the captain of Manchester City and the Belgium national team, Demichelis has enjoyed a great career. He played for Bayern Munich and he is now at Manchester City and has a big experience behind him. ‘They are players that I can look at and from whom I will learn a lot. They will have lots of advice for me regarding what they have already experienced. It will help me to progress and I am sure that everything will be fine. They are players that have lived through a lot of big moments and have a big experience so it can only be beneficial for me.’ Mangala joins his former Porto teammate Fernando at the Etihad after the Brazilian midfielder moved for £12m earlier this summer. He also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He added: ‘I was with Bacary Sagna during the World Cup so we had the opportunity to talk. There are quite a lot of French players and Fernando, who I was in touch during all the preparation because I came here earlier. ‘I had the chance to talk with him and there are some players that speak Spanish and I understand a bit of that language so I think it will be quite quick for me to settle in. The most important thing is to have a good understanding on the pitch and to all go in the same direction.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Eliaquim Mangala, a French professional footballer, has discussed the challenges he faced in staying fit while waiting for his £31.9 million move to Manchester City to be finalized.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Now, I have a new situation: Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel had almost no traces of AM fungi. Answer this question please: Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse in areas with higher soil nutrient concentrations. This is because Plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi under such conditions, and the fungi themselves reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae, indicating a cost/benefit balance within the plant-fungus symbiosis. Moving on to the new situation, we have two parcels of farmland. The Northern one has plenty of AM fungi, while the Southern one has almost none. Based on the inverse correlation between the presence of AM fungi and soil nutrient concentrations, it is likely that the Southern parcel of farmland which contains few or no AM fungi would have a higher soil nutrient content. The hypothesis that can be extended from this situation is that because the Southern parcel of land is richer in nutrients, plants growing there require less assistance from AM fungi to acquire nutrients. Thus, the plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi which possibly results in their decreased prevalence in the soil. However, it should be noted that this is a tentative conclusion because other factors may also influence the presence or absence of AM fungi. For example, certain pedoclimatic conditions, such as moisture levels and pH, can influence their distribution. Furthermore, certain plants have a higher affinity for mycorrhizal relationships than others. Therefore, while the nutrient content could be playing a decisive role, the agricultural history of the parcels and the types of crops previously grown there could also influence the distribution of AM fungi. For a definitive conclusion, soil samples should be taken from both parcels and tested for their nutrient content in a soil testing laboratory. This would not only validate the above-stated hypothesis but also provide deeper insights into the overall soil health and fertility status which is of prime importance for agricultural productivity. Furthermore, understanding the specific relationship between the local plant hosts and the AM fungi could provide useful knowledge for picking the right crops to cultivate or for creating a long-term crop rotation plan."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],R={key:0},j={key:1};function F(o,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
