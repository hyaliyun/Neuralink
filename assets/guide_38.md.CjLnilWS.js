Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge? The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden.

Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

Context: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November.

Mok, an aging yet legendary rock musician, is on the search for a very special voice that can unleash a powerful demon from another dimension to fulfill his wish of being immortalized as a musician/Magic Man. After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs. He invites Angel and the band to his mansion outside of town. Omar goads Mok upon meeting him, annoying Mok enough to suggest the band tries \\"Edison Balls\\"- a modern drug, which Omar and Stretch take, incapacitating them. Dizzy sneaks away. Meanwhile, Mok takes Angel on a stroll through his garden and tries to convince her to join him. Initially unaware of Mok's true intentions, she refuses to abandon her band. Unwilling to admit defeat, Mok kidnaps her and takes his blimp to Nuke York, where his summoning, disguised as a concert, will be performed. After Dizzy snaps his band-mates out of their stupor, the trio find out what happened to Angel and they follow the blimp in a stolen police car.

Question 1: Which book is better for physics- Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick and Walker;Physics by Resnick, Halliday and Krane or Feynman Lectures in physics? Question 2: Which is best book for IIT JEE Physics theory HC Verma or Resnick Halliday or university Physics-Zemanasci? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer: The best book for learning physics depends on the level of preparation, background knowledge, and specific goals of the reader. To provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to both inquiries, I will analyze each book based on its suitability for physics education and the IIT JEE exam. 1. Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker: This book is quite popular among students and teachers alike for its systematic approach to building a strong foundation in physics. It covers both theoretical and experimental aspects of the subject, with a focus on problem-solving skills. The well-structured content is easy to comprehend, making it ideal for students who are new to physics or preparing for competitive exams like the IIT JEE. Furthermore, the book includes numerous examples, illustrations, and supplementary information to enhance the learning experience. 2. Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane: This is another excellent book for physics enthusiasts as it provides a detailed explanation of fundamental concepts and theories. Similar to the Fundamentals of Physics, this book emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills, but it delves deeper into the subject matter. The comprehensive collection of examples and problems make it suitable for students with a strong foundation in physics who are aiming for a deeper understanding. 3. Feynman Lectures in Physics: Written by the renowned physicist Richard P. Feynman, this book is an extraordinary resource for those who are passionate about physics. The lectures adopt an unconventional approach to exploring the subject, weaving in practical examples and thought-provoking discussions rather than focusing solely on mathematical rigor. This feature makes the book an exciting read for students with a strong physics background and a thirst for knowledge. However, because the book may not adhere to traditional exam syllabi, it is less suitable for exam preparation. To answer the first question, a choice between Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick, and Walker; Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane, or Feynman Lectures in Physics depends on the readers' individual needs and backgrounds. For a solid foundation and exam preparation, Fundamentals of Physics is the ideal choice. Physics by Resnick, Halliday, and Krane is appropriate for those desiring a deeper understanding, while Feynman Lectures in Physics is perfect for physics enthusiasts interested in a non-traditional approach to learning the subject. For the second question, I will examine the three mentioned books in the context of IIT JEE Physics theory preparation: 1. HC Verma's Concepts of Physics: This book is specifically designed for IIT JEE exam preparations, making it an excellent choice for students focused on competitive entrance exams. Concepts of Physics covers the syllabus in a targeted manner, presenting both the necessary theories and problem-solving techniques. Moreover, the book offers a plethora of solved examples and practice problems, as well as concise descriptions of the fundamentals. 2. Resnick Halliday's Fundamentals of Physics: While this book provides an in-depth understanding of physics concepts, it may not be specifically tailored to the IIT JEE exam. However, due to its clarity and breadth of coverage, it can still be used as a supplementary resource to enhance understanding and problem-solving skills. 3. University Physics by Zemanaski: As a college-level physics textbook, this book covers fundamental concepts from a more advanced perspective. Although it has a strong focus on practice problems and critical thinking, its alignment with the IIT JEE syllabus might not be ideal. Students preparing for the IIT JEE should consider using University Physics as a supplementary resource for a deeper understanding. In conclusion, the answer to both questions might not be the same. For the first question, students should select the book that best aligns with their goals, background knowledge, and learning preferences. For the second question, HC Verma's Concepts of Physics is the most appropriate choice for IIT JEE Physics theory preparation due to its targeted approach and specific focus on the exam syllabus. However, students can also use the other books mentioned as supplementary resources to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oh, boy, God bless the 1970's, we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist, Jaws, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and now, Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. Whenever Marcella leaves the room, Raggedy Ann, along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However, the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel, he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge of a cliff, into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on. While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie, this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a \\"WTF?!\\" movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

The coalition won 88 seats to Labor's 57 in the 150-seat parliament. Liberal leader Tony Abbott, who will be prime minister, promised a competent and trustworthy government. Outgoing PM Kevin Rudd earlier admitted defeat and said he would not stand again for the Labor leadership. The main election issues were how to tackle an expected economic slowdown, whether to keep a tax on carbon emissions, and how to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat. Mr Rudd had called the election after defeating Julia Gillard in a leadership challenge in June, amid dismal polling figures that showed Labor on course for a wipe-out. Profile: Tony Abbott Under Mr Rudd, Labor initially saw its figures improve. But Mr Abbott, who enjoyed the strident support of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, then widened the gap again. \\"From today I declare Australia is under new management and Australia is now open for business\\", Mr Abbott told a cheering crowd as he delivered a victory speech. He said that he would put the budget back into surplus, and stop boats bringing migrants from Asia. He added that support for Labor was at its lowest ebb for 100 years, and that the results showed the Australian people would punish anyone who took them for granted. Mr Rudd said he had phoned Mr Abbott and wished him well. \\"I gave it my all but it was not enough for us to win,\\" he said. But he was pleased that Labor was preserved as a \\"viable fighting force for the future\\". Mr Rudd retained his seat in the Brisbane constituency of Griffith but said he would not re-contest the Labor party leadership because the Australian people \\"deserve a fresh start\\". \\"I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight. As your Labor leader I accept it as my responsibility,\\" he said. The Australian Election Commission confirmed on its website that the Liberal-National coalition had won 88 seats in the House of Representatives, and Labor 57. Three seats were distributed between three small parties, and there were two seats still to return results. In the previous parliament, Labor relied on the support of independents and the Greens for its minority government, with 71 seats to the coalition's 72. Mr Abbott took on the leadership of the flagging Liberal-National coalition in 2009. A Rhodes scholar who once wanted to be a Roman Catholic priest, Mr Abbott has pledged to repeal both the mining and carbon taxes introduced by Labor. He has also promised a raft of budget cuts, including reducing the foreign aid budget by A4.5bn (4bn; Â£2.6bn). But he says he will fund an expanded paid parental leave scheme. British Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first to congratulate him on the victory, writing on Twitter that \\"it'll be great working with another centre-right leader\\". By Jon DonnisonBBC News, Sydney Labor's six years in power are emphatically over. Australia's economic growth during difficult global financial times should have played well for an incumbent government. But the economy has begun to slow and Kevin Rudd's Labor party has been undone by disunity and infighting. The rivalry between Mr Rudd and Julia Gillard which saw the leadership of the party and the country switch back and forth did not sit well with voters. You sense from voters that Mr Abbott's victory is not so much a ringing endorsement as a rejection of Labor. He's a conservative who has promised a tough line on immigration and asylum-seekers. He opposes gay marriage and has been a sceptic on climate change. Kevin Rudd sold himself as the comeback kid. It didn't work. His party now faces a period of further introspection. Australia largely avoided the recession that hit the UK and other Western nations thanks to a natural resources boom. But the boom is coming to an end, and Mr Abbott will be charged with managing the transition. Ahead of the polls, his coalition highlighted bitter Labor infighting, seeking to portray itself as the more stable party. And former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke blamed the internal divisions for Labor's defeat. \\"I really believe this was an election that was lost by the government rather than one that was won by the opposition,\\" he said. Julia Gillard, meanwhile, congratulated the Labor candidate who succeeded her in her seat, as she bowed out of politics. The outsider candidates had mixed fortunes at the polls. One of the two undecided seats in the House sees billionaire Clive Palmer, famous for his attempt to build a new version of the Titanic based on the original designs, on course for victory. However, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange missed out on a Senate seat in Victoria, where the final place was claimed by Rick Muir of the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party. More than 14 million people were registered to vote in Saturday's election. Voting is compulsory in Australia. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In an election, one group of people (called the coalition) won 88 seats and another group (called Labor) won 57 seats in the 150-seat parliament. The leader of the winning group, Tony Abbott, will now be the prime minister of Australia. The old prime minister, Kevin Rudd, admitted that they lost and he won't try to be the leader of the Labor group again. The important topics for the election were about money, taxes, and people coming to Australia to live. People in Australia were not happy with the Labor group because they kept changing their leader, so they voted for the coalition group instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the age of 65 most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, and smoking cessation.

The text seems to explain the functionality of a card/mechanic in the game. In English, it translates as: \\"When you cast a creature spell, put X 1/1 black Thrull creature tokens into play, where X is the converted mana cost of that spell.\\" To elaborate, in the context of the game: \\"When you cast a creature spell\\": This refers to the action of playing a creature card from your hand. Casting a spell involves paying a cost, usually in the form of mana, and the spell (in this context, the creature) taking effect on the game. \\"Put X 1/1 black Thrull creature tokens into play\\": This part is explaining what the card effect does upon casting the creature spell. In this case, you place a number of 1/1 Black Thrull creature tokens on the battlefield. In MTG, tokens are typically creatures which aren't represented by regular cards but are created by spells or abilities. \\"Where X is the converted mana cost of that spell\\": This provides the explanation for the value of X — how many tokens you generate. The \\"converted mana cost\\" (CMC) is a system in MTG that describes the total amount of mana needed to cast a spell. The CMC is calculated by adding up all the symbols in a card's mana cost, regardless of color.

Reload the page if the film is choppy or stops loading.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Maximizing Your Online Viewing Experience: Streaming vs. Downloading and Efficient Link Management Introduction With an increasing number of people turning to the internet for their entertainment needs, efficient management of streaming and downloading links is crucial in order to optimize the overall online viewing experience. Despite the vast potential of the digital space, a significant number of users face choppiness and lagging issues due to poor preparation and lack of proper knowledge. This article seeks to explore the differences between streaming and downloading, the importance of setting up multiple links, and the steps to ensure smooth film loading for an uninterrupted experience. I. Understanding Streaming and Downloading When it comes to consuming online media, users have two primary options: streaming or downloading. Understanding the pros and cons of each method is essential for making an informed decision about your viewing preferences. 1. Streaming: This involves the real-time transmission of video or audio content via the internet to the viewer's device. In simple terms, streaming allows the content to start playing immediately without needing to download the full file beforehand. The main advantage of this method is instant access, making it ideal for live events and current content. However, streaming requires a stable and fast internet connection, as the quality of the stream heavily relies on the bandwidth. Additionally, if the viewer loses their connection, the stream may buffer, causing interruption and choppiness. 2. Downloading: When downloading content, the user saves the video or audio files directly onto their device. This method enables offline access and prevents connection-based disruptions. While downloading requires more time to gather the entire file upfront, it generally provides a smoother playback experience. However, it's worth noting that downloading requires more storage space and may come with copyright restrictions or legal implications. II. Setting Up Multiple Links for Enhanced Viewing Utilizing several links can significantly boost your online viewing experience, providing the user with alternative options should one link fail or buffer. Here are some practical reasons and steps for maximizing link efficiency: 1. Diversify your sources: To maximize video quality and minimize lag, opt for different sources or websites with separate servers. This technique reduces the chances of facing a bottleneck due to high traffic or server issues. 2. Use multiple browsers: Opening various links in different browsers helps distribute the load, preventing crashes and improving overall performance. This step is particularly useful if the user's device has limited processing power or RAM. 3. Prioritize your content: If streaming multiple episodes or content simultaneously, prioritize your desired viewing order by allocating more bandwidth and processing power to the top-priority video. This method ensures you receive the best quality for the content you are most interested in. III. Ensuring Smooth Film Loading for Seamless Viewing Nothing dampens the online viewing experience quite like lag or buffering. Consider these steps for ensuring your content loads smoothly and continuously: 1. Allow sufficient time for loading: Give your content ample time to load before starting playback, as this helps diminish the chances of stuttering or buffering. Patience is key, so wait for the buffer bar to make significant progress before hitting play. 2. Monitor your internet connection: Make sure your internet connection is stable and strong. If on Wi-Fi, ensure you are within range for the optimal signal. Additionally, refrain from sharing your connection with multiple devices, as this could decrease bandwidth. 3. Clear cache and temporary files: To enhance browser performance, clear your cache and temporary internet files regularly. This tactic frees up valuable resources, allowing for smoother playback. 4. Reload the page when necessary: If your content becomes choppy or stops loading, refresh the page. Sometimes, reconnecting to the server can resolve streaming issues. Conclusion The digital age has ushered in an era of convenience and instant access to video and audio content. By understanding the differences between streaming and downloading, managing multiple links, and ensuring smooth film loading, you position yourself to optimize your online viewing experience. In turn, this allows for seamless enjoyment of your desired content without the distractions of buffering or lag."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These events help shape her perspective and reinforce the importance of obedience and respect towards parental authority, while also giving her a sense of responsibility. The following is a detailed breakdown of the critical milestones in Young Sasha's journey before she becomes aware of the need to obey her mother. 1. Experiencing the consequences of disobedience: Before Sasha understands the importance of obeying her mother, she may have faced several instances where her lack of obedience led to unfavorable outcomes, such as getting scolded or experiencing negative consequences. These situations make her realize that not following her mother's instructions can lead to unpleasant results. 2. Observing her peers: As Sasha interacts with other children, she sees how her friends and classmates fare when they listen to their parents or guardians. She may observe that those who obey their parents tend to have better relationships and lesser conflicts, and this understanding influences her growing awareness of the value of listening to her mother. 3. Learning the concept of respect: Through various channels such as school, media, or family discussions, Sasha starts to grasp the notion of respect and its importance in maintaining healthy relationships with others, including her parents. She learns that respecting one's parents includes listening to them and following their guidance. 4. Building trust in her mother's wisdom: As Sasha encounters various situations and observes her mother's reactions and guidance, she begins to develop trust in her mother's wisdom and judgment. She starts recognizing that her mother has more experience and knowledge than herself, and it would be beneficial for her to adhere to her mother's advice. 5. Developing a sense of responsibility: As Sasha matures, she develops a sense of responsibility towards herself and her actions. She learns that her decisions have consequences, and it becomes increasingly important to make choices that lead to positive outcomes. This realization fosters her need to heed her mother's instructions as they usually guide her towards making better decisions. 6. Receiving praise and encouragement: Sasha might experience instances where she follows her mother's guidance, and as a result, receives praise and encouragement.

The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.

A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder.

Unfortunately, a large buildup of pressure leaks from one of the pipes that starts to form a yellow toxic cloud that drifts across the ground. Meanwhile, a school bus is taking children home, after dropping one child off with only five children left on the bus: Paul MacKenize, Jenny Freemont, Ellen Chandler, Tommy Button, and Janet Shore. Cathy drives past the school bus and waves to the children as they are singing road songs. Suddenly the bus passes through the yellow cloud. Cathy arrives home, but the school bus is detained somewhere. After Billy Hart, the local sheriff, finds the idling bus abandoned near a cemetery and the children's possessions still on it, he radios his deputy Harry Timmons and Molly, an older woman who works at the local general store and acts as the part-time police dispatcher. Paul's sister Suzie is seemingly a slutty blonde who's only interested in the dopey town deputy, Harry Timmons and tries to seduce him. Billy orders Timmons to set up a roadblock at the intersection of the main highway and the lone road leading into town, recruiting a couple of armed locals believing that the children were possibly kidnapped. Meanwhile, Dr. Joyce Gould, Tommy's mother's female lover, who's hostile towards the sheriff for no reason goes with him to investigate.

Mali: On 19 November 1968, following progressive economic decline, the Keïta regime was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by Moussa Traoré, a day which is now commemorated as Liberation Day.

His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974, in which famine killed thousands of people.

He was a Roman Catholic archbishop, which means he was like a leader who helped people understand and follow the teachings of Jesus. Oscar Romero was very sad because there was a big fight going on in his country from 1980 to 1992 called the civil war. During this time, many people were not happy and were fighting with each other. Even though it was a scary time, Oscar Romero decided to help those who were suffering and spoke up for peace and fairness for everyone. Sadly, because he was trying to make things better, some people who didn't want change decided to hurt him. In 1980, Oscar Romero was killed while he was praying in a church. Many people in El Salvador and all around the world were very sad because they lost a good and loving friend. However, the story doesn't end there! Many years later, in a big and special celebration, Oscar Romero was beatified. What does that mean? Well, when the Roman Catholic Church beatifies someone, it is like giving them a special award that says they were a very good person and they are now in Heaven with God. This is a big honor for Oscar Romero and his family. The celebration for beatifying Oscar Romero was very important and many people from El Salvador and other countries came to remember him. They said prayers, sang songs, and talked about the good things he did for people. This event made many people happy because they could think of Oscar Romero as someone special in Heaven who's watching over them.

Sarah's publisher, John Bosload, offers her his country house near Lacoste, France for some rest and relaxation. Sarah takes him up on the offer, hinting that she hopes John may come and visit as well. After becoming comfortable with the run of the spacious, sun-filled house, and meeting the groundskeeper Marcel, Sarah's quietude is disrupted by a young woman claiming to be the publisher's daughter, Julie.

Julie's sex life consists of one-night stands with various oafish men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women.

What type of thing is the question \\"Who was Jinnah ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"Who was Jinnah?\\" is inquiring about a historical figure, specifically Muhammad Ali Jinnah. This type of question is seeking factual information about a person’s life, achievements, beliefs, and their impact on society or history. In this case, it refers to Jinnah's role in history, particularly as it pertains to the nation of Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, often known as Quaid-e-Azam, or 'the great leader,' is central to Pakistan's history. Born in Karachi, British India in 1876, he was an important political figure instrumental in the creation of Pakistan as a separate nation from India in 1947. He was the leader of the All India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's establishment on August 14, 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is commemorated in Pakistan as the Father of the Nation. His birthday on December 25 is a national holiday in Pakistan invoking a wealth of patriotism. Jinnah worked as a barrister in Bombay after studying law in England and rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the twentieth century. In those early years of political life, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, assisting to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League. However, he became disillusioned by the Congress party's politics and the rising Hindu-Muslim nationalist conflicts, leaving the party in the 1920s. Jinnah subsequently took charge of the Muslim League and proposed a two-nation theory advocating the creation of a separate Muslim nation. His adamant insistence on safeguarding the rights of Muslims within India eventually led to the demand for a separate nation. Jinnah's leadership, negotiating skills, legal acumen, and political strategy led to the creation of the state of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Jinnah became the newly formed nation's first Governor-General, providing crucial leadership during the country's volatile early years. Despite severe health issues, he worked tirelessly to establish the government and Constitution for the fledgling state before his death on September 11, 1948. Hence, any question asking \\"Who was Jinnah?\\" is requesting details about this significant historical figure, his life, political career, contributions to Pakistan's founding, and his roles and responsibilities as its leader. Furthermore, it may also be seeking information about his beliefs, values, speeches, or decisions that led to the birth of a new nation, and the impacts of such actions on today's geopolitical landscapes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has issued a statement after a preteen from South Carolina and an elderly couple visiting Boone died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same hotel room two months apart. \\"My heartfelt condolences go out to the families and loved ones of Shirley and Daryl Jenkins, and young Jeffrey Williams,\\" said Health Department Secretary Aldona Wos on Sunday. \\"These deaths were a tragedy that should have never happened. The Department of Health and Human Services is continuing to gather the facts. I have instructed my staff to work with local officials to identify measures to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.\\" On Friday, a source from the NC Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to WBTV News that Dr. Brent Hall, the pathologist in Boone who performed the autopsies on Daryl and Shirley Jenkins has resigned his post. Documents uncovered by WBTV News show the NC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner discovered two weeks ago that carbon monoxide poisoning may have killed 72-year-old Shirley Mae Jenkins. That was seven days before 11-year old Jeffrey Williams died from CO exposure while staying in the same room at the Best Western Hotel in Boone. According to officials in Raleigh, the results of that test were sent to the pathologist in Watauga County who was investigating the deaths. We don't know why those results were not passed on to local fire or police investigators. It's also unclear if the Best Western was notified of the potential danger in room 225. Tests have now also confirmed Jenkins husband Daryl also died from carbon monoxide poisoning. State medical officials say a preteen from Rock Hill had high levels of carbon monoxide in his system after he died in a hotel room in Boone last weekend. The levels are consistent with levels found in an elderly couple who died in the same room at the Best Western Hotel in Boone two months ago. The results came back late Thursday from the State Medical Examiner's Office. According to the results, 11-year-old Jeffery Williams had a blood concentration of carbon monoxide was greater than 60 percent. Medical officials noted that these CO levels would have caused the asphyxia, which was noted as Williams' cause of death in his autopsy. Officials say this level of concentration is consistent with the levels found in both Daryl and Shirley Jenkins, a couple in their 70s who died in the same room back in April. On Wednesday, state and federal inspectors say they traced the source of a carbon monoxide leak to a pool water heater room directly under room 225, where Williams and the Jenkins died. Fire investigators say the exhaust was being pulled back into the room from a wall mounted vent for the room's HVAC unit. They also said the ventilation system had several deficiencies as well as corrosion. According to investigators, Williams body was found Saturday. Jeffrey's mother, 49-year-old Jeannie Williams, was taken to the hospital for treatment. During the emergency medical response, a presumptive test indicated an elevated level of carbon monoxide in the room, officials told WBTV. The hotel was evacuated and assistance was requested from North Carolina Emergency Management and the North Carolina Public Health Preparedness and Response Branch. Samples from Williams were sent to the Office of the State Medical Examiner for toxicological analysis. Investigators say the bodies of Daryl and Shirley Jenkins were found in the same room back on April 16. Family members say they waited weeks for test results to come back, but on Monday confirmed that the Jenkins, who were in their early 70's, died from carbon monoxide toxicity. The couple was visiting from Washington, family members say, and were in Boone for a family reunion. Family members say if the tests hadn't taken so long, the problem that caused their deaths could have been fixed or the room remained closed so no one, including the boy who died, could stay there. Investigators said they had been requesting the results from the State Medical Examiner's office for weeks but got no response. State inspectors arrived at the hotel on Wednesday morning around 10 a.m. According to documents from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the pool permit was suspended on March 6. One problem listed in the report was that the chemical/equipment room was required to have natural cross ventilation or forced air ventilation. \\"This needs to be corrected ASAP,\\" the report states. WBTV has learned that the pool permit has since been re-instated, but can find no records of the problem being fixed. By pure coincidence, the same health inspector who inspected the pool on March 6th, was at the hotel when the elderly couple was found and helped perform CPR. Beth Lovette, the director of the Appalachian Regional Health District office said Tuesday when her inspectors looked at that pool room they were only concerned about the pool chemicals. Lovette said her inspector did not look at any appliances in the room and did not check about combustible or poisonous gases that may be coming from that equipment. That was not part of the health department inspector's duties, she said. The heater in question hasn't been inspected since the hotel was built in 2000. Officials say there is nothing that requires the heater to be reinspected, but state licensing experts and one from the consumer product safety commission are looking at it now Though the report was dated March 6, 2013, health officials could not say if the ventilation work was ever done. \\"We have not received any paperwork back from the hotel,\\" said Lovette. According to police officials, the police department has been in contact with the District Attorney's Office and police have not ruled out possible charges. Carbon monoxide detectors are not required in hotels in North Carolina. The hotel remains closed and under the control of investigators. Investigators ask that anyone that stayed in room 225, contact the Boone Police Department at 828-268-6900 or email Sgt. Matt Stevens at matt.stevens@townofboone.net. A memorial service for 11-year-old Jeffrey Williams will be held in Rock Hill on Sunday at First Baptist Church on Dave Lyle Boulevard at 2:00 pm. The burial will be private. Copyright 2013 WBTV. All rights reserved. ||||| An 11-year-old Rock Hill boy died in a Boone motel over the weekend, just two months after a couple died mysteriously in the same room. Police said Jeffrey Lee Williams, 11, was found dead in his room at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza. His mother, Jeannie Williams, 49, was listed in critical condition at a Boone hospital Saturday night, but her condition was not known Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, police said there was no danger to the general public. “The investigation and testing is ongoing,” Sgt. Shane Robbins said in a news release, adding he didn’t expect additional information to be released until Tuesday at the earliest. Police did not identify the couple, but a Washington state man said his elderly parents died in the same hotel on April 16, and he said he believes that something in the room may have contributed to their deaths. He said he was outraged that the room continued to be rented before the toxicology reports on his parents were returned. “Do you know how mad I am right now?” asked Doug Jenkins. “Why are they still renting out this room?” Representatives of the motel could not be reached late Sunday. Throughout the day, calls were being forwarded to the Country Inn and Suites, which shares the same parking lot as the Best Western. Emergency responders were called to the motel, at 840 E. King St., around 12:30 p.m. Saturday, after getting reports of a medical emergency involving two people, officials said. The boy was pronounced dead at the motel, and his mother was taken to Watauga Medical Center by ambulance for treatment. The Williams family’s pastor, Scott Davis of Northside Baptist Church in Rock Hill, said on Saturday that the pair were on a family vacation. Relatives are devastated, he said. Davis could not be reached on Sunday. Authorities said they were exploring the possibility that Jeffrey Williams’ death could be linked to the deaths of Jenkins’ parents. Robbins says detectives are testing possible evidence related to the dead boy as well as features of the room. “While no evidence has been discovered that these incidents are related, investigators continue to explore all possibilities,” Robbins said in a statement on Saturday. Start of vacation Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, both of Longview, Wash., died within hours of each other April 16 in hotel room No. 225. Doug Jenkins said his parents were visiting Boone at the beginning of what was to be a three-week vacation, with the entire family planning to meet in Las Vegas near the end. He last communicated with his parents around 7:48 p.m. His parents had said they felt a little chilly when getting off the elevator, Jenkins said. His sister sent a message to their parents around 11:40 p.m., but the message was never read, he said. His aunt and uncle, who were traveling with his parents, found the pair in a position that would suggest they hadn’t died from a sudden medical condition, he said, although he declined to elaborate. “They were two healthy people who died within 2 feet of each other. Mom had her cellphone 2 feet away from her,” he said. “Things just don’t add up.” Lawsuit possible Doug Jenkins said the family is waiting on the results of the couple’s toxicology reports to come back before filing a lawsuit against the hotel, although they are already working with a lawyer. The autopsy report proved inconclusive, he said. About a month after his parents’ deaths, Jenkins said a lawyer representing the family had told the motel not to make any changes to the room before the family could perform an independent investigation. Jenkins said his family is distraught that another family is going through the kind of pain they experienced. ||||| 11-year-old found dead in Boone hotel identified BOONE, N.C. -- Boone police confirm that an elderly couple was found dead in April in the same hotel room where an 11-year-old Rock Hill boy died Saturday. Jeffrey Lee Williams and his mother Jeannie Williams were found unresponsive on the second floor of the Best Western hotel on East King Street in Boone around 12:30 Saturday afternoon. Jeffrey was pronounced dead. Jeannie, 49, was taken to Watauga Medical Center. Her famlily says she woke up from a coma Sunday and is listed in stable conditon. As of Sunday evening, she did not yet know about her son's death. Pastor Scott Davis of Northside Baptist Church in Rock Hill said the boy's father is devastated. Davis said the mother and son were staying in Boone on a \\"family vacation,\\" but they were the only two family members there. There are other children in the family, but they were not at the hotel. Davis and the boy's father traveled to Boone Saturday afternoon after hearing of the death. Boone police were still on scene late Saturday, and confirmed that the son and mother were staying in the same room where an elderly couple were found dead on April 16 -- less than two months ago. \\"It was actually the same room,\\" said Boone Police Sgt. Shane Robbins. \\"But other than that, at this time, we don't have any more links or correlation.\\" That case is still under investigation, said Sgt. Robbins. Investigators are still awaiting results of toxicology tests, and can't speculate about whether the two cases are connected. Robbins said there did not appear to be any violence involved in the young boy's death or the mother's illness. Guests were evacuated from the hotel Saturday. Workers in hazardous materials suits were able to remove some of the guests' belongings for them, so they could find another place to stay. A regional hazmat team from Asheville was brought in to do forensic tests on the hotel room. Police say there is no danger to the public and tests are still being done. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement after a preteen and an elderly couple died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same hotel room two months apart. The pathologist who performed the autopsies has resigned, and it is unclear if the hotel was notified of the potential danger in the room.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of cooking pasta, I recommend the following method, which makes the most sense due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and adaptability to different pasta shapes and types. This method is appropriate for both fresh and dried pasta varieties. Ingredients: - Pasta (about 4-6 ounces or 100-170 grams per person, depending on serving size) - Water (roughly 4 quarts or 4 liters per pound or 450 grams of pasta) - Salt (1-2 tablespoons) Equipment: - Large pot - Colander - Fork or pasta spoon - Timer Instructions: 1. Choose the right pot: Select a large pot with enough capacity to hold the water, pasta, and allow for expansion as the pasta cooks. Having enough room will prevent the pasta from sticking together and ensure even cooking. 2. Boil the water: Fill the large pot with water according to the ratio mentioned above (4:1 water to pasta). Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to high. Bring the water to a rolling boil. 3. Salt the water: Once the water is boiling, add 1-2 tablespoons of salt to the pot. This helps flavor the pasta as it cooks, so don't be shy with your measurements. Stir the salt into the boiling water to dissolve it completely. 4. Add the pasta: Slowly pour the pasta into the boiling salted water, making sure to separate any strands or pieces that may stick together. It's crucial to maintain the boil, as adding the pasta may momentarily reduce the temperature of the water. 5. Stir the pasta: Using a fork or pasta spoon, give the pasta a gentle stir to ensure that it doesn't stick to the pot or clump together. Continue stirring occasionally throughout the cooking process to keep the pasta separated and to ensure even cooking. 6. Set a timer: Consult the pasta packaging for the recommended cooking time, which will vary depending on the type and shape of the pasta. If there's a range, for example, 8-11 minutes, start with the lower end to check for doneness. If the pasta is fresh, the cooking time will be significantly shorter (usually around 2-4 minutes). 7. Taste for doneness: As the timer approaches the end of the recommended cooking time, use a fork or pasta spoon to remove a single piece of pasta from the pot for sampling. Taste it to ensure that it's cooked to your preferred texture. The pasta should be cooked to al dente—firm to the bite but not crunchy or overly soft. 8. Drain the pasta: Once the pasta is cooked to your desired level of doneness, turn off the heat. Place a colander in the sink and carefully pour the pasta and water into it to drain the pasta. Give the colander a few shakes to remove any excess water. 9. Sauce or dress the pasta: After draining the pasta, transfer it back to the pot or to a serving dish. At this stage, you can toss the pasta with your sauce of choice or dress it with a simple combination of olive oil, salt, pepper, and grated cheese. 10. Serve immediately: Pasta is best enjoyed right away, so be sure to serve it promptly while it's still warm. You can pair it with a side salad, bread, or roasted vegetables for a complete meal. Remember that this method is versatile and allows for adjustments based on specific pasta types. Enjoy your perfectly cooked pasta!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Early big winners of ObamaCare: investors, lawyers, consultants, tech experts While polling data suggests many Americans remain anxious and skeptical about ObamaCare, the early big winners of the president’s signature law include investors, lawyers, consultants and purveyors of new technology. Since March 23, 2010, when it was signed into law, the health care sector of stocks in the S&P 500 has increased in value by 50 percent. Gilead Sciences, a California-based drug maker with 5,000 workers, has seen its stock price explode by 157 percent in the last three and a half years. Health insurers Cigna, Aetna and United Health have each seen healthy gains since President Obama signed the reform measure. Those companies as well as hospital operators Tenet Healthcare and Health Management Associates have seen stock gains far above the S&P's overall 16.9 percent jump. On a smaller scale, lawyers with expertise understanding ObamaCare are winners, too. Arthur Tacchino grew up near Philadelphia and says he always wanted to be a lawyer. He earned his law degree in 2010 and while some of his fellow graduates struggled to find work, Tacchino says he's fortunate to have stumbled into a job asking him to become an ObamaCare expert. Even though he didn't have an interest in health care, he's now taken his intricate knowledge of the law to the private sector, where he's part of a small team selling software programs to companies needing help managing the new law’s red tape. \\"We're trying to create an aid for people who need to understand the law and might not have the legal education they need to understand it,\\" Tacchino recently explained from his home office in the Philly suburbs. SyncStream Solutions is one of many small niche companies profiting from the complexity of the law and its mandates and Tacchino says most people are surprised to learn about new administrative tasks demanded by ObamaCare. He highlights one that forces businesses to keep close count on the number of hours worked by part-time workers and report that information to the federal government. He likens it to paperwork for taxes or payroll. \\"Business has been fantastic,\\" Tacchino boasts. \\"I mean we've partnered with some major clients all over the country and it seems as we grow and expand our business more people hear about us and realize there is a need for what we're doing.\\" Consultants and lobbyists with ties to ObamaCare have also done well in recent years as large companies struggle with implementing the law while also trying to persuade government officials to tailor rules to their liking. \\"It's no secret to anyone that the mechanics of what has happened with ObamaCare have been driven by some very strong lobbying from the private industry,\\" Dr. Sreedhar Potarazu, founder of VitalSpring Technologies Inc., told Fox News. Some of the key behind-the-scenes players who helped write the law and draft regulations implementing ObamaCare are now lobbying on behalf of corporate clients. Consulting companies, a frequent go-to resource for businesses who want outside expertise, have also beefed up their ObamaCare offerings. \\"The likes of Accenture, Deloit [and] the major consulting firms are really trying to get into the market in terms of helping guide and bring together the chaos by laying out a strategy in terms of how all of these various dots need to connect,\\" Potarazu explained. But he also warns that the constant changes in the law's technical requirements may prove problematic for anyone who doesn't pay close attention to what's happening in Washington. One of ObamaCare's requirements is a mandate forcing doctors and hospitals to move towards electronic record keeping. Shareholders in some of these firms have done quite well in recent years: Athena Health is up 180 percent and Cerner is up 110 percent since ObamaCare became law. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Since the implementation of ObamaCare, investors, lawyers, consultants, and technology experts have experienced significant growth and profits. The health care sector of stocks in the S&P 500 increased in value by 50% since the law was signed.

Consulting companies and lobbyists with ties to ObamaCare have also profited in recent years as large companies navigate the law's implementation.

How to make a chocolate cookie dough cake Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 176 degrees celsius. Grease three 6 inch (15. 2 cm) round cake pans and dust with cocoa powder. Combine the dry ingredients together.","completion":"Step 1: Combine the wet ingredients together in a separate bowl Justification: Mixing the wet ingredients separately ensures an even distribution of all the elements when they combine with the dry ingredients, leading to a smoother and more homogeneously mixed batter. Step 2: Carefully pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix them with a spatula until well combined Justification: Slowly incorporating the wet and dry ingredients together prevents overmixing, which can result in a tough and chewy final product. Step 3: If necessary, fold in any additional components, such as chocolate chips or nuts Justification: Folding in extra ingredients at this stage ensures their even distribution throughout the batter. Step 4: Divide the cookie dough batter evenly between the three prepared cake pans Justification: Dividing the batter evenly ensures equal baking time for all three layers, leading to a consistent final product. Step 5: Bake the cake layers in the preheated oven for approximately 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean Justification: Baking at the specified temperature and time allows the cake to cook evenly and rise properly. Step 6: Remove the cake layers from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10-15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely Justification: Allowing the cakes to cool slightly in the pans helps set their structure, preventing them from breaking when transferring to a rack. Cooling the layers completely on a wire rack ensures they don't become overly moist or soggy from the residual heat in the pans. Step 7: Prepare your desired frosting or filling for the cake Justification: A good frosting or filling not only adds flavor but also helps hold the cake layers together. Step 8: Assemble the cake by placing one layer on a cake stand or serving plate, topping it with a layer of frosting or filling, then stacking the remaining layers in the same manner Justification: Assembling the cake in this way ensures a secure, even, and balanced end product. Step 9: Finish the cake by frosting the top and sides, if desired, and decorating with additional components like chocolate shavings or fresh fruit Justification: Adding the finishing touches of frosting and decorations enhances the overall appearance and taste of the cake. Step 10: Allow the assembled cake to set in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight before serving Justification: Letting the cake set helps the layers become more cohesive and ensures a neat, clean slice when it's time to serve."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Blank (John Cusack) finds himself depressed and irritable, dissatisfied with his work and the increasing competition from rival assassins, including Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), whose efforts to cartelize the business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the solitary Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his (understandably nervous) therapist (Alan Arkin) and his secretary (Joan Cusack), already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contract.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store. Reconnecting with friends like Paul (Jeremy Piven) is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile Martin is being stalked by rival hitmen, including Grocer and Felix LaPoubelle (Benny Urquidez), a Basque terrorist hired to kill him; as well as two awkward National Security Agency agents (Hank Azaria and K.

The clowns, attending an annual convention in Mexico City, chanted: \\"We are clowns, not killers\\". The craze, in which people dress up as clowns and scare people, spread quickly with the help of social media. Scary clowns were first reported in the US in August and quickly spread to the UK, Australia and Brazil. Last week, five teenagers dressed as clowns were detained in the Mexican city of Mexicali after frightening people with bats. Clown sightings were also reported in the city of Queretaro. The hysteria over the past weeks has prompted police in several countries to increase patrols outside schools, and in some areas fancy dress shops were asked to remove clown masks from the shelves. The craze also saw fast food giant McDonald's limiting the public appearances of its well-known clown mascot, Ronald McDonald. But those who earn a living from the profession are fighting back, hoping to reverse the negativity that has cast a shadow on their trade. Hoi Hoi, a professional clown at the Mexico city convention, told Reuters: \\"There is more good than evil. Clowns show we are good people and we do our work in the best possible way.\\" An Argentine clown who went by the name Fluorescent Plug said: \\"I don't see anything funny about it.\\" Others were concerned about the safety of professional clowns. Tomas Morales, president of the Brotherhood of Latino Clowns, said: \\"If [people] see in the news that we are evil, they can take a machete or a gun and kill a clown.\\" Latin American clowns were dogged by controversy in 2013, when they gathered at that year's convention to deny allegations that one of their colleagues was responsible for the killing of a former Mexican drug cartel leader. The clowns argued at the time that their costumes were frequently stolen and then used to commit crimes. The annual clown convention, known locally as the \\"Kings of Laughter\\" convention, brings together professional clowns from across the continent. There are about 10,000 professional clowns registered in Mexico, according to the Latin-American Clown Association. What was that article about?","completion":"The article is about professional clowns attending an annual convention in Mexico City, protesting against the \\"scary clown\\" craze that has spread across various countries. The craze, where people dress up as clowns to scare others, has negatively impacted the image and profession of clowns. The article mentions increased police patrols and restrictions on clown appearances, such as McDonald's limiting its mascot Ronald McDonald's public presence. Clowns at the convention want to change the negative perception and emphasize that they are good people who perform their work well. The article also discusses concerns regarding the safety of professional clowns, as people might consider them evil and potentially harm them. The convention, known as the \\"Kings of Laughter,\\" unites professional clowns from across Latin America, with around 10,000 registered clowns in Mexico."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. suppose there are no solids to be filtered happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If there are no solids to be filtered, it would indirectly impact a step of the process, leading to LESS waste being removed from the body. Here's an explanation of how the supposed perturbation occurs: The given process describes the general mechanism of waste removal from the blood through the kidneys. Let's break down this process into steps and analyze the possible indirect impacts when there are no solids to be filtered. 1. Fluid waste enters the kidneys: The bloodstream carries both fluid and solid waste matter, such as urea, drugs, and by-products of metabolism. In the absence of solid wastes to be filtered, only fluid waste will still enter the kidneys, and this step will not be directly impacted. 2. Processing moment in the kidneys: If no solid wastes are present to be filtered, the nephrons in the kidneys might function less efficiently. Nephrons are the filtering units of the kidneys, containing a glomerulus and a tubule. The glomerulus filters blood; as a result, smaller molecules like fluid waste and some ions are filtered out, while larger molecules or cells, such as proteins and blood cells, remain in the bloodstream. 3. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: The fluid that has been filtered will then pass through the tubules, where specific ions and molecules might be reabsorbed based on the body's need. If solid waste is absent or there's an imbalance in waste levels, it may indirectly affect the reabsorption of these ions and molecules, potentially leading to an imbalance in their levels within the bloodstream. 4. Bad waste is removed: If there are no solid wastes to be filtered, the nephrons may not function as efficiently in removing the fluid waste. Consequently, less waste could be removed, indirectly impacting the waste removal process efficiency. 5. The final product is turned into urine: Since only fluid waste enters the kidneys in this scenario, the concentration of waste in the urine might be lower, which could also indirectly impact the osmotic balance in the body. In summary, when there are no solid wastes to be filtered, the waste removal process will not be directly impacted. However, it can lead to indirect impacts on various steps of the process, such as reduced reabsorption of vital ions and molecules, resulting in less waste being removed from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - accelerate - carry freight - taxi - produce bang - catch on fire The answer is \\"catch on fire\\" because","completion":"The answer is not limited to just \\"catch on fire,\\" as there can be multiple outcomes when airplanes hit the ground depending on various factors such as the angle of impact, the size of the aircraft, speed, and whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled descent. Some of these factors may lead one or more of the following outcomes: 1. Produce a bang: A sudden impact on the ground can result in a loud noise or explosion, especially if fuel tanks are ruptured during the collision. 2. Catch on fire: As mentioned earlier, ruptured fuel tanks can ignite and cause the aircraft to catch fire. Additionally, sparks produced from the metal scraping against the ground can further contribute to the fire. 3. Accelerate: The momentum from a moving aircraft upon impact can cause it to accelerate, especially if it hits the ground at a certain angle. The aircraft slides and skids across the ground, tearing up or tossing debris in its path. 4. Taxi: In the context of an airplane properly landing on a runway, the term \\"taxi\\" refers to when an aircraft moves on the ground under its own power, usually on a taxiway, while preparing to take off or park at the gate. 5. Carry freight: This option is not directly related to what happens when an airplane hits the ground, as cargo planes are designed to carry freight regardless of the ground impact. In summary, what happens to airplanes when they hit the ground can vary depending on numerous factors. The options provided in the question, except for \\"carry freight,\\" can all occur in different scenarios.

Officers searched his home and seized his computer and his mobile phone. Mr Thanakorn was initially taken to the Technology Crime Suppression Division before being held in custody at an undisclosed military camp for further inquiry, Maj Gen Wicharn Jodtaeng, chief of the NCPO's legal office, said. Maj Gen Wicharn filed a complaint with the Crime Suppression Division on Wednesday accusing Mr Thanakorn of posting the diagram which circulated on the social media a few days ago. It was seen on a political red-shirt Facebook page named “สถาบันคนเสื้อแดงแห่งชาติ ” (The national red shirts institute) at 7.45pm on Tuesday. The diagram suggested corruption in the Rajabhakti Park project and implicated key cabinet and government figures including Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and his wife.

Context: In February 1918 the Red Army overthrew the White Russian-supported Kokand autonomy of Turkestan. Although this move seemed to solidify Bolshevik power in Central Asia, more troubles soon arose for the Red Army as the Allied Forces began to intervene. British support of the White Army provided the greatest threat to the Red Army in Central Asia during 1918. Great Britain sent three prominent military leaders to the area. One was Lt. Col. Bailey, who recorded a mission to Tashkent, from where the Bolsheviks forced him to flee. Another was Gen. Malleson, leading the Malleson Mission, who assisted the Mensheviks in Ashkhabad with a small Anglo-Indian force. However, he failed to gain control of Tashkent, Bukhara and Khiva. The third was Maj. Gen. Dunsterville, who the Bolsheviks drove out of Central Asia only a month after his arrival in August 1918. Despite setbacks due to British invasions during 1918, the Bolsheviks continued to make progress in bringing the Central Asian population under their influence.

Many years later, at the age of twenty-three, I was planning my wedding to Sheldon, who came from a complete loving family, the type I expect. Sheldon and I had already bought our first home with a large, beautifully landscaped yard. As the date grew closer and we took ownership of the home, we began to clean, arrange inside and out. The day before our wedding we were putting the final touches to the yard. We were so pleased with the neatness of it all. But one plant puzzled us. A rosebush located just outside our front door, was completely barren of leaves or buds. It looked liked it might be dead, but since neither of us could be sure, we reluctantly decided to keep it for the time being. That same evening, after the dinner, I was too excited to sleep. Instead I decided I needed some quiet time to reflect on the wedding the next day. I went to the backyard and sat in the warm, clear, star-filled night. It was there that I realized the only thing missing from my wedding day would be my parents. There had been no time to think of this until now and the thought filled me with sadness. After all, every girl dreams of having her father walk her down the aisle and her mother there to comfort her anxiety. Alone in the yard, I began speaking to my mom and dad, just as if I had known they were listening. \\"Give me a sign on my wedding day to let me know you're with me.\\" The next day Sheldon's excited voice repeatedly called my name. I rushed to join him at the front door. \\"I can't believe what I'm about to show you!\\" He stood aside. The barren rosebush had two huge roses in full bloom.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. principles of multiplier slots Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"Principles of Multiplier Slots Multiplier slots are a popular type of slot machine game that utilizes multipliers to increase the player's potential winnings. These games offer an exciting and engaging experience for players, who can potentially win larger payouts by combining multipliers with their bets. In this detailed explanation, we will look at the principles that govern multiplier slots and help players understand how the game mechanics work. 1. The Concept of Multipliers: The primary principle behind multiplier slots is the idea of using multipliers to boost a player's winnings. A multiplier is a number that multiplies the player's earnings, thereby increasing the payout amount. The multipliers in these games can range from 2x to as high as 100x, depending on the specific slot game. 2. Symbol Multipliers: One common method of implementing multipliers in slot games is through the use of symbol multipliers. In this case, a designated symbol acts as a multiplier when it appears on a winning payline. For example, if a player lands two identical symbols and a 3x multiplier symbol on a payline, the winnings are tripled. 3. Wild Multipliers: Another principle found in multiplier slots is the use of wild multipliers. Wild symbols are unique in that they can substitute for any other symbol on the reels to create a winning combination. In certain games, these wild symbols also act as multipliers, boosting the winnings for the winning paylines they appear on. 4. Scatter Multipliers: Scatter symbols are another popular feature in slot games. These symbols can trigger specific bonus games or features without needing to appear on a payline, as long as there are a predetermined number of them on the reels. In multiplier slots, scatter symbols may also act as multipliers, increasing a player's winnings for that spin. 5. Free Spins with Multiplier Feature: Many multiplier slots incorporate free spins with multipliers as a bonus feature. In this feature, a player is awarded a set number of free spins, during which multipliers are activated, resulting in higher payouts throughout the free spin session. The multiplier can be fixed or can increase with each consecutive spin, adding more excitement and anticipation to the gameplay. 6. Progressive Multipliers: Progressive multipliers are a feature that increases the multiplier amount by a specific increment after each win or after a certain number of spins. This can provide players with a chance to win big as the multiplier value increases over time. Sometimes, the progressive multiplier resets when a player hits a winning payline containing a designated symbol or achieves a particular milestone. 7. Wagering Considerations: Multiplier slots typically offer players the option to increase their wager to activate higher multiplier values. This decision should be based on a player's bankroll and risk tolerance, as higher multipliers usually come with a higher risk, but also offer the potential for more significant payouts. Understanding the principles behind multiplier slots can help players make informed decisions when playing these engaging and potentially lucrative slot games. By combining multipliers with payline wins, players can significantly increase their winnings and enjoy an exhilarating gaming experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It will also keep the temperature displayed in the display window for you to easily record the temperature if needed. Purchase a digital thermometer at your local drug store. Lubricant: you will need a lubricant, preferably one that is water-based, to ensure a smooth and easy insertion of the thermometer into the horse's rectum. This will make the process more comfortable for both you and your horse. Latex or nitrile gloves: it is essential to wear gloves while taking a horse's temperature to maintain proper hygiene and protect your hands from possible contamination. Prepare the horse. Before attempting to take your horse's temperature, it is important to ensure the animal is adequately prepared and in a calm state. Gently approach the horse and be sure to speak to it softly to keep it at ease. Secure your horse in a safe location, such as a stable or an enclosed area, where it will be comfortable and unaffected by distractions. It is also advisable to have another person present to help hold the horse's head and keep it calm during the procedure. Taking the temperature. Begin by putting on your gloves and applying an ample amount of lubricant to the tip of the digital thermometer. With one hand, lift the horse's tail and gently move it to the side, exposing the rectum. Carefully insert the thermometer into the rectum, ensuring that it is inserted parallel to the horse's spine and at a depth of approximately 1-2 inches. This will guarantee the most accurate reading. Hold the thermometer in place, being mindful not to push it in further, and wait for the beep indicating that the temperature has stabilized. Recording and interpreting the temperature. Once the digital thermometer beeps, carefully remove it from your horse's rectum and read the temperature displayed. Normal body temperature for a horse ranges from 99°F to 101.5°F (37.2°C to 38.6°C). If the temperature falls outside of this range, it may be indicative of a fever or an underlying health issue, in which case it is essential to consult with a veterinarian for proper assessment and treatment. Aftercare. After taking the temperature, be sure to clean the thermometer with warm water and mild soap or disinfectant wipes, ensuring it is thoroughly sanitized for future use. Lastly, always remember to be patient and kind with your horse, praising and rewarding it after the procedure is successfully completed to strengthen your bond and foster trust between you both."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What has there been a drastic decline in over the past 100 years that is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water? Answer the above question based on the context below: Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...

Write an article based on this summary: Close relatives of seven current or former Chinese leaders have been found to have links to offshore firms.","completion":"Title: Unveiling the Links Between Close Relatives of Chinese Leaders and Offshore Firms Paragraph 1: Introduction Our journey begins in the vast Chinese political background, where a startling revelation has come to light, casting a shadow over the integrity of some its leaders. As per recent investigations, close relatives of seven current or former Chinese political leaders have been found to have connections with offshore firms. Why This Matters: Understanding the magnitude of this situation requires acknowledging its multi-faced implications, which range from ethical considerations to potential legal repercussions. The offshore companies, which process financial transactions outside the native country, often offer advantageous tax conditions and more privacy. While it is not illegal to own an offshore firm per se, these revelations trigger important questions about possible economic discrepancies, undisclosed family wealth, and potential conflicts of interest that could undermine the legitimacy of the aforementioned leaders. Paragraph 2: Detailing the Findings On closer inspection of the implicated individuals, we find relatives that range from children, spouses to siblings. So far, there hasn't been the release of specific names or the designated roles these relatives play within the offshore companies, primarily due to confidentiality reasons. However, the very existence of these offshore links raises eyebrows and adds an ethical dimension to the issue. Examining the Context: The Chinese political landscape prides itself on its concepts of integrity, transparency, and the rule of law. The façade of this integrity now seems compromised as these revelations paint a very different picture, which needs to be thoroughly addressed. This calls for an examination of the political landscape while educating the public on the possible implications and the importance of accountability. Paragraph 3: The Bigger Picture Although it is critical that these matters are carefully scrutinized, it's also important not to generalize or make preconceived assumptions about offshore companies. Not all offshore businesses participate in unlawful activities - they can significantly contribute to economic growth if managed legitimately. The links found should shine light and not cast shadows - encouraging transparency and fair practices. Why this is global concern? These revelations are not exclusive to China, and this should alarm global society. The political, social and economic implications extend beyond China's borders, considering the interconnectedness of today's world. As we continue to foster integrity and fairness within the global political landscape, these types of connections must be investigated further. Conclusion: Looking Forward While these revelations of connections between offshore firms and Chinese political families may be disconcerting, it is an opportunity to spark dialogues about transparency and accountability in the political world. It should serve as a wake-up call for political systems globally, to rigorously examine, regulate and monitor offshore businesses linked to political families. The focus should move from secrecy to openness, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, for the creation of a just and equitable world. In Step by Step Interpretation: The article systematically breaks down the summary into different segments that focuses on various aspects of the situation. The introduction grabs attention by revealing the main point. Then the article continues to explain why it matters, detailing the findings while putting them into a broader context. The third paragraph talks about the bigger picture, emphasizing that not all offshore businesses are illegitimate, but it becomes a problem when they are linked to political leaders and could potentially affect their decisions. The article ends with some concluding thoughts about the need for transparency and accountability. It works to deepen the reader's understanding of the issue and its importance, while also striving to remain fair and balanced in its viewpoint."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment we walked in, we were captivated by the warm and welcoming ambiance enhanced by the soft, romantic lighting and tasteful decor. The hostess greeted us with a cheerful smile and promptly escorted us to our reserved table. Immediately, we noted the meticulous attention to detail and cleanliness, with neatly set tables adorned by glistening silverware and sparkling glasses. One major aspect of our experience that I must bring attention to is the phenomenal service we received. Our server, Sarah, was the epitome of professionalism and friendliness. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made thoughtful recommendations based on our preferences. Her timely attentiveness allowed us to never feel rushed while also being promptly attended to. The Gourmet Bistro's menu is a delightful treasure trove of innovative culinary creations, each featuring fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. As a starter, we shared the cheese sampler platter, which showcased a selection of artisanal cheeses, homemade jam, and perfectly baked bread. The harmony of flavors and textures left us excited for the dishes to come. On Sarah's recommendation, I chose the Stuffed Chicken Roulade as a main course. It was nothing short of phenomenal – the chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender, while the accompanying porcini mushroom risotto proved to be rich, creamy, and incredibly satisfying. My partner had the Grilled Salmon, which was cooked to perfection and topped with a zesty herbed butter. The combination of flavors was unbelievable as the dish was accentuated with a well-balanced side of roasted seasonal vegetables. As a dessert lover, I could not pass up the opportunity to try their signature Chocolate Lava Cake. The presentation was stunning, and the taste was even better. The cake had a beautiful, gooey center that paired exquisitely with the silky vanilla bean ice cream on the side. My partner opted for the Lemon Raspberry Tart, which was tangy, zesty, and refreshing. It was a fitting end to a delightful meal. We rounded off our evening with a well-crafted cocktail from their extensive drinks menu, which further reinforced The Gourmet Bistro's commitment to excellence. Even as the restaurant started to fill up throughout the evening, the noise level remained comfortable, allowing for easy conversation and an overall pleasant dining environment. In conclusion, The Gourmet Bistro exceeded our expectations and truly delivered an outstanding dining experience that we will not forget. From the delectable dishes and attentive service to the beautiful atmosphere, it is clear that this restaurant is a cut above the rest.

The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film \\"Jawab'(1985) too. The problem here is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) or an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of his-Pukar (2000) and Lajja(2001), this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise, as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of his protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee\\" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all, there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre, newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. I am facing a new situation today: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more at risk of experiencing hearing loss due to the sounds they encounter frequently? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the situation presented, Jeremy, who works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine, is more at risk of experiencing hearing loss due to the sounds he encounters frequently. The background article detailed how decibel levels relate to a sound's intensity and how it affects our hearing. According to this information, as decibel levels increase, the intensity of sound increases. This means that sounds are louder with each 10-decibel increase, at a magnitude 10 times greater. Moreover, the article also highlighted that high-decibel sounds are dangerous, contributing to ear damage and potential hearing loss. In our new situation, Jeremy is the one frequently exposed to high-decibel sounds because of his work in a construction site. Construction sites are generally very noisy due to the various machines and tools in operation. Some of the loudest tools, such as a jackhammer and a large welding machine, which Jeremy uses, are known to create high decibel sound levels. Prolonged exposure to such high-intensity sounds without proper hearing protection can indeed result in ear damage and gradual loss of hearing. Meanwhile, Alexander, who works in a library, is exposed to low-decibel sounds. Libraries are generally quiet spaces, symbolizing silence and tranquility. The amount of sound in libraries falls into the lower range of the decibel scale. Thus, Alexander is not exposed to high-decibel, high-intensity sounds that could potentially cause hearing loss. Summarily, based on the information about decibel levels and the sound intensity they denote, Jeremy is more at risk of experiencing hearing loss due to his frequent exposure to high-decibel level sounds at his workplace, the construction site. To minimize risk, Jeremy should consider using appropriate hearing protection devices such as earmuffs or earplugs to attenuate the intensity of sounds reaching his ears, thereby reducing potential damage to his hearing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby told the BBC's Songs Of Praise the killings had put a \\"chink in his armour\\". He said his reaction to the attacks had been \\"first shock and horror and then a profound sadness\\", heightened because he and his wife once lived in Paris. The gun and suicide bomb attacks on 13 November, carried out by so-called Islamic State, left 130 people dead. Prime Minister David Cameron will meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday to discuss the fight against terror. They will discuss how to co-operate on counter-terrorism and in the fight against IS in Syria and Iraq, UK officials said. The archbishop said: \\"Saturday morning, I was out and as I was walking, I was praying and saying: 'God, why - why is this happening? Where are you in all this?'\\" \\"He said 'in the middle of it' and also in answer from Psalm 56 - 'he stores up our tears in a bottle, none of our sufferings are lost,'\\" he added. The archbishop said his shock had been made worse because he and his wife had lived in Paris for five years. \\"It was one of the happiest places we have lived and to think of a place of such celebration of life seeing such suffering is utterly heart-breaking.\\" A bombing campaign against IS, particularly by French air forces, was launched in Syria shortly after the attack, but the archbishop warned against a potentially damaging instant reaction. \\"Two injustices do not make justice. If we start randomly killing those who have not done wrong, that is not going to provide solutions. So governments have to be the means of justice,\\" he said. Archbishop Welby also said the way IS militants had perverted their faith in order to believe their acts glorified their God, was \\"one of the most desperate aspects of our world today\\". Cardinal Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, told the programme it had taken him \\"quite a while\\" to come to terms with what had happened in Paris. He said terrorists wanted to make people live in fear, breed hatred and strike divisions in society - but people had to try to resist this. The terrorists' actions, he said, were a blasphemy against God, but had shown \\"the goodness of people\\" in Paris, quoting a newspaper which said: \\"Terrorists came to shed blood; Parisians stood in line to give blood.\\" \\"We really should be solid in our commitment to each other - to stand in the face of this evil,\\" the cardinal said. Strong action was needed but political and military judgement was required to decide how best to stop them, he added. Songs of Praise will be shown on BBC One at 16:15 GMT on 22 November, and on BBC iPlayer.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? car is owned by somebody named aikman Pick your answer from: - Yes. - It's impossible to say. - No.","completion":"No. The sentence \\"car is owned by somebody named aikman\\" does not follow the preceding text because it does not provide any additional information or context related to dehumidifying a car. Instead, it introduces an unrelated detail about the car's owner. The main topic, which is about dehumidifying a car, should be further elaborated with steps and methods to achieve it. Here's an example of a detailed and long answer on how to dehumidify a car: 1. Remove excess water: If there is standing water in the car, use a wet/dry vacuum to extract as much water as possible. Make sure to vacuum all areas prone to moisture accumulation, such as under the seats, floor mats, and carpets. 2. Air out the car: Open all car doors and windows to allow airflow inside the car. Using fans to facilitate air circulation can help in drying the interior more quickly. 3. Remove any wet or damp items: Remove all wet items, such as floor mats and seat covers, to dry separately. This will prevent them from retaining moisture inside the car. 4. Use moisture-absorbing products: There are products available on the market specifically designed to absorb moisture, such as silica gel packets and moisture-absorbing bags. Place these products strategically in your car, particularly in areas where there's a higher chance of moisture retention. 5. Use a dehumidifier: If the dampness in the car is pervasive, consider using a portable dehumidifier. Place the dehumidifier inside the car for a couple of hours or overnight to extract the moisture. Remember to empty the collected water from the dehumidifier regularly. 6. Inspect and clean air conditioning vents: If there is condensation or moisture buildup in the air conditioning vents, it can contribute to the humid conditions inside the car. Clean vents thoroughly and replace air conditioning filters if necessary. 7. Check for potential leaks: Inspect the car for any possible leaks that may allow water to enter, such as damaged door and window seals, sunroof issues, or leaks from the car's undercarriage. 8. Regularly maintain your car's interior: To prevent excessive moisture from building up again, regular cleaning and maintenance of the car's interior are essential. Vacuum and wipe down surfaces, check for signs of mold or mildew, and ensure that the car is well-ventilated when parked. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively dehumidify your car, making it more comfortable and safer to drive. Regular maintenance and attention to any potential issues will help prevent future moisture-related problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: If a snake bites you, take a photo with your mobile phone! It save your life. This is the surprising advice of a British cook. One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. \\" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door.\\" Jackson said. Anyway, Jackson was cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Light may be refracted by matter. The light is bent when it passes from one type of matter to another. Refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves. You can also read more about refraction of light in the lesson “Optics. ”. Q: What occurs when light bends as it passes from one type of matter to another? A: Answer:","completion":"When light bends as it passes from one type of matter to another, a phenomenon called refraction occurs. Refraction is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed as it passes from one medium to another. This process is an essential aspect of the behavior of light and wave propagation, and it can be observed in various natural phenomena and practical applications. The bending of light happens because different materials have distinct optical properties, which are characterized by a quantity called the refractive index. The refractive index represents the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the given material. When light passes from a medium with a certain refractive index to a medium with a different refractive index, its speed changes, causing the light wave to change direction. A familiar example of refraction is the apparent bending of a straw when it is placed in a glass of water. This occurs because the speed of light changes as it travels from the air to the water, causing the light to bend and create the illusion of a bent straw. Another example would be the formation of a rainbow, which is caused by the refraction and dispersion of sunlight as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. Refraction is also a critical principle in optical devices and systems, such as lenses, prisms, and fiber optics. In lenses, refraction is utilized to manipulate light and focus it to produce images. For example, in eyeglasses, the lenses are designed to bend light in a way that compensates for the imperfections in the individual's eye, allowing them to see clearly. Likewise, telescopes and microscopes use a combination of lenses to magnify and focus light on objects that are too far away or too small to be observed with the naked eye. In prisms, refraction is used to separate light into its constituent colors or wavelengths. When white light passes through a prism, the different colors of light refract at different angles due to their distinct speeds in the material, resulting in the dispersion of the light and the formation of a spectrum. This principle is employed in various scientific instruments, such as spectrometers, which are used to analyze the composition of substances based on their characteristic spectra. In the field of telecommunications, refraction plays a vital role in the transmission of data through fiber optic cables. These cables consist of long strands of glass or plastic, which function as waveguides for light signals. As the light travels through the cable, it is continuously refracted, allowing it to be directed along the length of the fiber with minimal loss of signal quality and speed. In conclusion, when light bends as it passes from one type of matter to another, the process of refraction takes place. This phenomenon occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it moves between materials with varying refractive indices. Refraction is a fundamental aspect of the behavior of light and is responsible for various natural occurrences and practical applications in optics and telecommunications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they speed across a bridge, the women's car plunges over the side into the river. The police spend three hours dragging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down. In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs in the large house and retreats to her room. Mrs. Thomas, who brings her some food, says she did not pass anyone.

Write a summary based on this article: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story A tiny fraction of the 880,000 doctors and other health care providers who take Medicare accounted for nearly a quarter of the roughly 77 billion paid out to them under the federal program, receiving millions of dollars each in some cases in a single year, according to the most detailed data ever released in Medicare’s nearly 50-year history. In 2012, 100 doctors received a total of 610 million, ranging from a Florida ophthalmologist who was paid 21 million by Medicare to dozens of doctors, eye and cancer specialists chief among them, who received more than 4 million each that year. While more money by far is spent for routine office visits than any other single expenditure, one of the most heavily reimbursed procedures — costing a total of 1 billion for 143,000 patients — is for a single treatment for an eye disorder common in the elderly. The Medicare data — all for 2012 and the subject of an intense legal battle — provides an unprecedented look at the practice of medicine across the country, shedding fresh light on the treatment decisions physicians and other practitioners make every day. It will also provide consumers with an ability to compare doctors and treatments in a way they have never had until now. Fraud investigators, health insurance plans, researchers and others will spend weeks poring over the information about how many tests were ordered and procedures performed for every provider who received Medicare payments under Part B, which excludes payments to hospitals and other institutions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is making the data publicly available on Wednesday. While total Medicare spending — including hospitals, doctors and drugs — is approaching 600 billion a year, payments to individual doctors have long been shrouded in secrecy. For decades, the American Medical Association, the powerful doctors’ group, and others have blocked the release of the information, citing privacy concerns and the potential for misuse of the information. But a federal judge ruled last year that the information could be made public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Medicare paid 12 billion for 214 million office and outpatient visits, most of them described as between 15 and 25 minutes long. The practitioners — usually doctors, but sometimes nurse practitioners, were paid an average of 57 a visit. Much of Medicare spending is concentrated among a small fraction of doctors. About 2 percent of doctors account for about 15 billion in Medicare payments, roughly a quarter of the total, according an analysis of the data by The New York Times. These figures exclude commercial entities like clinical laboratories and ambulance services, which account for 13.5 billion of the 77 billion total. Only a quarter of the doctors are responsible for three-quarters of the spending. Medicare provided The New York Times with an advance look at the information but requested that individual doctors not be contacted until the data was made public. A database, searchable by doctors’ names, is available at nytimes.com. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is actually the most useful data set that Medicare has ever released,” said Dr. Bob Kocher, who served in the Obama administration and is now a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm. People will be able to see just how many elbow surgeries a given orthopedic surgeon has performed on Medicare patients, he said, and they will be able to better judge a doctor’s style of practice, for example, whether a CT scan is performed on every patient or only rarely. “You’re going to see variation,” he said.

This gives us no window into quality or anything of that nature.” While patients may know who performs a high number of procedures, like hip replacements, for example, they will not be able to tell anything about whether the patients needed the surgery or whether they benefited from the surgery. What’s more, Dr. Hoven cautioned, doctors were not able to review the data, and some of the information being made public could be wrong. But the release of the information is likely to increase attention to particularly controversial areas of spending. About 3,300 ophthalmologists, for example, were paid a total of 3.3 billion from Medicare, according to the Times analysis. Much of the spending was the result of an expensive and frequent treatment for a kind of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly, and the cost of the drug is factored into the payments doctors receive. Ranibizumab, known by the brand name Lucentis, is injected into the eye as often as once a month. A cancer drug that is used as an alternative can cost much less. Other specialists also account for large portions of Medicare spending. Fewer than 1,000 radiation oncologists, for example, received payments totaling 1.1 billion.

Grover, a lawyer who represents whistle-blowers who sue doctors and hospitals who they claim have committed fraud against the Medicare program. “There’s going to be a lot of litigation over this,” he said. The Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, which serves as a federal watchdog on fraud and abuse for the agency, released a report in December recommending greater scrutiny of those physicians who were Medicare’s highest billers. The report recommended that Medicare establish a threshold to look more closely at the high billers. Regulators have also said they are scrutinizing the use of high-paying codes in places including the emergency room. Health insurance companies, which must now rely on only the claims they handle to look at doctors, are also likely to find the information valuable, according to Paul B. Ginsburg, a health economist and professor at the University of Southern California. Marrying the Medicare information to their own information, “all of a sudden they have a lot more to work with,” he said, in trying to better determine how an individual doctor treats patients — ordering lots of tests, for example, or being slow to operate. “This is going to be a very important change,” he said. Experts say the data must be used with caution. An individual doctor, for example, may seem to have a high volume of services because that doctor oversees medical residents or physician assistants but bills for those services. Medicare patients may be only a fraction of the patients a doctor sees. Despite its limitations, however, policy experts largely praised the release of the information, arguing that this was an important step to understanding how doctors practice medicine in this country. “Any time Medicare releases a lot of data, it changes the conversation in America about transparency, about cost and quality,” said François de Brantes, the executive director of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute. “It’s more a signal from Medicare to market,” he said. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — Medicare paid a tiny group of doctors 3 million or more apiece in 2012. One got nearly 21 million. FILE - This Jan. 31, 2010, file image released by Miami Dade College shows Dr. Salomon Melgen, posing for a photo at the book signing of \\"Growing American Roots\\", a book by Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.,... (Associated Press) Those are among the findings of an Associated Press analysis of physician data released Wednesday by the Obama administration, part of a move to open the books on health care financing. Topping Medicare's list was Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, whose relationship with Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., made headlines last year after news broke that the lawmaker used the doctor's personal jet for trips to the Dominican Republic. Medicare paid Melgen 20.8 million. AP's analysis found that a small sliver of the more than 825,000 individual physicians in Medicare's claims data base — just 344 physicians — took in top dollar, at least 3 million apiece for a total of nearly 1.5 billion. AP picked the 3 million threshold because that was the figure used by the Health and Human Services inspector general in an audit last year that recommended Medicare automatically scrutinize total billings above a set level. Medicare says it's working on that recommendation. About 1 in 4 of the top-paid doctors — 87 of them — practice in Florida, a state known both for high Medicare spending and widespread fraud. Rounding out the top five states were California with 38 doctors in the top group, New Jersey with 27, Texas with 23, and New York with 18. In the 3 million-plus club, 151 ophthalmologists — eye specialists — accounted for nearly 658 million in Medicare payments, leading other disciplines. Cancer doctors rounded out the top four specialty groups, accounting for a combined total of more than 477 million in payments. Overall, Medicare paid individual physicians nearly 64 billion in 2012. The median payment — the point at which half the amounts are higher and half are lower — was 30,265. AP's analysis focused on individual physicians, excluding about 55,000 organizations that also appear in the database, such as ambulance services. None of those entities was paid 3 million or more. The Medicare claims database is considered the richest trove of information on doctors, surpassing what major insurance companies have in their files. Although Medicare is financed by taxpayers, the data have been off limits to the public for decades. Physician organizations went to court to block its release, arguing it would amount to an invasion of doctors' privacy. Employers, insurers, consumer groups and media organizations pressed for release. Together with other sources of information, they argued that the data could help guide patients to doctors who provide quality, cost-effective care. A federal judge last year lifted the main legal obstacle to release, and the Obama administration recently informed the American Medical Association it would open up the claims data. \\"It will allow us to start putting the pieces together,\\" said Dianne Munevar, a top researcher at the health care data firm Avalare Health. \\"That is the basis of what payment delivery reform is about.\\" Doctors' decision-making patterns are of intense interest to researchers who study what drives the nation's 2.8-trillion-a-year health care system. Within the system, physicians act as the main representatives of patients, and their decisions about how to treat determine spending. The American Medical Association, which has long opposed release of the Medicare database, is warning it will do more harm than good. The AMA says the files may contain inaccurate information. And even if the payment amounts are correct, the AMA says they do not provide meaningful insights into the quality of care. \\"We believe that the broad data dump ... has significant shortcomings regarding the accuracy and value of the medical services rendered by physicians,\\" AMA president Ardis Dee Hoven said. \\"Releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies, misinterpretations, false conclusions and other unintended consequences.\\" The AMA had asked the government to allow individual doctors to review their information prior to its release. Over time, as researchers learn to mine the Medicare data, it could change the way medicine is practiced in the U.S. Doctor ratings, often based on the opinions of other physicians, would be driven by hard data, like statistics on baseball players. Consumers could become better educated about the doctors in their communities. For example, if your father is about to undergo heart bypass, you could find out how many operations his surgeon has done in the last year. Research shows that for many procedures, patients are better off going to a surgeon who performs them frequently. The data could also be used to spot fraud, such as doctors billing for seeing more patients in a day than their office could reasonably be expected to care for. Medical practice would have to change to accommodate big data. Acting as intermediaries for employers and government programs, insurers could use the Medicare numbers to demand that low-performing doctors measure up. If the data indicated a particular doctor's diabetic patients were having unusually high rates of complications, that doctor might face questions. Such oversight would probably accelerate trends toward large medical groups and doctors working as employees instead of in small practices. Melgen, the top-paid physician in 2012, has already come under scrutiny. In addition to allowing the use of his jet, the eye specialist was the top political donor for Menendez as the New Jersey Democrat sought re-election to the Senate that year. Menendez's relationship with Melgen prompted Senate Ethics and Justice Department investigations. Menendez reimbursed Melgen more than 70,000 for plane trips. The issue exploded in late January 2013, after the FBI conducted a search of Melgen's West Palm Beach offices. Agents carted away evidence, but law enforcement officials have refused to say why. Authorities declined to comment on the open investigation. ___ Associated Press writer Kelli Kennedy in Miami contributed to this report. ||||| The Medicare program is the source of a small fortune for many U.S. doctors, according to a trove of government records that reveal unprecedented details about physician billing practices nationwide. The government insurance program for older people paid nearly 4,000 physicians in excess of 1 million each in 2012, according to the new data. Those figures do not include what the doctors billed private insurance firms. The release of the information gives the public access for the first time to the billing practices of individual doctors nationwide. Consumer groups and news outlets have pressured Medicare to release the data for years. And in doing so Wednesday, Medicare officials said they hope the data will expose fraud, inform consumers and lead to improvements in care. The American Medical Association and other physician groups have resisted the data release, arguing that the information violates doctor privacy and that the public may misconstrue details about individual doctors. Among the highest billers were: a cardiologist in Ocala, Fla., who took in 18.1 million, mainly putting in stents; a New Jersey pathologist who received 12.6 million performing tissue exams and other tests; and a Michigan vascular surgeon who got 10.1 million. Some of the highest billing totals may simply reflect a physician who is extremely efficient or who has an unusually large number of Medicare patients. The highest numbers also may reflect a physician who specializes in procedures that require costly overhead, and in those cases, a large portion of the money may wind up not with the doctor but with pharmaceutical companies or makers of medical devices. But in some instances, the extremely high billing totals could signal fraudulent doctor behavior, as government inspectors have previously found. Indeed, three of the top 10 earners already had drawn scrutiny from the federal government, and one of them is awaiting trial on federal fraud charges. The greatest tallies also may signal that the Medicare payments for some procedures are too high for the amount of work involved or that perverse incentives lead doctors to overuse a procedure. The specialties most common at the top ranks of the Medicare payments were ophthalmologists, oncologists and pathologists. This information gives the public “unprecedented access to information about the number and type of health-care services” doctors provided during the year, Jonathan Blum, principal deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a blog post. The Medicare program is the nation’s largest medical insurer. By virtue of its breadth, the forthcoming billing data are expected to shed light on an array of questions that have arisen about health-care costs as the nation has confronted decades of rising medical bills. Overall, the data cover 77 billion in billing involving 880,000 practitioners in 2012. The AMA has warned that the data could contain errors, and in some cases, one doctor’s billing number may have been used by multiple support personnel for billing purposes. In addition, the billing figures reflect what a doctor receives in payment but does not show the actual profit after paying for equipment, support personnel and malpractice insurance. For some procedures, the overhead can reach three-quarters or more of the payment amount. Many of the highest billers, for example, were in fields with unusually high expenses, and that was likely to limit their personal share of the money. Using the assumptions that Medicare and the AMA make when setting payment rates, only 23 of the 4,000 biggest billers personally earned 1 million or more, according to a Washington Post analysis. Gerald Ho, 50, a rheumatologist who runs three offices in the Los Angeles area, said he had been “sort of dreading” the release of the Medicare payment data. Ho received nearly 5.4 million in reimbursements in 2012. Of that, he said, probably about 5 million covered the cost of genetically-engineered drugs to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. He also has to pay a staff of 40. “People are going to see these numbers and people aren’t going to understand,” he said. “I am not pocketing 5.3 million. To tell you the truth, I know there’s been lot of Medicare fraud, and I understand the government wants to provide a measure of transparency. But when they throw out numbers like this without any context, it’s going to be misconstrued by the public.” “The AMA is concerned that CMS’ broad approach to releasing physician payment data will mislead the public into making inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment decisions and will result in unwarranted bias against physicians that can destroy careers,” Ardis Dee Hoven, president of the AMA, said in a statement. “We have witnessed these inaccuracies in the past.” But consumer and public interest groups argued that the information will help consumers make better decisions. “This data is important because it will make it possible for consumers to identify physicians that will best meet their needs,” said Robert Krughoff, president of Consumers’ Checkbook, a group that began seeking the release of this information in 2005 and eventually sued for it. For example, it will allow consumers to know which doctors are most experienced in a given operation. Studies have shown that in several types of surgery, volume matters: Surgeries by doctors who have performed the procedure enough times are less likely to end with the patient’s death. As for the potential that the data might misrepresent a physician’s practice, Krughoff said, “The consumer organizations that have pushed for release of this information have a strong obligation to make sure that the information is used properly. But I believe in the marketplace of ideas.” Opting for expensive The doctor at the top of the list of largest Medicare billers is Salomon Melgen, an ophthalmologist in West Palm Beach, Fla., who took in 20 million from Medicare in 2012, according to the data released Wednesday. Most of Melgen’s take — about 11.8 million of it — came from injecting patients’ eyes with Lucentis, a drug used for macular degeneration, according to the data. For each shot, Medicare and the patient pay a doctor about 2,000, but the drug is very expensive and the doctor must then pay most of that money to the drug’s manufacturer, Genentech. What may be most interesting about Melgen’s practice, however, is that he could have used a much cheaper drug than Lucentis — one called Avastin that many ophthalmologists consider an equivalent. Had he used the cheaper alternative, his bill to Medicare for the shots would have dropped from 11.8 million to less than 500,000. But physicians have a financial incentive to use more expensive drugs. Medicare pays a doctor more for injecting the more expensive drug — the physician’s fee is based on the drug’s price — and Genentech offered doctors its own incentive to use the expensive drug: The firm gave discounts to those who use high volumes. Melgen’s name appeared in headlines in 2012 as result of his connection to Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), a friend who received campaign contributions from the ophthalmologist. Menendez has been accused of improperly raising concerns with federal health officials on his behalf. Melgen’s attorney issued a statement before the data release to try to put his client’s billing in perspective. “At all times, Dr. Melgen billed in conformity with Medicare rules,” Kirk Ogrosky said. “While the amounts in the CMS data release appear large, the vast majority reflects the cost of drugs. . . . Responsible analysis requires looking beyond the raw data to what was paid for pharmaceuticals and expenses.” The use of the more expensive eye drug helps explain why so many of Medicare’s top billers are ophthalmologists. Of the doctors who were paid at least 1 million by Medicare in 2012, 879 were ophthalmologists, who — like Melgen — relied on using the more expensive drug, Lucentis. Some physicians have suggested that using Lucentis is wasteful because a much cheaper alternative exists. “There is no advantage of using Lucentis over Avastin — as six randomized clinical trials have shown they’re equivalent,” said Philip Rosenfeld, a Miami ophthalmologist who has pioneered the use of the less-expensive drug. Top billers Melgen, like some other doctors among the top billers, already has drawn scrutiny from Medicare investigators. Indeed, government inspectors have noted that instances of billing disputes and potential fraud may occur more frequently among the highest Medicare billers. A December report from the Department of Health and Human Services, for example, analyzed the records of 303 physicians who were paid more than 3 million by Medicare in a year. It found that 13 were responsible for overpayments totaling 34 million, six faced payment reviews, three had their licenses suspended and two were indicted. In releasing the data, Medicare officials forbade news outlets to share any of the data until 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. This provision meant that reporters could not solicit responses from any doctors beforehand. The second-highest biller in 2012 was Asad U. Qamar, a cardiologist in Ocala. Qamar made headlines last year after a Reuters report detailed large donations the doctor had made to the Obama administration’s agenda and a detailed federal review of his billing practices. He told Reuters that he had seen “tremendous harassment of the physician community.” The seventh-highest biller is Farid Fata, a cancer doctor in the Detroit area. He received 10 million in Medicare payments in 2012. Fata was arrested in August and is awaiting trial in a Medicare fraud case, accused of intentionally misdiagnosing illnesses and ordering unnecessary treatments, including chemotherapy for patients who did not have cancer. Federal authorities say that Fata, who owned and operated two health-care companies, fraudulently billed Medicare from August 2007 to July 2013. He also is accused of conspiracy to pay and receive kickbacks to providers of home health services and hospice services in return for referring patients. He has denied any wrongdoing. Not all of the highest billers have faced such scrutiny, however. The fourth-highest biller on the list is a department chairman at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Doctors Respond Several physicians worried the data release would mislead the public. The database, for instance, lists Minh Nguyen, a hematologist-oncologist at Orange Coast Oncology in Newport Beach, Calif., as having received more than 9 million in reimbursements, ranking him as number 10 on the list of top billers of Medicare in 2012. Nyugen explained the high total was because all the chemotherapy drugs for his five-physician practice are billed under his name. “It looks like I’m getting paid 9 million. . . but it’s a pass through,” he said. “The majority of the billing goes to pay the drug companies.” Nguyen said the data could illuminate the challenge experienced by oncologists around the country who are struggling with rising drug costs. Typically, the practice must purchase drugs up front – at a cost of about 25,000 per treatment – and then wait weeks or months for Medicare or insurance companies to reimburse them. Jean Malouin, a family practitioner in Ann Arbor, Mich., said her perch at number 16 of top billers was because she was the medical director of an experimental University of Michigan initiative that sought to improve care and cost-efficiency at nearly 400 clinics across the state. Due to the project, Medicare paid out 7.6 million to her for work done with more than 200,000 patients. \\"I am most definitely not a high volume Medicare biller,\\" she said. “I am one of the ‘good guys’ trying to save [Medicare] money.” Franklin Cockerill, with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is number 4 on the list with 11,068,463 in reimbursements. As the government-required director for Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Cockerill is routinely listed as the billing physician on more than 23 million tests a year, a Mayo spokesman explained. “When anything is billed out to Medicare, it will have Dr. Cockerill’s name on it,” said Andy Tofilon, Marketing Administrator with Mayo Medical Laboratories. “He is the chair of a large laboratory medicine practice and the buck stops at his desk.” Cockerill is salaried and has “no financial stake by being included in all of these reports,” Tofilon said. Tofilon said the number of tests billed through Mayo Clinic Laboratories is especially large because the vast majority of the clinic’s testing is done in Rochester. Other labs, he noted, often have locations scattered across the country. Answering questions The data release is expected to answer a much broader array of questions than who billed the most. One of the persistent mysteries of U.S. health care, for example, is why some surgeries are performed much more frequently in some areas of the country than in others, as researchers at Dartmouth College noted. Why, for example, is the rate of bypass surgery more than five times as high around Hattiesburg , Miss., and Slidell, La., as it is in Grand Junction, Colo.? Why is the rate of heart-valve replacement in Paterson and Camden, N.J., more than twice that of New Orleans and Albuquerque? The data may allow researchers to take a closer look at individual doctors to find answers. Jonathan S. Skinner, a Dartmouth economist, acknowledged that some doctors “may feel that their privacy has been compromised” with the dissemination of their billing records. But, he said, “as earlier reporting has shown, there are people who are operating in the gray area of health care who are causing Medicare to spend enormous amounts on health care that may be harmful to their patients.” Amy Brittain, Alice Crites, David S. Fallis, Carol D. Leonnig, Steven Rich and Sandhya Somashekhar contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"In 2012, Medicare, a government insurance program for older people, paid almost 4,000 doctors in the United States more than 1 million each.

And writer Liel Leibovitz says the students are following an example that began in the eighteen seventies. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, \\"Fortunate Sons.\\" The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys from 1872 to 1875 to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country. Mr. Leibovitz got the idea for the book about the boys a few years ago when he was traveling with his wife in China. Mr. Leibovitz learned that Qing government sent a whole delegation of boys to learn the ways of the West. The goal was for them to return to China and help their country. The book says the boys received their American training in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It must have been a very good education. Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them. Their notebooks, journals, letters and postcards were in English. Mr. Leibovitz said he was lucky to have so much information from events that took place long ago. The students returned to China after about nine years. They no longer spoke Mandarin well enough to answer questions. Police welcomed them home by putting them in jail.

A billion-dollar oil company, headed by Sumner Murdock, sets forth on an exploration project in the North Pole that is recommended and managed by Michael Baldwin. The film opens with several dynamite blasts to break up the ice that's clogging up the deep-sea drilling rigs. Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia. On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results. The next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus's chief elf Ed. Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves. He explains that while their activities at \\"Site A\\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \\"Site B\\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.

Co tu dělám? Which language is this?","completion":"This is the Czech language. The sentence \\"Co tu dělám?\\" can be translated into English as \\"What am I doing here?\\". The Czech language is a West Slavic language and is the official language of the Czech Republic. It is spoken by approximately 10 million people mainly in the Czech Republic, but also by some Czech communities worldwide. Czech is closely related to Slovak, another West Slavic language, and the two are mutually intelligible to a significant extent. Before the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech and Slovak languages had more similarities that resulted from the standardization process common for both languages under Czechoslovak rule. Czech language is known for its complicated grammar, richness in sounds, and the heavy use of consonants, including consonant clusters (sequences of consonants with no vowels). This makes the Czech language somewhat challenging for speakers of languages with simpler phonological structures. Czech uses the Latin alphabet, which has been expanded with diacritical marks to accommodate the unique sounds found in the Czech language. The alphabet consists of 42 letters, including some special characters such as á, č, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ř, š, ť, ú, ů, ý, ž. The language also features a rich variety of dialects, which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and morphology. The major dialects are: Bohemian (spoken in the western part of the country), Moravian (spoken in the eastern part of the country), and Silesian (spoken in the territory around the city of Ostrava). Czech has a rich literary tradition that can be traced back to the 14th century. One of the most significant writers in Czech literature is the 19th-century author Božena Němcová, who contributed to the development of the Czech National Revival movement. Other prominent writers include Jaroslav Hašek, known for his satirical novel The Good Soldier Švejk, and Franz Kafka, who was born in Prague and wrote in German. In conclusion, the language you've encountered is Czech. It is a West Slavic language with complex grammar and pronunciation, spoken primarily in the Czech Republic.

G5 is a floorless dive coaster designed and manufactured by the renowned Swiss roller coaster designers Bolliger & Mabillard. It was built in Janfusun Fancyworld, an amusement park located in the Gukeng Township in Yunlin County, Taiwan. The G5 was introduced to the public on June 9, 2000. As the second dive coaster ever built, it followed the blueprint of Oblivion, which was the world's first dive coaster situated at Alton Towers theme park resort in Staffordshire, England. Dive coasters are a unique type of roller coaster featuring steep drops with a near-vertical angle, usually around 90 degrees or more. They are characterized by their large trains with wide rows of seating and the distinctive \\"pause\\" at the edge of the drop, which increases the anticipation and thrill for riders before they plunge down the descent. The train moves slowly over the edge, giving riders a breathtaking view before they experience the thrilling free fall. Oblivion, the first dive coaster, was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard and opened in 1998 at Alton Towers, Staffordshire, England. It immediately gained attention for its staggering height of 65 feet and a vertical drop of 180 feet into a tunnel. The success of Oblivion paved the way for the construction of G5 at Janfusun Fancyworld in Taiwan. G5 features a floorless design, meaning that riders' legs dangle freely above the track without any floor beneath them. This intensifies the experience of weightlessness and provides a more thrilling sensation throughout the ride. G5 has a total length of 3,609 feet, a maximum height of 161 feet, and a maximum drop of 157 feet. It reaches speeds of up to 67 miles per hour and has a ride duration of approximately 2 minutes and 20 seconds. The track consists of various elements, including a 90-degree drop, a massive Immelmann inversion, and a vertical loop. In summary, the G5, built by Swiss manufacturers Bolliger & Mabillard in 2000 at Janfusun Fancyworld in Taiwan, is the second dive coaster model to be constructed after the first dive coaster, Oblivion, which is located at the Alton Towers theme park resort in Staffordshire, England. The G5 is characterized by its floorless design, thrilling 90-degree drop, and a combination of inversions, making it a popular attraction for thrill-seekers worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer. The baby then playfully bonks Tom on the head.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \\"the greenhouse effect\\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change.

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire.

The statement provided, \\"The writer Jez Butterworth also worked on the script, alongside Mendes and Craig.\\" is not a good answer to the question regarding the number of Bond films Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have worked on. Instead, a detailed and long answer emphasizing their collaboration on Bond films should be given. Detailed Answer: Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, the British screenwriting duo, have been involved in the scripting of several James Bond films, contributing significantly to the Bond cinematic universe. They have been a part of the Bond franchise since 1999 and have had a hand in writing scripts for a total of seven Bond films as of now. Their collaboration began with the movie \\"The World is Not Enough,\\" releasing in 1999. Over the years, they have contributed to the following Bond films: 1. The World is Not Enough (1999) 2. Die Another Day (2002) 3. Casino Royale (2006) 4. Quantum of Solace (2008) 5. Skyfall (2012) 6. Spectre (2015) 7. No Time To Die (2021) Concerning the second part of the statement, Jez Butterworth, an English playwright and screenwriter, has also been involved with the Bond movies, albeit to a lesser extent than the duo of Purvis and Wade. Butterworth contributed to the scriptwriting of the Bond movies \\"Spectre\\" and \\"No Time To Die.\\" Alongside the director Sam Mendes, and with contributions from the action star Daniel Craig himself, Butterworth helped enhance elements of the Bond franchise, adding a fresh perspective to the storytelling. In conclusion, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have been instrumental in shaping the modern James Bond films, having worked on seven Bond movies in total. And although Jez Butterworth has also been involved in the series, his role has been limited to the two most recent films – \\"Spectre\\" and \\"No Time To Die.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: - Sunlight is gathered by the leaves of the plant - The sunlight is broken down into glucose through photosynthesis - The glucose travels the plant - The plant uses that glucose as energy to grow. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process involving the conversion of sunlight into energy for plant growth is the absorption of sunlight by the chlorophyll molecules present within the plant's leaves. This step is crucial as it initiates the complex sequence of photosynthesis, which ultimately generates glucose for plant growth and development. In this initial step, plants utilize specialized organelles called chloroplasts located in their leaf cells. The chloroplasts are abundant within the mesophyll cells of the leaf, and they contain chlorophyll pigments, which capture and absorb sunlight. These pigments come in varying forms, including chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and numerous accessory pigments such as carotenoids, which are responsible for the vibrant colors seen in plants. When sunlight, comprising a spectrum of light wavelengths, reaches the plant's leaves, these chlorophyll pigments get excited by absorbing specific wavelengths, primarily in the blue and red regions of the light spectrum. The absorbed energy promotes the electrons in the chlorophyll molecules to a higher energy state. This excited state is unstable, and the chlorophyll molecule quickly releases the excess energy, either by emitting fluorescence or by transferring the energy to another molecule. In the process of photosynthesis, the energy captured by the chlorophyll molecules is transferred to a complex network of molecules known as the photosystem, which are embedded within the chloroplast's thylakoid membranes. The two main photosystems involved in photosynthesis are Photosystem II (PS II) and Photosystem I (PS I). The transfer of energy from chlorophyll molecules to the photosystems sets off a sequential series of light-dependent reactions, resulting in the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are high-energy molecules. These molecules then participate in a separate set of light-independent reactions called the Calvin-Benson cycle, also known as the dark reactions or carbon fixation. In this cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is utilized to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6), which serves as an energy source for the plant's vital processes, such as growth, reproduction, and cellular respiration. In conclusion, the first step in the process of converting sunlight into energy for plant growth is the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll pigments within the leaves. This initiates the complex series of reactions in photosynthesis, ultimately leading to the production of glucose as an energy source for the plant's metabolic activities and growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: What ingredients do I need to make no churn oreo ice cream?","completion":"To make no churn Oreo ice cream, you will need the following ingredients: 1. Heavy Cream: Heavy cream forms the base of your ice cream and is responsible for the smooth, creamy texture. You will need around 2 cups of it. High fat content provides a rich and creamy texture to your ice cream. 2. Sweetened Condensed Milk: This ingredient will maintain the creaminess and add sweetness to your ice cream. Get a small tin which usually contains around 1 can or 14 ounces. 3. Vanilla Extract: It varies according to taste, but usually, about a teaspoon is enough. Vanilla extract will enhance the flavor of the ice cream and make it more delicious. 4. Oreo cookies: The flavor hero of our ice cream! You will need around 15-20 Oreo cookies. Use regular Oreos for the best flavor. You'll want to crush these up to mix into your ice cream. Depending on your personal preference, you can crush them finely or leave larger chunks for more texture. 5. Salt: A pinch of salt is optional and if used, it will help to balance out the sweetness of the ice cream. Now let's look at how to make your no churn Oreo ice cream, using these ingredients: 1. Begin by whipping your heavy cream. Use a mixer to beat the cream until it forms stiff peaks. This should take about 3-4 minutes. 2. Next, fold in the sweetened condensed milk. Be gentle during this step to maintain the fluffy texture of your whipped cream. 3. Stir in the vanilla extract and the salt, if you're using it. This will add depth to the flavor of the ice cream. 4. Now it's time to add your crushed Oreos. You can crush them in a food processor or put them into a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to break them up. 5. Mix the cookies thoroughly into your cream mixture. You might want to reserve a few pieces to sprinkle on top of the ice cream for decoration. 6. Once your mixture is ready, pour it into a large receptacle or ice cream container. A loaf pan or airtight container works well. 7. Sprinkle the remaining Oreos on top and cover the container. 8. Freeze the ice cream for at least 6 hours, or better yet, overnight. This no churn Oreo ice cream is a great and easy way to enjoy homemade ice cream at any time of the year, without the need for an ice cream maker.

Learning sign language was harder for the boy than learning to play music. The Choose from: a. sign language just baffled him.. b. music just baffled him..","completion":"a. sign language just baffled him. Every day after school, the boy would spend countless hours practicing sign language, determined to master it. He felt that his fingers, instead of flowing gracefully like other signers he had seen, were clumsy and unresponsive. This was quite a stark contrast from the ease with which he was able to pick up musical instruments. In fact, music almost seemed to come naturally to him. Yet, he persisted with his lessons, driven by his desire to communicate better with his new friend, Jake, who was deaf. Step 1: Observe the differences between music and sign language The boy thought it might be useful to pinpoint the differences between learning music and sign language, hoping that this could help him find a way to bridge the gap between the two. He observed that with music, the primary focus was auditory: he could hear the melody and rhythm clearly in his head even when he wasn't playing. By contrast, sign language was purely visual, requiring finely-tuned motor skills and the ability to convey meaning with gestures. Step 2: Drawing similarities between the two In order to improve his sign language skills, the boy decided to draw any similarities between both disciplines. He began to consider rhythm, timing, and the way his fingers and hands moved when playing an instrument. In essence, he viewed sign language as another form of \\"music,\\" wherein his hands and fingers were the instruments that created a visual symphony. Step 3: Practice with the mindset of playing music With this new perspective, the boy dedicated himself to practicing sign language even more, treating each gesture as if he were playing a note on an instrument. He paid close attention to the smoothness, fluidity, and accuracy of his hand movements, much like how he would with a musical piece. He even started to practice in front of a mirror to get visual feedback and improve his technique, just as he had done with playing music. Step 4: Reach out to others for guidance The boy reached out to his deaf friend Jake and some other skilled sign language users for advice, asking them to watch his progress and provide suggestions for improvement. They shared their own experiences and struggles while learning sign language and provided him with valuable tips and encouragement. This helped the boy build confidence in his ability to learn sign language and stay committed to his goal. Step 5: Celebrate progress and encourage further learning Gradually, the boy's sign language skills improved, fueled by his relentless practice and determination. He became more comfortable and adept at using his hands to express himself effectively. He celebrated these small victories by sharing his achievements with Jake, who could now communicate with him more easily. This progress only served to motivate the boy even more, pushing him to continue refining his sign language abilities. Seeing how the ability to communicate through sign language deeply impacted the boy's relationships and everyday life, he finally understood that both music and sign language had their own beauty and rewards. He cherished the skills he had developed and vowed never to stop growing and learning, embracing the challenges and joys that came with being a student of both music and sign language."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q: Q: What is the name for the study of the plants and animals that live in fresh water bodies ? A: Choose your answer from: (I). nematology (II). oceanography (III). hydrology (IV). limnology The answer is:","completion":"(IV). Limnology. Limnology is the scientific study of the physical, chemical, meteorological, and biological aspects of fresh water bodies such as lakes and ponds, as well as streams and rivers. The term limnology comes from the Greek word \\"limne\\", meaning lake, and \\"logos\\", meaning knowledge. While often compared to oceanography, it's not the same. Despite the similarities in the study of the ecosystems and biological interactions in a body of water, the primary difference between them is the nature of the body of water they focus on. Oceanography deals primarily with the study of the world's oceans and seas, whereas limnology is primarily concerned with fresh water bodies. On the other hand, nematology and hydrology are not related to the science of studying life in freshwater bodies either. Nematology is another branch of science, but it focuses on nematodes, a type of roundworm of which there are several thousand varieties. Some are parasitic and harmful to plants and animals, while others are crucial for soil health. Hydrology, meanwhile, is the study of water's properties, distribution, and movement in the earth's crust. It deals with all issues related to water, whether it's a part of the Earth's surface, underground, or in the atmosphere. It's an essential science because it informs water management, predicting and managing floods, droughts, and any environmental problems to ensure a sustainable development. In contrast, limnologists examine the environmental factors affecting life in freshwater bodies, from microbes and plankton to the birds that feed off the animals and plants living there. They also study the effects of human activity, pollution, and climate change on these ecosystems, which directly impacts the health of the planet and the species that depend on it, including us. It is a critical field of study as understanding these freshwater bodies is crucial for managing water resources, fisheries, and understanding environmental changes on a global scale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Lead UK researchers Gerard Bishop (L) and Graham Seymour check plants in a tomato glasshouse at the University of Nottingham March 30, 2012. Lead UK researchers Gerard Bishop (L) and Graham Seymour check plants in a tomato glasshouse at the University of Nottingham March 30, 2012. LONDON An international team of scientists has cracked the genetic code of the domesticated tomato and its wild ancestor, an achievement which should help breeders identify the genes needed to develop tastier and more nutritious varieties. The full genome sequence of a tomato breed known as Heinz 1706, and a draft sequence for its closest wild relative Solanum pimpinellifolium, were published in the journal Nature on Wednesday. Researchers who carried out the work said that together the sequences provide the most detailed look yet at the functional parts of the tomato genome and show order, orientation, types and relative positions of all of its 35,000 genes. The sequences should help researchers find the links between certain tomato genes and the characteristics they determine, and will also extend scientists' understanding of how genetic and environmental factors affect the health of a crop. \\"Tomatoes are one of the most important fruit crops in the world, both in terms of the volume that we eat and the vitamins, minerals and other phytochemicals that both fresh and processed tomato products provide to our diets,\\" said Graham Seymour, a professor of biotechnology at Nottingham University, one of 300 scientists involved in the Tomato Genome Consortium (TGC). TOMATOES ARE NOT THE ONLY FRUIT The tomato is also a good model to investigate the process of fruit ripening, so understanding its genome should help reveal the molecular circuits that make fruits ripen and give them their health-promoting properties, the team said. \\"For any characteristic of the tomato, whether it's taste, natural pest resistance or nutritional content, we've captured virtually all those genes,\\" said James Giovannoni from the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, who was part of the U.S. tomato sequencing team. Tomatoes represent a 2 billion market in the United States alone, while in Britain the market for tomatoes is worth around 625 million pounds (980 million) a year. The research also offers some insight into how the tomato and its relatives diversified and adapted to new environments over the years. The scientists said the findings show the tomato genome expanded abruptly about 60 million years ago. Some of the genes generated during that expansion were involved in the development and control of ripening, making them particularly interesting to tomato breeders. The TGC involved scientists in 14 countries including Argentina, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, Britain, the United States and others. Giovanni said the work has implications for other plant species. Strawberries, apples, melons, bananas and other fleshy fruits share some characteristics with tomatoes, he explained, so knowledge about the genes involved in fruit ripening could potentially be applied to them, helping breeders and growers to improve food quality and cut costs. \\"Now we can start asking a lot more interesting questions about fruit biology, disease resistance, root development and nutritional qualities,\\" he said in a statement. (Editing by Janet Lawrence) ||||| Nik Merkulov / Shutterstock The genome sequence of one of the world’s highest-value salad plants — the tomato — has been decoded by an international team of scientists, and is published today in Nature1 . The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an increasingly popular fruit, with 145.8 million tonnes produced globally in 2010. According to the leaders of the UK arm of the Tomato Genome Consortium, Graham Seymour at the University of Nottingham and Gerard Bishop, formerly of Imperial College London, the sequence will make precision breeding possible not just in tomatoes, but also in other crop species from the Solanaceae family, such as aubergines (Solanum melongena) and peppers (Capsicum spp.). They also hope it will help in the development of tomatoes that can survive pests, pathogens and even climate change, as well as high-yield crops that still have a good flavour. “It’s really all about making a better tomato,” says Allen Van Deynze, a molecular geneticist at the Seed Biotechnology Center at the University of California, Davis. “This work enables a lot of things we just couldn’t do before.” Launched in 2003, the project has taken some time to get results, but it has produced an “amazingly complete” sequence, the leaders say. With more than 80% of the genome sequenced, and more than 90% of the genes within it identified, and refinements still taking place, the group hopes to make this a gold-standard reference sequence. \\"It's one of the better genomes out there,\\" says Van Deynze. Evolving tactics Giovanni Giuliano, from the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development in Rome, and a lead researcher on the project, explains that the group started out using traditional tools to sequence the genomes of the domesticated tomato cultivar Heinz 1706 (the one used to make the famous ketchup) and its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium. However, when the data still had major holes by 2008, the team took advantage of ‘next-generation’ technologies and switched to the much faster method of whole-genome shotgun sequencing. In this technique, large chunks of DNA are sequenced separately, pieced back together, then assembled into the genome. Giuliano says that one of the most exciting discoveries was that the entire tomato genome was copied in triplicate on two separate occasions. The earlier event occurred about 130 million years ago, and was first identified in grapes (Vitis vinifera)2, but what interests Giuliano is that a second event occurred around 60 million years ago, and had major implications for the development of the fruit. “Several of the genes ‘born’ at that second triplication stayed in the genome for tens of millions of years,” he says. “Then, relatively recently, they changed their function — this brought about the appearance of the fleshy fruit as we know it today.” The tomato is already an established model for fleshy fruit development, so the information will also be useful for breeding fruits such as strawberries, melons and bananas. “The next thing,” says Johnathan Napier, a plant biotechnologist at Rothamsted Research in Harpenden, UK, “is to link this genome sequence to traits that are useful and important, especially for food security and human health.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Scientists have discovered the genetic code of tomatoes, which can help breeders create yummier and healthier tomatoes for us to enjoy.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha? Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Answer choices: - an image - vibrations - sunlight - energy - heat energy - an object - motion - heat","completion":"When a mirror reflects photons, it creates an image. The process of reflection involves the interaction of light, or photons, with the surface of the mirror, ultimately leading to the formation of an image. To understand how this works, it is essential to know some basics about light and reflection. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and it behaves both as a wave and as a particle. When considering the interaction of light with objects such as mirrors, we can focus on the particle aspect of light, which we call photons. Photons are tiny packets of energy that travel in a straight line at the speed of light. A mirror, as a reflective surface, is designed to redirect the incoming photons without absorbing much of their energy. It achieves this due to its smooth surface and a thin layer of reflective material, usually silver or aluminum, on the backside of a sheet of glass. When photons coming from an object hit the surface of the mirror, they bounce off or reflect at the same angle with which they arrived. This phenomenon is known as the law of reflection. The photons that are reflected by the mirror follow a specific path determined by their original angle of incidence. These reflected photons then enter our eyes, and our brains process the incoming information to create a mental representation of the image. At this point, we perceive the image as though it were behind the mirror, which is what we refer to as a virtual image. In summary, when a mirror reflects photons, it forms an image due to the law of reflection, where the light particles are deflected at the same angle at which they arrived. This reflection process results in the formation of a virtual image that appears to be behind the mirror, creating a reproduction of the object that emitted or reflected the original photons in the first place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Syria says it has chased rebels from Damascus' Midan neighborhood BEIRUT — Fighting raged for a sixth consecutive day in Damascus, opposition activists said Friday, even as Syria's government declared that it had routed rebels from the capital's Midan district, site of intense battles earlier in the week. , meantime, said as many as 30,000 people had fled from Syria to during the previous 48 hours, many of them fleeing the heaviest fighting to date in Damascus. The unrest in Syria has sent more than 200,000 people into exile — mostly to neighboring Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan — and displaced 1 million residents within Syria, according to U.N. figures and other estimates. Syrian state television said Friday government forces had \\"cleaned\\" the capital's Midan neighborhood of \\"terrorists,\\" the government's customary term for armed insurgents seeking to oust President The rebels labeled their actions in Midan as a \\"tactical retreat,\\" the latest in a series of such pullbacks in the face of superior firepower. Opposition activists reported that more than 100 people across the nation were killed in violence Friday. A day earlier, believed to the bloodiest day of the rebellion, almost 300 died, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based activist group. Each side in the Syrian conflict has accused the other of inflating casualty counts for political reasons. The government has severely restricted the access of foreign journalists, making it difficult to verify the claims. Also on Friday, the United Nations Security Council agreed to extend for 30 days the U.N. observer mission in Syria. The period could be extended if the U.N. certifies that the violence has abated and that heavy weapons are no longer being used against population centers. The mission, with 300 observers and 90 civilian personnel, has largely been suspended since last month because of concern for the safety of its personnel. Even before the suspension, the observers had been unable to do much more than confirm massacres and document the bloody aftermath of battles they were helpless to prevent. Meanwhile, official media said Friday that Gen. Hisham Ikhtiyar, chief of national security, became the fourth high-ranking official to die of wounds suffered in the bombing Wednesday of a national security compound in Damascus. Gen. Asef Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president, was killed in the blast. Interior Minister Maj. Mohammed Ibrahim Shaar was injured, the government said, but his condition has not been publicly disclosed. Taking responsibility for the bombing were two groups fighting under the umbrella of the rebel , a collection of militias including military defectors and others fighters seeking to oust Assad. The bombing rattled the core of Assad's security establishment and seemed to shift momentum in the more than 16-month conflict to the side of the insurgents, who are armed mostly with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and homemade bombs. Although the rebels have made many gains and have seized huge swaths of territory, the government's superior arms usually have been sufficient to push insurgents back during aggressive counterattacks. That was apparently the case Friday in Damascus' Midan district, close to the walls of the Old City and long a center of opposition to Assad. In Midan, the opposition reportedly declared a \\"tactical retreat,\\" a move employed over and over again in a war where territory has frequently been won by the rebels and then relinquished in the face of superior government firepower.","completion":"The fighting in Damascus, the capital city of Syria, has been happening for six days in a row now.

Many people have left their homes to escape the fighting, and went to nearby countries like Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. The United Nations, a big organization that tries to help countries work together, has sent people to watch and report what is happening, but they can't always stop bad things from happening.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

There is a new prehistoric giant in town, set to be unveiled this week at the American Museum of Natural History. The creature, known as the Titanosaur, goes on public view Friday. The biggest dinosaur ever exhibited at the museum and among the largest ever discovered, it stretches 122 feet long and will rise nearly 20 feet to reach the ceiling. It is believed to have weighed, when walking the Earth... ||||| Researcher Pablo Puerta next to the titanosaur's femur. Image: José María Farfaglia and Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio Paleontologists based out of Argentina's Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio have discovered what is quite possibly the largest known animal ever to walk the Earth. The new species of titanosaur, as yet unnamed, is estimated to have weighed 77 tons and measured 120 feet long, making it as tall as a seven-story building. You know you're dealing with a true giant when it makes other sauropods look small in comparison. Even more exciting is the sheer number of specimens recovered from the dinosaurs' final resting place on the La Flecha farm in Patagonia. Over 200 fossils have been found on the farm, representing at least seven individuals from this record-breaking species. On top of that, only 20 percent of the quarry where the fossils were found has been excavated, and researchers expect to find many more specimens in the coming years. “What they discovered is a cemetery of dinosaurs the likes of which we had never seen in the history of Argentine paleontology,\\" said Ruben Cuneo, director of the Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio, to US News. “Given the length and magnitude this animal will bring along when it's reconstructed, there won't be a building that can contain it. I think we're going to need a new home.” The dig team, led by paleontologists Diego Pol and Jose Luis Carballido, concluded that the titanosaur remains were probably not transported into the quarry by rivers or other natural forces. Instead, the sauropods may have selected an isolated Late Cretaceous flood plain for their last moments, in the same way that dying elephants occasionally seek out comforting grave sites. There's also evidence that later on, the sauropods were pulled apart by marauding theropod dinosaurs. Over 50 teeth from the massive carnivore Tyrannotitan chubutensis were also discovered at the site, suggesting that some lucky scavengers had the feast of a lifetime 95-100 million years ago. If new species has edged Argentinosaurus as the previous record holder for world's largest land animal, but both may have been dwarfed by the mysterious Amphicoelias fragillimus. Based on descriptions of a single fossil, Amphicoelias could have weighed 135 tons, almost twice as much as this freshly discovered sauropod. The estimated size of Amphicoelias in red. Image via Matt Martyniuk. But the story behind this animal is somewhat suspect. An Amphicoelias vertebrate and femur were discovered in 1877 at the height of the Bone Wars, but the specimens were somehow lost in the subsequent decades. All modern paleontologists have to go on are the notes of the legendary fossil hunter Edward Drinker Cope. Studying an animal secondhand is obviously not ideal, and Amphicoelias is usually excluded from the list of biggest dinosaurs based on lack of evidence. Along those lines, some paleontologists think the new titanosaur needs to be subjected to more scrutiny before it is proclaimed the biggest land animal ever. \\"Whether or not the new animal really will be the largest sauropod we know remains to be seen,\\" said Paul Upchurch, a paleontologist at the University College of London, to ABC News. \\"Certainly the new animal appears to be at least as large as Argentinosaurus, and is a new species,\\" he said. \\"Its real scientific value comes from the fact that it looks like this new form will be more complete than Argentinosaurus, so we'll get a better look at the anatomy of one of these super-giants.\\" And as Brian Switek explained, \\"Even sauropods known from a decent amount of material are still too incompletely known to get a direct idea of how long and heavy they were.\\" So while dinophiles around the world are right to celebrate this momentous find, it's important to always say “for now” with record-breaking dinosaurs. The new titanosaur may be the top dog in 2014, but no doubt there are plenty of mind-boggling species that have yet to be unearthed. ||||| This is part of a special series about great rivalries: between tech titans, sports franchises, and even dinosaur hunters. Read about the series here. Daniel Engber Daniel Engber is a columnist for Slate. Illustration by Robert Neubecker Before his unexpected death in June, James Gandolfini had signed on to star in another HBO project: Instead of playing the shrewd and short-tempered capo of a criminal organization based in New Jersey, he was to be the shrewd and short-tempered capo of a criminal organization based in New Haven, Conn. Instead of a Mafioso, he’d be a paleontologist. The movie was to be called Bone Wars, about the feud between two fossil-hunting academics in the 19th century: Yale’s Othniel Charles Marsh (Gandolfini) and Edward Drinker Cope (Steve Carell), eventually of the University of Pennsylvania. Their many years of vicious competition—played out across the Wild West, with secret deals and sticks of dynamite—left both men destitute and disappointed. They also produced the most amazing dinosaur discoveries the world had ever known: Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Apatosaurus, and scores of other species. The ugly-tragic tale of Marsh and Cope has been recounted many times before, in documentaries, graphic novels, and lots and lots of books. As of 2005, you could even recreate the fracas on your coffee table with a deck of cards. (“Too much history, not enough fun,” one customer complained.) Its mass appeal relies in part upon the contrast of the characters: Marsh, cast in the role of the bald and bearded farmer’s son, a meticulous collector, a Darwinist; versus Cope, the gentleman scholar, a loosey-goosey science prodigy who did not believe in natural selection. The only things they had in common were their brilliance and ambition—qualities that set them on the path of mutually assured destruction. But the standard telling underplays a more fundamental rivalry: not that between Marsh and Cope, but one that set them both against a mild-mannered, older gent named Joseph Leidy. Advertisement Leidy’s work preceded that of his much more famous rivals. As the first paleontologist of vertebrates in the U.S., Leidy found evidence that horses, lions, rhinos, and other large mammals once roamed the country’s West. In 1856—a dozen years before the bone wars began—the ungainly professor made a more surprising discovery: America had dinosaurs. A few years later, Leidy published a description of the most complete dinosaur skeleton yet found, sent to him in Philadelphia by an amateur collector at the marl pits near Haddonfield, N.J. His work concluded that the Hadrosaurus foulkii was bipedal, a gigantic animal that reared back on its hind legs and tail. By the late 1860s, young Cope had become, like Leidy, a member of Philadelphia’s Academy of Natural Sciences and started fossil-hunting in the Garden State. That’s where Cope and Marsh began their lifelong grudge. The two had met briefly in Germany, but the bone wars started with a visit that Marsh, already a Yale professor, made to Haddonfield in 1868. On his way out of town, Marsh bribed workers at the pits to send what bones they found directly to New Haven, bypassing Cope. This subterfuge inspired further rounds of sneakiness from Cope and Marsh, and some from Leidy, too. In the early 1870s, all three men set out to look for dinosaurs out West, where the dry, mountainous terrain made fossils numerous and relatively easy to unearth. Marsh felt he had a prior claim to the sites near Fort Bridger in Wyoming, and he hired spies to monitor Cope’s travels in the area. (In communiqués with his employees, Marsh called Cope by a code name, “Jones.”) Marsh also tried to waylay fossils from the local diggers who had been sending finds to Leidy. And Leidy, for his part, encouraged them to hide the bones from Cope. This three-way row played out in the scientific literature as well. In the spring of 1870, Leidy pointed out in public that Cope’s reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus had the skull attached to the wrong end, as if to make a creature with a long tail and a short neck, rather than one with a long neck and a short tail. Marsh later said he’d been the one to notice this mistake. “When I informed Professor Cope of it his wounded vanity received a shock from which it has never recovered, and he has since been my bitter enemy,” Marsh later wrote. “I give this transaction as one sample of Professor Cope and his methods—one taste of the cheese.” Advertisement In Wyoming, the fossil hunters each found evidence of a strange, elephantine beast with six knobby protrusions on its head. Leidy named it before the others—Uintatherium robustum—but the battle over primacy continued in the journals. Cope and Marsh came up with reasons to rename Leidy’s species several dozen times, as if they were making new discoveries on the basis of their own fossil finds. They fought ferociously as Leidy’s contributions were pushed off to the side. “[Marsh] repeats his statements,” Cope wrote in the American Naturalist in June 1873, “as though the Uintatherium were a Rosinante, and the ninth commandment a wind-mill.” When Cope added that some of his mistakes were the results of printers’ errors, Marsh replied, “As a sleight-of-hand performance with names and dates, [Cope’s explanation] shows practice, and is amusing, but to those familiar with the subject, and to moralists, it suggests sad reflections.” “Poor Old Leidy” (as Cope called him) was far less confrontational than his younger peers and smaller in his speculations. Cope in particular would vividly describe his wild visions of the ancient world. “At night-fall, we may imagine them trooping to the shore and suspending themselves to the cliffs by the claw-bearing fingers of their wing-limbs,” he wrote in 1872, inspired by some pterodactyl bones. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Creative Commons. By 1874, Leidy had decided to quit the field of paleontology altogether. He could not abide the endless sniping, nor did he have the money to compete. While Cope, the eldest son of a Quaker shipping magnate, and Marsh are often contrasted as gentleman and grind, in truth both were very wealthy. Marsh was born into a modest home, but his fantastically wealthy Uncle George sent him first to Andover and then to Yale. When Marsh joined the faculty in New Haven in 1866, it was in part because the family had donated 150,000 for the establishment of a natural history museum. Leidy had no such advantages. His father was a hatter, and Leidy spent his early years in research working extra hours for the city coroner. While Cope and Marsh could afford to hire men for outrageous expeditions, not to mention spies and double agents, Leidy didn’t have the budget or the will. The bone wars moved on without him. By 1878, Cope and Marsh were bickering over bigger, more impressive claims in Colorado and Wyoming. Each paid his teams of diggers to work through the winter to help uncover evidence of fabulous dinosaurs from the Jurassic period: Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and many others. The professors’ employees fought one another, sometimes throwing rocks and dirt or brandishing revolvers in the field. Some switched sides and others used a slash-and-burn approach to excavation, destroying bones so as to flummox late-arriving peers. Their dispute made its way to Washington, D.C., where Marsh figured out a way to cut off Cope’s funding and tried to get the government to repossess his rival’s fossils. In 1890, Cope went after Marsh in the pages of the New York Herald. “Scientists Wage Bitter Warfare,” the headline read. “Red Hot Denials Put Forth: Heavy Blows Dealt in Attack and Defense and Lots of Hard Nuts Provided for Scientific Digestion.” Eventually, both men would lose both their funding and their credibility, and their careers would be forever linked by their quarrel. What became of Leidy? If it hadn’t been for Marsh and Cope, and the way they bullied him aside, he might have continued on in paleontology and been far better known. “By all contemporary judgment, Leidy was one of the most outstanding American biologists of his century,” writes his biographer Leonard Warren in Joseph Leidy: The Last Man Who Knew Everything. “Yet he is relatively unknown today, even among people in that field.” When his younger rivals turned fossil-hunting from a scholar’s art into a contact sport, Leidy quit the team. Warren cites the preface to one of Leidy’s most important works on fossilized remains. It begins with a bit of modesty that doubles as an indictment of his more aggressive colleagues: “No attempt has been made at generalizations or theories which might attract the momentary attention and admiration of the scientific community,” he wrote. “We have endeavored to see and represent things correctly, nothing more.” By retreating from the battle in the West, Leidy erased himself from history and found a legacy of lasting inattention. The bone wars did have a happy ending of a sort, because they nudged Leidy back to important work in other fields. After abandoning paleontology, he returned to other areas in which he’d long been interested. Before his work on the ancient fauna of North America, Leidy had been the country’s leading parasitologist. While Cope and Marsh went off searching for bigger, better bones, Leidy roamed the fish markets in Philadelphia, scouring the seafood entrails for novel parasites. Among his microscopic discoveries were the microorganism in pork that causes trichinosis and the source of canine heartworm. Leidy also worked in anatomy and pathology, and he used his skill with microscopes to help police distinguish human blood from chicken remains. He studied gems and minerals, too, and left his sizable collection to the Smithsonian. ||||| This week, the American Museum of Natural History in New York will unveil its newest exhibit to the press: the skeleton of a huge plant-eating sauropod that many paleontologists think is the largest dinosaur ever discovered. The animal is new enough that it doesn’t yet have a proper scientific name — it’s being called Titanosaur for now. It is 122 feet long and 19 feet high at the midpoint of its back, a specimen so big that its head will peek out of the great hall of the Wallach Orientation Center and into the elevator bank on the fourth floor. Its dorsal vertebrae will brush the lofty ceiling. But in the museum’s files is buried a description of a vertebra for a dinosaur that would have been 55 percent longer than the Titanosaur — and bigger than any animal ever known. The only problem: The vertebra described has been missing for more than 100 years, and many people think that it may never have existed at all, or at least not as it was described in the first place. The missing dinosaur is known as Amphicoelias fragillimus, and the only recorded evidence of its existence — a piece of vertebra measuring almost 5 feet tall — is said to have been dug up just outside of Cañon City, a small town in central Colorado that for a few short years in the late 1800s was the dinosaur capital of the world. Along with dozens of bones from other dinosaurs, the partial vertebra is listed on the manifest of a freight train that went to Philadelphia, where it was first described and sketched in a paper by famed paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Around the time of Cope’s death in 1897, the Amphicoelias bone is said to have been sent with the rest of his massive collection to the American Museum of Natural History, where it was received and catalogued as FR 5777: “Amphicoelias fragillimus, Holotype.” But when museum President Henry Osborn and his colleague Charles Mook finally got around to analyzing the collection more than two decades later, there was no Amphicoelias bone to catalog. In their exhaustive review of the sauropods of the Cope collection in January 1921, Osborn and Mook write, “The type of this species has not been found in the Cope Collection, and its characters cannot be clearly determined.” It makes sense to be skeptical that an animal almost twice the length of a blue whale once roamed the American West. A few months ago, I went searching for the truth about that missing bone. I was not the first — plenty of others have sought the largest dinosaur that has ever lived. What I found was a quest that has driven some people toward maniacal competition, some to conspiracy theories and others to disregard scientific consensus. It drove me to a little rocky outcropping on a hill in rural Colorado known as Cope’s Nipple. My search started in Cañon City with Dan Grenard, a former Bureau of Land Management official turned amateur historian and paleontology enthusiast. Grenard is the kind of small-town resident who leads restoration projects, volunteers to share his knowledge with local middle-schoolers and knows pretty much everyone in the area. When Grenard, a few others and I hiked into the hills behind Cañon City, we found the spot where Amphicoelias was likely uncovered. It was completely unremarkable. There was an ever-so-slight depression in the ground, and there were more light-colored rocks strewn about than in the surrounding areas. Melissa Smeins, who took over from Grenard as the Bureau of Land Management’s resident geologist, casually picked one up and handed it to me. “Dinosaur bone chip.” Wait, what? One hundred and thirty-eight years earlier, a seminarian-turned-teacher named Oramel Lucas had stood in the same spot — and also found bones. Lucas ran the one-room schoolhouse in the valley next to Fourmile Creek, which was a few miles north of Cañon City in an area now known as Garden Park. Lucas knew of other dinosaur digs going on in the area, but, as biologist Randy Moore writes in his book “Dinosaurs by the Decades,” Lucas may not have gone looking for them, instead simply stumbling across giant fossilized bones on a walk in the nearby hills. Whatever the provenance, he contacted one of his science professors at his alma mater, Oberlin College, who connected him to Cope. Lucas, it turned out, had wandered across a veritable Camarasaurus graveyard; over the next few years he’d pull six of these sauropods out of the 150-million-year-old green-and-red dirt layer in the hills known to geologists as the Morrison Formation. Lucas’s biggest find, though, was yet to come. In 1878, Cope published a two-paragraph paper in The American Naturalist about it: “I have recently received from my indefatigable friend, Mr. O. W. Lucas, the almost entire neural arch of the vertebra of the largest saurian I have yet seen,” he wrote. By that time Cañon City had changed. It had been a Western outpost where most townspeople worked as miners or shopkeepers and stagecoaches regularly rolled through the downtown strip bringing goods to the train station. In the 1870s, though, the cargo being transported shifted from ores to dinosaur bones as the town became ground zero for the growing rivalry between the two most famous men in paleontology: Cope and his rival, Othniel Charles Marsh. This rivalry — now known as the Bone Wars — involved humiliation, bribery and eventually financial ruin for both sides. It also led to one of the most incredible periods of paleontological discovery in history, as the men’s rivalry led them to finance expeditions to the fossil bone beds of the West. Eventually, their teams identified more than 100 new dinosaur species, though many of those species have since been lumped together or otherwise revised. Amphicoelias fragillimus was one of the species discovered. Marsh and Cope started out as friendly rivals, even naming new species after each other. Marsh was more academic and better funded — his millionaire uncle George Peabody built a museum at Yale for him — while Cope was more independent — he kept many of his favorite bones hanging in his Philadelphia house — and more prolific, cranking out more than a thousand academic papers. Cope eventually bought The American Naturalist to directly publish the notes on his finds. In Cope’s version of the story, their relationship soured when Marsh secretly bought bones from the workers at one of Cope’s quarries. In Marsh’s, the fallout happened after he publicly embarrassed Cope by pointing out that Cope’s Elasmosaurus reconstruction had its head literally coming out of its ass. Either way, the men went from sniping at each other to actively working against each other. At sites across the West, their workers were directed to sabotage one another, destroying rival camps, quarries and even bones. Lucas’s findings didn’t go unnoticed by Marsh. As Lucas was shipping his first major haul out of the city, Marsh sent a Kansas professor named Benjamin Mudge to the area to persuade him to switch bosses. But Lucas was loyal to Cope, and thus the extremely large vertebra he found sticking out of the depression I was standing in was packed up and sent to Philadelphia. One hundred and thirty-eight years later, I looked down at the rock Smeins had placed in my hand and saw that, yes — it was a dinosaur bone. There were little striations throughout the fossil, the telltale signs of carbon petrification. I looked around on the ground and there were little bits of dinosaur bone everywhere. Was I literally holding a piece of Amphicoelias in my hand? Who knows. As writer Brian Switek has explained, every paleo researcher is familiar with the feeling of finding a busted fossil. Where a beautiful bone once was, only unidentifiable fragments remain. Behold: the Chunkasaurus. Grenard explained that the Amphicoelias probably existed a couple of million years after the other dinosaurs that were found there. That means that erosion exposed it first, and that many of the bones had likely shattered well before people could find them. Cope noted the thinning condition of the vertebra himself, calling the species fragillimus and noting that “much care was requisite to secure its preservation.” Ken Carpenter, a short, stocky professor at Utah State University Eastern, spent 20 years trying to preserve something different: Cope’s discovery of Amphicoelias. In 2006, Carpenter tried to settle debate over the dinosaur by synthesizing his research in a paper titled “The Biggest of the Big.” It drew academic focus back to the dinosaur decades after it had been relegated to the sidelines. For nearly two decades, Carpenter worked at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, leading a team in charge of finding fossils. In 1992, while surveying the Garden Park area with his research assistant, he stumbled upon a huge find in a riverbank — a nearly intact Stegosaurus skeleton, one of the few that has been found. The Stegosaurus made Carpenter a star in the paleontology world, but he was interested in an even more elusive quarry: Amphicoelias. He acknowledges that it’s most likely that the vertebra and any other Amphi bones have turned into Chunkasaurus, but he still spent years researching the animal and even more time combing the Colorado countryside looking for more Amphicoelias bones. When his traditional searches came up empty, he decided to bring in a ground-penetrating radar — generally used by excavation crews to make sure they don’t hit sewer lines — to see if he could find any bones still hiding under the surface. It was useless, since the fossils and rock matrix the bones are encased in turn out to have the same density. “It turns out it was nothing like ‘Jurassic Park,’” he says. Carpenter, now 66 and silver-haired, was a little grumpy when I prodded him by phone about the big dinosaur; he says he has moved on from his monomaniacal pursuit of Amphicoelias. He now spends his field time looking for prehistoric mammals in northwestern Utah and calls the argument over the largest dinosaur a paleontological “dick-measuring contest” that he’s not interested in participating in. When I told him I may have been holding a piece of Amphi bone in my hand, he was unimpressed. “A bone fragment’s a bone fragment’s a bone fragment,” he says. But once I got him talking about his research into Amphi and the incredible lengths he went to to try to find more, he perked up and started getting excited, even wistful. In his paper on Amphicoelias, Carpenter tried to synthesize everything known about the animal so far. He even reconstructed the missing bone out of plastic foam; after adding the missing parts, he had a vertebra that was more than 8.5 feet tall. Expanded along the dimensions of a Diplodocus skeleton, that results in an animal that’s 190 feet long. For comparison, blue whales can measure up to 100 feet long. “I’d like to model the entire skeleton,” he says. “But that’s still a pipe dream.” ANIMAL LENGTH Amphicoelias fragillimus 190ft Titanosaur 122 Blue whale 98 Brontosaurus excelsus 72 Giant squid 59 Tyrannosarus rex 39 Triceratops horridus 26 African elephant 23 Stegosaurus stenops 21 Sources: Ken Carpenter, American Natural History Museum, The Princeton field guide to dinosaurs, national geographic It makes sense to be skeptical that an animal almost twice the length of a blue whale — and more than 50 percent longer than any other known sauropod — once roamed the American West. For a long time, many in the paleontological world believed that it never existed at all, and that it was simply a fish tale Cope used to gain prestige in the ongoing battle with Marsh. But the fact that, as far as we know, Marsh never once took the opportunity to question the finding is instructive, as he would have loved to have more fodder to fight his rival. And although Osborn, director of the American Natural History Museum, bemoaned the missing bone in his survey of Cope’s collection, he was convinced it had existed. Modern skeptics are less likely to believe that Amphi was fake than to believe that something else fishy was going on. Cary Woodruff is one such skeptic. He’s an adjunct instructor of earth sciences at Montana State University who specializes in studying sauropod vertebrae, and he’s not convinced that any dinosaur can get get much larger than 100 feet long. Early last year, in a paper titled “The Fragile Legacy of Amphicoelias fragillimus,” he and his co-author John Foster argue that not only is the Amphi bone likely just part of a Diplodocus specimen, it wasn’t even that big. Based on the other measurements in Cope’s notes — and the fact that Cope was notoriously careless in his rush to get out papers — they argue that the most likely explanation is that a typo changed the height of the vertebra from 1050 mm to 1500 mm, which would make it about a foot and a half shorter. “People have been working in the Morrison for 130-plus years, continuously,” Woodruff told me. “We have never found a single scrap of any other bone that’s even close to the size of what Amphicoelias is reported to be.” Woodruff doesn’t think that Cope was trying to deceive anyone when he made his measurements, but that he realized soon after that his sizing was wrong. Woodruff’s theory? Cope wasn’t interested in being humiliated again as he was with Elasmosaurus, but he also didn’t want to perpetuate bad science. So he simply stopped talking about the great beast after his two-paragraph description in The American Naturalist. That would explain why Cope never mentioned Amphi in his later writings, even in his papers about evolution and larger body size that eventually became known as Cope’s Rule. Carpenter disagrees, calling Woodruff’s theory of a cover-up a “pretty harsh accusation for a kid standing on the shoulder of a giant.” And there’s another person who thinks the idea of a supersized sauropod may not be wrong out of hand: Nathan Myhrvold, the polymath CEO of Intellectual Ventures and former CTO of Microsoft. Myhrvold has recently turned his attention to dinosaur size. (In previous years, it’s been on cooking and nuclear power.) In a 2013 PLoS paper, he argues that most of our current size estimates of dinosaurs are wrong for two reasons: The first is that paleontologists aren’t great at using stats to approximate animal size from bone measurements. The second is that most of the individuals that scientists are using as prototypes for their species weren’t fully mature. “Unfortunately the specimens that have the most complete skeletons are not the very biggest ones,” Myhrvold told me over email. “I think that at some point we will find new specimens of enormous sauropod, and hopefully will have enough material to settle the matter. But even then, we may find scraps of something that might be even bigger.” In the meantime, a small stream of large-dinosaur sleuths continue to make the trek to New York to see if there are any Amphicoelias clues at the American Museum of Natural History. Mark Norell, the current head of paleontology there, tells me that the big bone room was cleaned and recategorized eight years ago, so it’s impossible that the 5-foot-tall bone is in there. But he’s willing to leave a slight opening that it’s somewhere: “If you have a collection like ours — we’ve got nearly a million specimens — it’s like running a library. Things just disappear. Sometimes they show up years later.” There’s a precedent for that. In 1998, a few amateur dinosaur hunters, including Jack McIntosh, a physics professor at Wesleyan who died last month, persuaded the museum to let them check out Cope’s files. Although Osborn and Mook had claimed there were no other records from the digs at Cañon City, McIntosh found several letters between Cope and Lucas, as well as Cope’s field notebook from a trip to Cañon City in 1879. In it was the first description of exactly where Amphi was found — Grenard and I used those notes to find the spot on Cope’s Nipple. But those notes didn’t help us find more Amphicoelias specimens. So, after a long day out dinosaur hunting, I headed back to my hotel in Cañon City, the Quality Inn & Suites, and walked over to an alcove in the lobby next to the stairs. There, in the corner, was Carpenter’s reproduction of the Amphicoelias vertebra, mounted just like the other biggest dinosaur in the world, Titanosaur, minus a few hundred bones here and there. The model was too big to fit in his office, and the Denver Museum didn’t want it. So, thanks to a favor from a friend of Grenard’s who runs the hotel, it resides in the alcove, confusing tipsy guests on their way out of the bar for a smoke. It’s not the American Museum of Natural History, but for now, it will have to do.

Recently, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and her husband, Prince Charles, graced a thanksgiving service with their presence, clad in their finest attire that captured the attention of both the attendees and the world at large. In this article, we will discuss the details surrounding their arrival and the ensembles worn by the royals during this momentous occasion. Arriving ahead of the thanksgiving service, Camilla and Prince Charles made their presence known early on, setting the tone for the event. As the couple stepped out of their vehicle, Prince Charles looked dapper in a well-tailored suit accompanied by a classic tie representing the elegant style characteristic of the British royalty. On the other hand, Camilla captivated the onlookers as she entered the venue, exuding radiance and poise in her choice of attire for the event. The Duchess of Cornwall opted for a pale eau de nil silk ensemble that perfectly captured the essence of sophistication and refinement. The hue, a delicate and soft shade of green-blue, created an almost ethereal aura around her, emphasizing the regal presence that she carries with utmost pride. The ensemble consisted of an eau de nil silk flowing dress, accentuated by a matching lightweight coat that draped effortlessly around her figure. Adding a touch of sparkle to the ensemble, Camilla donned a gorgeous pearl necklace that further enhanced her timeless beauty. However, the royal couple was not alone in their attendance; they were joined by other notable members of the royal family, including Prince Harry and the Cambridges. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, upheld the grandeur of the event in their respective ensembles. The Duke looked every bit the royal in his well-fitted suit, while Kate Middleton, known for her impeccable fashion choices, stole the show in a stunning, long-sleeved, mauve dress that accentuated her slender figure.

Boasting an A-list cast, an acclaimed director, and a screenplay inspired by a best-selling novel, the ingredients were all there for a cinematic masterpiece. Unfortunately, \\"The Disappointing Embarkment\\" is anything but. It's an underwhelming and often tedious journey that squanders the potential offered by its premise, leaving viewers with a toothache-inducing combination of plot holes and worn-out clichés. To begin with, the film's pacing is an anchor—weighing on the story and handcuffing the once sought-after cast. The pacing is so painfully slow that even an accomplished editor couldn't save it. Each scene seems to drag on, leaving no surprise when the two-hour runtime feels more like an eternity. This issue could potentially be forgiven if it were in service of doing justice to the source material. However, the film manages to miss the mark there as well, straying so far off course from the beloved book that it's barely recognizable. The talented ensemble cast is utterly wasted, given little to do other than reciting their wooden lines and going through the motions. Their palpable lack of chemistry is disheartening, turning what should be mesmerizing performances into disingenuous caricatures. Perhaps the biggest travesty is the lead actor, who fails to deliver any depth, managing only to bore us with their one-dimensional portrayal. The script, too, leaves much to be desired, with plot holes big enough to sail a ship through. Instead of exploring the profound themes brought forth in the novel, the movie opts for contrived and shallow melodrama. Predictable twists and turns abound, providing nothing in the way of intelligent storytelling or fresh insights into human nature. The dialogue is cringeworthy at best and completely incomprehensible at worst, fading the film's efforts into a sea of mediocrity. As for the film's cinematography, it serves as a textbook example of style over substance, with sweeping shots and picturesque backdrops that simply can't mask the underlying weaknesses of the storyline. While visually appealing, these elements further underscore the absence of a unifying vision and contribute to a disjointed, confusing experience. Finally, the score of \\"The Disappointing Embarkment\\" is just as uninspired as the rest of the production. Repeatedly playing the same theme to the point of annoyance, it manages to become yet another distraction, cementing the unfortunate disappointment the film has become. In conclusion, \\"The Disappointing Embarkment\\" had all the components necessary for an unforgettable, transcendental experience: a compelling premise, an award-winning cast, and an accomplished director. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver on every front, leaving the audience stranded in a sea of clichés, unfulfilled potential, and general ennui.

I literally laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools.

The African American community should take umbrage at their very being. Who was this classless fat slob who portrayed Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison.

Given the question: I am testing my students' logic. What is the answer they should choose between \\"dry\\" and \\"wet\\"? Logic test: A truck was doing several test runs on a race track fitted with a sprinkler system on one end of the track to wet the asphalt.

The answer is:","completion":"The answer is (A) dry part of the track. To understand why, let's dive deeper into the logic and the physics behind it. Friction plays a significant role in maintaining grip and control during any vehicle's movement on a surface. The friction between the vehicle's tires and the surface depends on two factors: the nature of the surface and the condition of the tires. In this logic test, we have two variables to consider; the temperature of the tires and the condition of the track (dry or wet). Let's analyze the effect these variables have on the friction between the truck's tires and the track. 1. Temperature of the tires: Warmer tires generally provide better grip because the rubber compound becomes softer and more adhesive at higher temperatures. This increased adhesion allows the tires to stick better to the surface, providing more friction and therefore better grip and control. 2. Condition of the track (dry or wet): A dry track naturally provides more friction than a wet track. When the surface is dry, there is direct contact between the rubber tires and the asphalt, allowing for a higher level of friction. On a wet track, however, water is present between the tires and the track's surface, which reduces friction and makes it harder for the vehicle to maintain grip. In this specific logic test, the truck's tires were much warmer before getting to the wet part of the track. This means that the tires had better grip, and higher friction was present on the dry part of the track, given the increased adhesion due to the warm tires and the direct contact between the rubber tires and the dry asphalt. When the truck reached the wet part of the track, the water on the surface diminished the friction, making it lower than on the dry part of the track.

Article: Five little blue guys and a token female Smurfette, sucked through a wormhole, hide out from a sorcerer at marketing executive Neil Patrick Harris’ Manhattan pad in this relentlessly witless and cynical children’s movie packed with potty jokes, product plugs and double-entendres along the lines of “What the Smurf?” What the Smurf, indeed. Ineptly directed by Raja Gosnell — the genius behind the “Scooby-Doo” features, “Big Momma’s House,” and “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” — this cheesy-looking flick has lousy animation, worse special effects and the most headache-inducing, blurry 3-D since “Clash of the Titans.” The animated ’80s Hanna-Barbera TV show was based on a comic-book character that originated in 1958 in Belgium, and may have been that country’s most dubious import since waffles. But the show was a masterpiece compared to this drecky, borderline-sexist mix of animation and live action concocted by a team of writers whose credits include “Daddy Day Camp,” “Norbit” and “Zookeeper.” Hank Azaria does some major scenery chewing as the wizard — relieving himself in a restaurant in front of Tim Gunn, who really shouldn’t give up his day job — who with his CGI cat has a surprisingly violent climactic confrontation with the Smurfs in Central Park. Jonathan Winters voices the Smurfs’ Stalin-like leader, with Katy Perry as Smurfette, his sole female offspring (out of 99). Is there some unwritten law that George Lopez has to do voice work in every children’s movie? It’s not as if he’s good at it. Aside from a Marilyn Monroe homage, the movie doesn’t really do much with its Smurfs-out-of-water premise; “The Muppets Take Manhattan” it ain’t. There are long sequences devoted to promoting FAO Schwarz and “Guitar Hero” (the blue guys sing and dance along to Aerosmith), though. The beloved Mr. Harris, who has only been seen in bad features (“Beastly,” “The Best and the Brightest”) this year, maintains his streak with a character who works in the same Rockefeller Center office building as Justin Timberlake in last week’s “Friends With Benefits.” I doubt this movie’s target audience will care much about Harris’ ambivalence about his wide-eyed wife’s (Jayma Mays) pregnancy or his problems with his bitchy boss (Sofia Vergara). It may be going a little far to suggest that taking your little one to “The Smurfs” — this season’s pre-K equivalent of “Transformers: Dark of the Moon” — borders on child abuse. But be warned that if you do, in the film’s words, you’ll be “up Smurf creek without a Smurfing paddle.” ||||| ‘The Smurfs’’ continues the improbable journey of a tribe of little blue gremlins from the pen of a Belgian comic-book artist in 1958 to the multi-tentacled entertainment franchise of today. Would Peyo (real name Pierre Culliford) recognize the charmingly simple critters he originally dubbed “Schtroumpfs’’ in this noisy, formulaic family film? The best thing about “The Smurfs’’ is that the answer is probably yes. In most respects, the movie’s pure Saturday-afternoon kiddie product, as close as you can come to popular CGI/live-action crud like “Alvin and the Chipmunks’’ and “Beverly Hills Chihuahua’’ without the lawyers getting involved. Early on, six of the major Smurfs from Smurf Village are whisked through a magic portal to Manhattan, where they befriend human costars and scramble past the usual tourist landmarks on their way back home. There is creepy animal CGI. There is needless 3-D. There are random movie quotes. (Grouchy Smurf, crossing the street: “I’m walkin’ here!’’ and, really now, the Venn diagram overlap between audiences for both this movie and “Midnight Cowboy’’ has to be minimal. In fact, I think I’m it.) The voice of Grouchy is provided by George Lopez, who truly has to be stopped. In all, the worst parts of “The Smurfs’’ can probably be summed up in two words: Smurf rap. Then there are the good parts, or the less painful parts for parents and other stray adults who find themselves in attendance. The human couple befriended by the Smurfs are played by Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays, the latter leaving her nervous energy back on the “Glee’’ set and appearing refreshingly relaxed. Harris manages to class up whatever he touches, even if the sight of him repeatedly hitting himself with an umbrella probably won’t go on the career highlight reel. As the villainous wizard Gargamel, Hank Azaria gets to put on a baldy wig and fake buck-teeth and overact as broadly as he can. A little of this goes a long way unless you’re 6 years old, which is the point. Sofia Vergara, of TV’s “Modern Family,’’ also shows up as Harris’s meaniepants boss, but she shares the screenplay’s confusion as to what, exactly, she’s doing here. “The Smurfs’’ wears its cross-promotional crassness on its sleeve. A scene set in FAO Schwarz makes room for product placement of all kinds, with Mars’s M&M candies emerging as the most shameless offender. And I hate to be PC, but does Smurfette - the lone female Smurf in the movie - have to be a shopaholic twit? If they can give her the voice of Katy Perry, can’t they give her some of Perry’s girl-power oomph? Heck, send her to Columbia Business School and let her take over the long-range financial planning of Smurf Village. The other characters will be familiar to fans of the comic and the iconic 1980s Saturday morning cartoon. Clumsy Smurf (voiced by Anton Yelchin) is the adorably klutzy hero, backed up by Grouchy, Smurfette, Brainy (Fred Armisen), and the doughty, kilt-wearing Gutsy (Alan Cumming). Leading them all is Papa Smurf, whose gentle wisdom remains the most appealing aspect of “The Smurfs’’ for kids and grown-ups alike.

No, wait. That sounds too positive. How about, \\"I wouldn't smurf Gosnell's 'The Smurfs' on my smurfiest enemy.\\" There, that's better. Gosnell, who plundered our Saturday morning memories for back-to-back, live-action \\"Scooby-Doo\\" adventures, relies on cutting-edge CGI and unnecessary 3-D wizardry to transport the pint-size heroes of our childhood from their native enchanted forest to noisy New York City. Once here, the Smurfs interact with incredulous humans, impart a little homespun wisdom and help make our grungy existence a tad more animated. Which means \\"The Smurfs\\" is exactly like Amy Adams's princess-in-Manhattan comedy \\"Enchanted,\\" only far less clever, kindhearted, original, exciting or entertaining. For the benefit of our readers who didn't grow up in the 1980s, the Smurfs are the unusual creation of the Belgian cartoonist Peyo, and their weekly adventures fueled an animated series on NBC from 1981 from 1989. The blue-skinned creatures stand \\"three apples high,\\" wear white pants and a matching cap, dine primarily on sarsaparilla leaves and smurfberries, and reside in mushroom-shaped houses nestled deep in the woods. Because all Smurfs look the same, they're differentiated by adjectives which best describe their personalities, be it Brainy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf or Passive-Aggressive Smurf (I kid you not). This movie also deserves such a moniker. I nominate Obnoxious Smurf, Dopey Smurf, Idiotic Smurf or some other Smurf not to be named here, given the film's fondness for revolting toilet jokes. To be fair, I liked \\"The Smurfs\\" back when the blue gnomes dominated weekend television. Granted, I was 7 years old at the time, which helps explain the attraction. [Full disclosure: The 7-year-old in our family, who has never seen a \\"Smurfs\\" cartoon in his life, thoroughly enjoyed Gosnell's feature and currently plans to dress as a Smurf for Halloween. Good thing he's not the critic here.] And so parents, be warned: Unlike family films produced by Pixar, \\"The Smurfs\\" will only appeal to a pre-adolescent audience. Four credited screenwriters tasked with reintroducing \\"The Smurfs\\" to a new generation hatch a paper-thin plot that finds six Smurfs - led by Papa (Jonathan Winters) and Smurfette (pop singer Katy Perry) - sucked through a magical vortex and dropped into Central Park. Hot on the Smurfs' blue trail is evil sorcerer Gargamel (Hank Azaria) and his feisty cat, Azrael, who somehow manage to pursue our adventurers to the Big Apple. Luckily, the Smurfs take shelter with gentle Grace (\\"Glee\\" star Jayma Mays) and her workaholic husband, Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris), who both need to be reminded that life moves pretty fast, and if you don't stop to smurf the roses every now and again, you just might miss the special moments. Not that Gosnell's \\"Smurfs\\" has any special moments to share. Outside of a soaring opening sequence that follows the Smurfs as they ride on the backs of birds, the 3-D is as unmemorable as the instantly forgettable storyline. The Smurfs may be expertly rendered using top-of-the-line digital technology, but outside of a scene where greedy shoppers at Manhattan's famed F.A.O. Schwartz try to buy Clumsy Smurf because they mistake him for the latest must-have toy, not a lot is done to bring these magical visitors into our decidedly non-magical world. At least when the Muppets took Manhattan in 1984, we were treated to such ingenious celebrity cameos as Art Carney, Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields and former New York mayor Ed Koch. \\"The Smurfs\\" has Azaria relieving himself in the middle of a restaurant and a digitally enhanced Azrael licking his privates. Now who wants to pay a few extra bucks to see that in 3-D? ||||| Laremy Legel July 29, 2011 It was the best of times, it was the Smurft of times. There, with that out of the way we can safely avoid all future punning. What will be impossible for you to avoid, should you take on this mission, is about 100 minutes of physical comedy. Pratfalls and kicked CGI cats, Smurfs being tossed to and fro. Still, this is to be expected, and for the young humans amongst us these moments should prove relatively hilarious. For the adults in the room? I remained unmoved. Before we break down the plot of The Smurfs, let’s pause for a moment to reflect on the 3-D aspect of the film. It’s pointless, completely superfluous, devoid of any value to the consumer. It’s as if we’ve been asked to pay a toll for a road that we don’t want to drive on. Why do I need equipment to watch a film? I’m there to be entertained, or enlightened, and wearing glasses for average 3-D does neither. Ugh, enough already. /Rant As for the plot of The Smurfs, it’s relatively straightforward. Gargamel, the evil wizard in Smurf-land, attacks the Smurfs on their own territory. Through the magic of product placement they are transported to New York City. Gargamel (played by Hank Azaria in massive levels of makeup) follows them, along with his excellently evil cat, so it’s fortunate the Smurfs are taken in by Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays. Smurfette, Papa Smurf, Grumpy, Clumsy, and Gutsy are the five smurfs on the run, and they use “smurf” for every third word or so. The gang needs to escape back to their enchanted village, while Gargamel wants to extract their magical blue essence for use in his spells. Clearly, we’re not dealing with anything too complicated here. Still, to its eternal credit, The Smurfs at least realizes how logically out of place it is for this generation. The “smurf for every sentence” topic is discussed, and Smurfette’s disparate gender is considered. Tim Gunn makes an appearance, as does Madison McKinley, she of “I wore fangs on The Bachelor” fame (which, for the record, was amazing). The fact that The Smurfs basically admits to the adults, “We know, we know” leaves one less bitter. They aren’t peddling Pixar, but they aren’t pushing Poppers either. A basset hound makes a prominent appearance. We can build on this. What doesn’t really fly is the cat vomit scene. And the occasional potty humor. Product placement and 3-D have already been mentioned, but they’ll feel overtly annoying should you enter the theater with your child. But for all the film has going against it, it never reaches the true depths of despair. They made about 100 Smurf jokes, but they left another 100 on the table. The CGI cat was fun, and likely saved them from a Humane Society lawsuit. Hank Azaria deserves a paycheck after his years of service. Finally, Neil Patrick Harris is impossible to work up a good hate for, he’s the perfect Smurf liaison to the real world. Once the solid factors are considered The Smurfs ends up being just below average, it won’t give you nightmares, and small ones might dig it. Smurfs up.* Grade: C- *Sorry, that’s terrible. Categories: Reviews Tags: Madison McKinley |||||Summary:","completion":"\\"The Smurfs,\\" directed by Raja Gosnell, has received heavily critical reviews for its use of clichéd plot, subpar 3D effects, overuse of product placements, and crude humour. The film sees popular characters from the '80s TV show being sucked into a wormhole, ending up in Manhattan, where they dodge the pursuit of an evil wizard while hiding in Neil Patrick Harris’ apartment. The film further evoked displeasure for its borderline sexist portrayal of the sole female character, Smurfette - voiced by Katy Perry. Although attempting to engage the young audience with the iconic blue characters, the film abides strictly to a formula that has been equated to child-level movie creations like “Alvin and the Chipmunks” and “Beverly Hills Chihuahua.” It has been criticized heavily for its overuse of physical comedy, unnecessary 3D effects, and disappointing script. Despite these negatives, some critics noted the film's self-awareness of its outlandish setting and plot, which provided some moments of slight humour. Overall, \\"The Smurfs\\" has been received poorly, even as it attempts to appeal to an entirely new generation of viewers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a summary based on this article: The Public Theater has confirmed that Edward Snowden will guest star in every performance of Privacy via a pre-recorded video. The co-production with Donmar Warehouse is inspired by a post-Snowden view on privacy and technology, and encourages the use of cell phones during the show. Snowden made international headlines in 2013 when he copied and leaked classified National Security Agency documents. His actions shed light on issues of government secrecy and surveillance and fueled worldwide debates on the matter of informational privacy. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Privacy will begin performances July 2 and officially open July 18. The boundary-pushing work is co-created by James Graham and Josie Rourke, and is set to play through August 14 in the Public's Newman Theater. Daniel Radcliffe Says Audience Can Email Him During Privacy Radcliffe stars as “The Writer” and is joined by fellow cast members De’Adre Aziza, Raffi Barsoumian, Michael Countryman, Rachel Dratch and Reg Rogers, playing an ensemble of real-life politicians, journalists and technologists who have all contributed to the show. Here’s how the theatre bills the new play: “Privacy explores our complicated relationship with technology and data through the funny and heart-breaking travails of a lonely guy (Radcliffe), who arrives in the city to figure out how to like, tag, and share his life without giving it all away. The play uncovers what our technological choices reveal about who we are, what we want and who’s keeping track of it all. This provocative theatrical event will ask audiences to charge their phones, leave them ON during the performance and to embark on a fascinating dive online and into a new reality where we’re all connected…for better or worse.” Tickets are available by calling (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, or in person at the Taub Box Office at The Public Theater at 425 Lafayette Street, Manhattan. ||||| Be not afeard, indeed. In a clandestine confab, artists from the Public Theater and the Donmar Warehouse on Saturday met in the Lower Manhattan auditorium where “A Chorus Line” and “Hamilton” began so the actor Daniel Radcliffe (in the flesh) and the fugitive Edward J. Snowden (by video from Moscow) could run lines of Shakespeare. The odd mash-up, three years in the making, produced one of the more unusual cameos of the moment: beginning this weekend, Mr. Snowden will appear in a new play at the Public, conjured up nightly to exchange bits of “The Tempest” and ideas about privacy with Mr. Radcliffe, who plays a writer in the show. The interview/performance was a long-sought goal of the creators of “Privacy,” a British play, rewritten with an American context, that begins performances Saturday and explores how the personal has become public in the digital age. The play was conceived shortly before Mr. Snowden burst into public view, but his leaking of government documents shaped the drama. “Privacy” is a work of documentary theater, in which actors speak words taken from interviews the writers conducted with politicians, scholars and journalists. The show’s creators, James Graham and Josie Rourke, tried repeatedly to reach Mr. Snowden — they were not successful before the London production in 2014. But Mr. Snowden is now on a bit of a remote-controlled publicity tear (he has even made appearances via robot), and last week his lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union said he would do it. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Public Theater has revealed that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden will have a guest appearance in every performance of Privacy via a pre-recorded video.

It is also okay to express doubt or worries sometimes. Instead of broadcasting your thoughts, however, tell only a few close friends or your parents. This will help your confident image stay. Whether you are taking an exam or performing a competition routine for figure skating, express confidence. Use confident body language when conversing with others. Smile at others. Do not slouch. Instead, stand up tall and speak clearly. Rather than crossing your arms, keep them open or at your hips. See Make People Think You Are Confident for more tips. People who are well-rounded might seem “good” at everything because they are well-connected. In truth, they might be generalists who just try many activities. Being open to new experiences, though, is in fact a good thing. Plus, the more people you meet, the farther your reputation spreads. Consider finding friends in different areas of your school or community too. For example, if you’re into skating, you could have other skaters as friends. You might also have friends from chemistry class or choir. In addition to concrete activities, being “good” at everything, extends to your social skills. Show kindness through volunteer work or helping friends when they are in need. Listen intently when your friends tell you stories or about their problems. Give advice when they ask for it. Also, compliment others. Often, confidence comes from not having to prove your the best but in highlighting the best in others. You might consider volunteering at a soup kitchen or collecting food for the homeless. You could help your friend with her math homework. See Practice-Random-Acts-of-Kindness for more tips. No one is good at everything and absolutely no one is perfect. If you want to appear competent in what you do, that is good and fine. It is important, however, to be modest and humble. Do not brag about your successes. For example, do not say, “Wow, I went to the competition this weekend and beat everyone in the free skate. I won gold!” Instead, wait until people ask you how the competition went. Then you might say, “I did my best and was very pleased.” If they ask you what place you received, then feel free to say, “I placed first.” See Be Humble for more advice. Summary:","completion":"This article emphasizes expressing confidence, humility, and enthusiasm when discussing sports or academics, maintaining positive body language, being well-rounded and open to new experiences, fostering strong social skills, engaging in acts of kindness, and remaining modest in order to leave a positive impression and be seen as competent and well-rounded in various aspects of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: what other species have blood other than humans? Possible A: vampires, person, soccer game, capillaries, animals Why is \\"animals\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Animals\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most logical and scientifically accurate option among the possible answers provided. When considering the question, \\"What other species have blood other than humans?\\", it is important to understand that blood is a common biological component found in a wide variety of organisms, not limited to humans. To better comprehend why \\"animals\\" is the most sensible option, let us examine the other choices: 1. Vampires: Vampires are mythical creatures from folklore and popular culture. They are not real-life biological organisms, and therefore, cannot be considered an answer based on factual information. It is worth noting that even though vampires are often associated with blood in myths and stories, they are still fictional beings. 2. Person: A person is an individual human being, which means that answering \\"person\\" would be synonymous with answering \\"humans.\\" Since the question specifically asks for other species that have blood besides humans, this choice does not provide any new or relevant information. 3. Soccer game: A soccer game refers to a sporting event, which is a social and competitive human activity. It does not pertain to biological organisms or the question at hand, making it an irrelevant answer. 4. Capillaries: Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels found within the bodies of various living organisms, including humans. While capillaries are indeed related to blood, they are not a separate species, but rather a component of the vascular system. Therefore, this answer is not consistent with the context of the question. On the other hand, \\"animals\\" is a broad category that encompasses a diverse range of multicellular organisms belonging to the kingdom Animalia. Most animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, have a circulatory system with blood as a vital component. Blood serves essential functions, such as transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, supporting immune responses, and maintaining body temperature. In conclusion, \\"animals\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it correctly identifies a wide array of species with blood across the animal kingdom, while the other given options are either irrelevant or incorrect. This answer reflects our understanding of biology, taxonomy, and the shared characteristics of various living organisms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the sentence \\"In Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian, the heroine, Jeanie Deans, a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England (bold added):\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Who is quoted for saying instruments in religious services are like \\"A cow bell in a concert\\"\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"In Sir Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian, the heroine, Jeanie Deans, a Scottish Presbyterian, writes to her father about the church situation she has found in England\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"Who is quoted for saying instruments in religious services are like 'A cow bell in a concert'\\". This is because the provided sentence discusses a character named Jeanie Deans from Sir Walter Scott's 'The Heart of Midlothian' and her impressions of the church situation in England, which she communicates to her father. However, there is no mention or reference to someone speaking about using instruments in religious services, let alone them being likened to a 'cow bell in a concert.' It is important when answering a question like this to ensure that the source provided directly addresses the question asked; in this case, we would be looking for a quote from a character, historical figure, or scholar for example, specifically stating that \\"instruments in religious services are like 'A cow bell in a concert''. The saying itself suggests a critical or dismissive perspective towards the use of instruments in religious services, implying that it feels as discordant or inappropriate as a cow bell being used in a refined musical performance such as a concert. To accurately answer the question, we would need to find a source where someone specifically makes this criticism or observation. In the sentence you provided, we learn about the book 'The Heart of Midlothian', the character Jeanie Deans, and her impressions of the church situation in England, but we receive no information about this specific quote. Furthermore, without the full context of her letter or other parts of the plot, we also don't have enough information to make broader inferences about her views on the use of instruments in church, let alone the specific analogy to a cow bell in a concert. Therefore, if you have available the part where Jeanie Deans or another character in the book makes this specific statement, it would be more helpful in providing an answer to the question on who is quoted for saying instruments in religious services are something akin to a 'cow bell in a concert.'

One day, he saw some people fighting and being mean to each other, because they looked different or believed in different things. This made him very sad. Obama liked to use a thing called Twitter, where people can write short messages and share them with lots of other people. So, he decided to write a very special message to remind everyone to be nice to each other. He wrote: \\"No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion...\\" These words were from a wise man called Nelson Mandela, who had been through many difficult things in his life. Obama's message became very popular, and lots of people liked it. In fact, it became the most-liked message on Twitter ever! More than 3.1 million people liked it, which is even more than the number of likes for messages from other famous people, like Ariana Grande and Ellen DeGeneres. Obama continued to remind people about the power of love and kindness.

At the corn maze, Kayla laughs as they try to find Amy, and eventually","completion":"Kayla, Isaac, and their best friend Jake had gone to the Fall Festival on a bright and crisp October afternoon. The main attraction at the festival was a massive corn maze that spanned several acres. They had all made a pact to split up and try to beat each other to the end of the maze. To make it more interesting, they were given walkie-talkies to communicate and taunt each other along the way. As they entered at different points, Kayla couldn't contain her excitement. She felt a rush of adrenaline as she navigated through the various twists and turns of the corn maze. The tall cornstalks seemed to loom over her, feeling like gentle parents towering over their child. The sun started to set, casting golden rays over the maze that flickered between the rustling corn stalks. After some time, Isaac announced through the walkie-talkie, \\"Guys, I've reached the first checkpoint!\\" Kayla laughed as she and Jake realized that Isaac and Amy still hadn't found them yet. They were both good at hiding their presence, quickly maneuvering themselves to remain undetected. As the game continued, it started to get dark, and navigating through the maze proved to be more challenging. Kayla and Jake laughed and clowned around as they roamed the paths, calling out Amy's name occasionally, teasing her. \\"Amyyyy, where are you?\\" Kayla chuckled into the walkie-talkie. \\"We're going to win this challenge!\\" Over the walkie-talkie, Isaac's voice was full of confidence, but also somewhat anxious. \\"We'll see about that, Kayla! We've just got to find you guys first.\\" The sun had now disappeared below the horizon, and the only light came from the dimly illuminated checkpoints scattered throughout the maze. Growing concerned, Amy's voice crackled over the radio, \\"Guys, I think I'm lost. It's getting a bit creepy in here.\\" Hearing the anxiety in Amy's voice, Kayla and Jake decided they had better focus on helping her rather than winning the game. They started walking back, retracing their steps, and calling out her name. Suddenly, Kayla heard Amy's voice nearby, but it didn't come through the walkie-talkie. They found her sitting against a cornstalk, shivering from the cold. \\"Hey, guys,\\" she said with a feeble smile, \\"Thanks for finding me.\\" Together, they hugged each other, relieved to be reunited. Kayla pulled out her emergency blanket from her backpack and wrapped it around Amy's shoulders. They sat there for a moment, recalling their favorite memories from the day. As they recovered their strength and spirit, the group decided it was time to leave the maze and head home. With renewed energy, they linked up arms, worked as a team, and followed the dimly lit path toward the exit. Emerging victoriously from the corn maze, a sense of accomplishment washed over them. Despite the darkness and challenges they faced, they came out stronger through working together. In the end, they shared a bond and a memory that would last a lifetime. As they sat down by a bonfire at the Fall Festival, sipping hot apple cider and sharing the last piece of pumpkin pie, they laughed about their corn maze adventure, making plans to return next year – but this time, with a better strategy and perhaps a brighter flashlight. In a world where people often focus more on individual success, it is the moments where we come together and grow stronger as a collective that truly make life more meaningful. Kayla, Isaac, Amy, and Jake knew they would always cherish their experiences at the corn maze, for it reflected the spirit of friendship, teamwork, and the joy that comes when genuine, deep connections bring the light of love to the darkest of nights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated. Problem:Passage: The Arab man was counting his coins. The ends justify the means. Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Identify if the passage is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. Usage: Stereotype. The Arab man was counting his coins. This sentence could imply that Arab individuals are associated with money or are possibly greedy, which is a stereotype.

Part #2: Evaluate the relevance of additional information in the passage to the main classification. Usage: Unrelated. The ends justify the means. This sentence is not connected to the stereotype in the first sentence, so it has nothing to do with the stereotype classification.

Considering the passage information and its relevance, the main theme of the passage revolves around the stereotype in the first sentence about the Arab man counting his coins.

I created this Throwaway account so my friends don’t find out about my family issues on Reddit. This is one complicated shitstorm that has 14 years’ worth of back story so I’ll try my best to give you a brief and unbiased perspective. This all started 14 years ago when my parents and I lived in a small city. We were told that my aunt suddenly passed away due to mental issues and misdiagnosis one day and my uncle was a complete emotional wreck and was in no state to take care of his 6 yrs old child ( I’ll call him Aaron). Our relatives and my uncle wanted to us move cities take care of my cousin Aaron, because my uncle works in middle east and comes back home only once a year. It was a mutually beneficial for both of us. My mom always wanted the best opportunities for me and moving to a bigger city means that she’ll be able to provide them all and at same time she’ll be able to take care of Aaron and bring him up like her own son. In the beginning everything was good. My mom and dad are very strict about discipline and manners, but I’ve never seen them treat me favorably over him or vice versa. We got our asses whooped equally and treated to an ice-cream equally. But I could see something was off with my brother Aaron as he approached puberty. When he was 12 yrs. old my neighbor caught peeping through a keyhole when my mom was changing and another time my driver caught him peeping again when he was 14 yrs. old. He was creepy and started getting more and more aggressive and my mom said even his hugs were very inappropriate, but she still in my opinion treated us as equals. Thing went out of control when Aaron started spiraling into some mental issues like OCD and Depression, and his father (My uncle) had to leave his job in the middle east due to Arab spring that sent the country spiraling through a bloody civil war. He is really nice man but the trauma of losing his wife led him to pamper him and silently enable him in being absolutely disrespectful and degrading to my parents. He would treat my mom like a servant and would threaten violence against my father if he was angry. My parents decided to bear through this humiliation because I was in high school and they didn’t want to me to lose out on the best opportunities because of this asshole. Fast forward now 5 year later, I’m a 23 yrs. Old and I was able to follow my passion and graduate from a great college just like my parents hoped and I’m now employed in a different city with a decently well-paying job with enough income to support my standard of living without any financial issues. I have to mention that my parents completely funded my entire college expenses including monthly allowances. But, things at home have gotten worse. Aaron is increasing spiraling and going out of control and orders around my parents and treats them very disrespectfully. My parents especially my mom has grown to hate him and has started actively showing her displeasure. My father works as a government bureaucrat and he’s waiting for his promotion so my parents can move out of this shitshow but unfortunately due national politics and election his promotion has been delayed by 6 months. My Brother’s mental health has also steadily deteriorated, he doesn’t take his meds properly and my uncle has pampered him. My mom calls me every day and cries to me about how she gets treated and horrible my brother behaves. I feel really helpless because she doesn’t want to leave my father alone and at the same time can’t stand living there. Its horrible hearing my mom cry and I feel absolutely distraught that I can’t do anything to help her. Today I snapped and told her off, I told her to not talk to me about this and asked her to leave me alone. She says she just wants to vent to someone she can trust (like me) but I’m an introvert and have difficulty processing emotions’, I just want to left alone. I hate feeling helpless and this is taking an emotional toll on me. She blames me for being selfish and self-centered after all she’s done for me and provided me with the best opportunities even going above and beyond in some cases. AITA the asshole here? TL;DR : My parents are going through hell because of my abusive and disrespectful brother (who’s going through some mental issues), but can’t move out due to some external issues like national politics. My mom cries to me every day as a way of venting but today I snapped at her and told her to stop talking to me about this issue because I feel helpless and seeing her cry and vent out to me is taking an emotional toll on me.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, as there was a combination of issues that collectively ruined our much-anticipated getaway. First and foremost, the customer service we received from the moment we arrived was severely lacking in warmth and professionalism. The check-in process was not smooth at all, as the staff was inattentive, slow, and unable to provide us with clear directions to our room. Throughout our stay, we found that the majority of the employees seemed disinterested in addressing our concerns or providing any assistance. When we reached our room, things didn't improve. The room was not as clean as one would expect from a reputable establishment. There were stains on the sheets and what appeared to be mold in the bathroom. We immediately informed the staff about these issues, but they took their time in responding to our concerns and only did a halfhearted job in cleaning the room. Apart from the cleanliness of the room, the overall maintenance and facilities at this place left much to be desired. The plumbing issues in the bathroom persisted throughout our stay despite notifying the management multiple times. Additionally, the Wi-Fi was patchy, which made it difficult for us to stay connected or carry out essential tasks. Regarding the on-site dining options, we were not impressed with the lack of variety and the mediocre quality of the food. The breakfast buffet was substandard, with a limited selection of dishes which saw little to no improvement during our stay. Moreover, the overpriced menu items at the hotel's restaurant paled in comparison to what we could find in nearby establishments. To make matters worse, we encountered several instances of noise disturbances during our stay. It appeared that the walls were very thin, and we could hear conversations in neighboring rooms and guests walking around in the hallway. It was difficult to relax or get a good night's sleep due to these constant disruptions. One of the saving graces for this place could have been its location. However, we found that the area surrounding it was not the most ideal, with a lack of nearby attractions and limited options for dining and entertainment. While the place itself may have boasted some appealing features, like a pool or gym, they were overshadowed by the negative aspects we encountered throughout our stay. In conclusion, it saddens me to say that our experience at this place fell significantly short of our expectations. From the subpar customer service to the lack of upkeep and the unappetizing food, I cannot in good faith recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a comfortable and enjoyable getaway. My hope is that they take all these issues into account and implement changes that will make a positive difference for their future guests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: More and more birds are flying to settle at Qinghai Lake, one of the highest inland lakes in China, thanks to the protection efforts of local governments. Covering an area of over 4,000 square kilometers, Qinghai Lake is also the country's biggest salt-water lake. Located in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, the lake is famous for the two islands at its northwest point--Cormorant Island and Egg Island. The two islands have plenty of floating grass and various schools of fish, offering rich food sources for birds. The islands have become a paradise for different kinds of groups of birds and have been called 'Bird Islands'. Each March and April, when ice and snow covering the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau starts to melt, over 20 kinds of birds fly to the Bird Islands to lay eggs. During the months, flocks of birds cover the whole sky over the islands and birds eggs can be found everywhere. Visitors can hear the singing of birds from miles away. These have become a world famous symbol of the lake. To protect this paradise for birds and support calls for ecological protection, China set up the Qinghai Lake Natural Protection Zone at the end of 1997. Meanwhile, the State has pointed out the Bird Islands and Spring Bay of the Qinghai Lake as central protection zones. Inspection officials and management employees often patrol the lake, improving local residents' knowledge of related laws and spreading knowledge about animal protection to visitors. They are making great efforts to call on people to love and protect the birds. At the same time, they have built special fences around the island area, to prevent wolves, foxes and other carnivorous animals, as well as illegal hunters from breaking up the birds' nest-building, egg-laying and breeding. As a result, more and more birds are coming to the islands for sheltering and breeding.

About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does.

She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.

Movie title: Wonder Boys Context: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

And, incidentally, the first Cover Girl model as well. [ Related: Full video coverage of the 2012 Olympic Games ] Esparza defeated Karlha Magliocco of Venezuela in a women’s flyweight division bout on Monday, 24-16, advancing to the semifinals on Wednesday and a match against top-seeded favorite Cancan Ren of China at ExCel Centre. The American fighter took the first round 8-4 and then followed with a 6-4 second round. From Jake Donovan of Boxing Scene: The Venezuelan boxer was game, but struggled to keep pace as Esparza picked her apart from the outside. The American’s lead continued to grow with each passing round as Esparza left no doubt. At no point was she encouraged to sit on her lead, as he coaches continued to remind her of what she needed to correct rather than praise what was working. Esparza proved to be an A-student, following instructions to the letter and cruising to the medal round. The victory guarantees that Esparza will medal in London. The format for boxing has each of the four semifinalists earning a medal, with the winners vying for gold and silver while the semifinal losers both earn bronze. [ Related: Which sports give out four medals? ] Esparza, 23, gained fame before the London Games as a model for Cover Girl, thanks in part to her pre-match ritual: applying a light base of makeup with some blush and mascara. According to PEOPLE Magazine, she also “puts on perfume before a fight, [and] makes sure to exfoliate and hydrate her skin.” So, at the very least, her face is well maintained before someone punches it.

Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food. Suggested answer: At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"The suggested answer provides limited information about the earthworm's eating and digestion process. While it is true that peristalsis plays a role in the breakdown and movement of food in earthworms, the answer lacks specific details about the earthworm's anatomy and eating mechanisms. Based on this, the suggested answer should not be validated without further elaboration on the topic. A more comprehensive explanation of how an earthworm eats and digests food is as follows: Earthworms possess a series of specialized structures and processes that allow them to eat and digest organic matter in the soil efficiently. The earthworm's digestive system is a long, tube-like structure that extends from the mouth to the anus and includes several specialized regions, such as the pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. 1. Earthworms eat by ingesting organic matter and tiny bits of soil particles through their mouths. The prostomium, a lobe-shaped structure that serves as the anterior end of the earthworm, plays a vital role in sensing the environment and guiding the worm during the eating process. 2. The ingested food and soil particles pass through the pharynx, where the food is lubricated with mucus to facilitate swallowing. Muscle contractions in the pharynx help transport the food into the esophagus. 3. The esophagus secretes calcium carbonate, which helps neutralize the acidic environment in the soil and aids in the digestion process. The food then moves from the esophagus to the crop. 4. The crop serves as a storage chamber for the ingested food and soil particles. It is a relatively thin-walled structure that holds the food before it is gradually transferred to the gizzard for further processing. 5. The gizzard is a robust, muscular part of the earthworm's digestive system. It utilizes muscular contractions and grinding action to mechanically break down the food and soil particles into smaller pieces. This process is essential for increasing the surface area of the material, allowing digestive enzymes to work more effectively. 6. After being processed in the gizzard, the food moves into the intestine, where chemical digestion takes place. The intestinal walls secrete digestive enzymes that break down complex organic molecules, such as proteins, into simpler compounds that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Furthermore, symbiotic microorganisms within the intestine assist in breaking down cellulose and other complex carbohydrates, contributing significantly to the earthworm's nutrition. 7. The digested food is absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream and distributed to the rest of the body to provide energy and essential nutrients. 8. The undigested and inorganic materials, such as small soil particles, pass through the remainder of the intestine and are excreted from the earthworm's body as small, cylindrical castings known as worm poop. In conclusion, the complete process of how an earthworm eats and digests food involves a series of anatomical structures and multiple steps, including ingestion, mechanical breakdown, chemical digestion, and absorption of nutrients. Peristalsis, as mentioned in the suggested answer, plays an essential role in moving food and soil particles along the digestive tract during this process. However, to provide a more accurate and comprehensive explanation, the complete context and sequence of events need to be described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the question about text: As JJ and I enjoyed a nice cappuccino and Turkish coffee with some honey cake we spent a couple of hours watching people react to this fountain ..... the reactions were widely varied and most entertaining . Most of the visitors wanted their picture taken in front of the fountain , some in rather erotic positions . Many of the women , and some of the men , actually \\" held \\" certain parts of the statue . Here is a video that JJ took in the weeee hours of the morning , before the stinking tourists appeared . Why did some not like the photos taken ?","completion":"Based on the given text, we can infer several possible reasons why some people might not have liked the photos taken. 1. Varied reactions to the fountain: As the text mentions, the reactions to the fountain were widely varied, indicating that people have different perceptions and opinions about it. Some might be amused, while others might be offended or uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted by the fountain. Therefore, those who found the fountain offensive or inappropriate might not have liked the photos taken in front of it. 2. Erotic positions: Some visitors chose to take photos in \\"rather erotic positions\\" in front of the fountain. It can be assumed that this behavior might have made some other people uncomfortable or even upset, as they may consider such actions disrespectful or distasteful. Consequently, those who disapproved of the suggestive poses might not have liked or appreciated the photos taken. 3. Physical interaction with the statue: Many of the women and some of the men actually \\"held\\" certain parts of the statue while posing for pictures. This interaction with the statue may have been viewed as disrespectful, improper, or even vulgar by some visitors. As a result, people who found this behavior to be inappropriate might not have liked the photos captured with the statue. 4. Overcrowded tourist spot: The text indicates that JJ took the video in the \\"weeee hours of the morning, before the stinking tourists appeared.\\" This suggests that the place might get crowded with tourists during the day, and not all visitors were happy with the influx of people. Some individuals might not have liked the photos taken because they wanted to enjoy a more authentic or peaceful experience, away from the swarm of tourists, and capturing these moments might have felt intrusive. 5. Invasion of privacy: People's reactions to the fountain were captured and observed by the narrator and JJ without their explicit permission. Some visitors might not have liked the fact that they were being watched and judged by others and their private moments were being recorded, especially if they were engaged in actions considered inappropriate or embarrassing. In summary, reasons for disliking the photos taken at the fountain can stem from various factors, such as individual preferences, discomfort with suggestive or provocative behavior, concerns about respect and propriety, aversion to crowded tourist spots, and privacy issues. These factors, singly or combined, can contribute to some individuals' negative reactions to the photos captured around the fountain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible answers: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","completion":"(b). it is not possible to tell. A detailed explanation: Based on the given premise, we can infer that the company has expanded its central security group to manage the security of its main network and decentralized computer operations. However, it is not possible to definitively confirm whether the hypothesis \\"The security of the company has increased tremendously\\" is true, due to the lack of specific information and measurable outcomes provided. There are several factors to consider in order to evaluate the company's security improvements, which are not addressed in the premise: 1. Quality of the security personnel: Although the company has grown to include 12 individuals, the expertise and experience of these individuals are crucial for effectively securing the company's network and computer operations. The premise does not provide any information regarding their qualifications. 2. Implementation of security measures: Merely increasing the size of the central security group is not necessarily an indicator of improved security. The effectiveness of the security measures and protocols put in place, as well as the technologies and tools used, would need to be evaluated to determine any improvements in security. 3. Timeframe: The premise does not specify a timeframe for the growth of the central group. The time period over which this expansion has occurred could offer valuable context for evaluating the company's current security status. 4. Comparison to industry standards and best practices: To accurately assess whether the company's security has increased tremendously, its current security measures should be compared to industry standards and best practices. The premise does not provide any information regarding this. 5. Quantifiable metrics: A true evaluation of the company's security improvements would require quantifiable metrics, such as reductions in security breaches or improvements in the detection and resolution of cyber threats. These metrics are not provided in the premise. In conclusion, given the limited information provided in the premise, it is not possible to definitively confirm whether the hypothesis \\"The security of the company has increased tremendously\\" is true. Further information on factors such as personnel qualifications, security measures, industry comparisons, and quantifiable metrics would be needed to make an informed assessment."},{"prompt":"This is a correct answer to the following question about Tropical cyclone.

She was eager to explore the world and learn about everything she possibly could. Her endless curiosity often led her to ask her parents countless questions. At times, her parents were amazed by her intelligence, but occasionally, they grew worried about the potential consequences of her curiosity. One day, Eliza's mother noticed that her daughter had been spending a considerable amount of time looking at a mysterious book from the town's old library. The book was titled \\"The Secrets of the Enchanted Forest,\\" and it supposedly contained a series of magical spells, curious creatures, and hidden treasure maps. Eliza's mother was wary of the book because she had heard the tales and warnings from her own mother about the Enchanted Forest. In an attempt to keep her daughter safe, Eliza's mother told her, \\"My dear, I understand how curious you are but please be cautious. Remember that not everything in this world is as innocuous as it seems. Promise me that you'll never go searching for the Enchanted Forest.\\" Eliza, however, was already too intrigued by the book's captivating stories and beautiful illustrations to heed her mother's warning. In her youthful innocence, she believed the Enchanted Forest would be a magical place filled with wondrous adventure and discovery. One sunny afternoon, while her parents were out running errands, Eliza decided to slip outside with the book clutched tightly under her arm. She spent several hours searching until, eventually, she stumbled upon the entrance to the elusive Enchanted Forest. As she walked deeper into the forest, Eliza began to notice that things were not as enchanting as she had imagined. The sun no longer shined through the dense canopy, casting eerie shadows and causing the temperature to drop rapidly. She soon encountered some of the mysterious creatures depicted in the book, which were far more hostile and fearsome than she had anticipated. The deeper Eliza ventured into the forest, the more she realized that she was in danger. She began to desperately search for a way out as she tried to retrace her steps. The magical spells she had read about in the book were no help; instead, they seemed to create more confusion and peril. As the sun began to set, Eliza finally stumbled upon a small, ancient hut hidden deep within the woods. Inside, she found a wise old woman who revealed herself to be the guardian of the Enchanted Forest. The old woman explained that the forest was designed to test and challenge anyone who dared to enter, as it was meant to protect the vast treasures hidden within. Eliza implored the old woman to help her find her way home. The wise guardian agreed to help but offered a final warning: \\"The world is filled with wonders and dangers alike. Always remember to listen to the wisdom of those who love and care about you.\\" Exhausted and relieved, Eliza returned to her home, grateful to be alive. She reflected on her harrowing adventure and came to understand the wisdom in her mother's words.

In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer.

Her father was a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1952 and taught his native language. Her mother, of German and Italian descent, is the daughter of artists. Krauss grew up in the college town of Champaign, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Krauss' second Union Station album Every Time You Say Goodbye was released in 1992, and she went on to win her second Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album of the year. She then joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1993 at the age of 21. She was the youngest cast member at the time, and the first bluegrass artist to join the Opry in twenty-nine years. She also collaborated on a project with the Cox Family in 1994, a bluegrass album called I Know Who Holds Tomorrow. Mandolin and guitar player Dan Tyminski replaced Tim Stafford in Union Station in 1994. Late in the year, Krauss recorded with the band Shenandoah on its single \\"Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart\\", which brought her to the country music Top Ten for the first time and it won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Also in 1994, Krauss collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Kathy Mattea, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to contribute \\"Teach Your Children\\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997, she recorded vocals and violin for \\"Half a Mind\\", on Tommy Shaw's 7 Deadly Zens album. Now That I've Found You: A Collection, a compilation of older releases and some covers of her favorite works by other artists, was released in 1995. Some of these covers include Bad Company's \\"Oh Atlanta\\", The Foundations' & Dan Schafer's \\"Baby, Now That I've Found You\\", which was used in the Australian hit comedy movie The Castle, and The Beatles' \\"I Will\\". A cover of Keith Whitley's \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\" reached number three on the Billboard country chart; the album peaked in the top fifteen on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, and sold two million copies to become Krauss' first double-platinum album. Krauss also was nominated for four Country Music Association Awards and won all of them. So Long So Wrong, another Union Station album, was released in 1997 and won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album. One critic said its sound was \\"rather untraditional\\" and \\"likely [to] change quite a few ... minds about bluegrass.\\" Included on the album is the track \\"It Doesn't Matter\\", which was featured in the second-season premiere episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and was included on the Buffy soundtrack in 1999. Her next solo release in 1999, Forget About It, included one of her two tracks to appear on the Billboard adult contemporary chart, \\"Stay\\".

People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who is most generally associated with his piano arrangement of the folk dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\"? from the following article ? Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 1882 – 20 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who lived in the United States from 1914 on and became a citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year...

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the contemporary style that descended from the one recorded in a journal in 1849?, using the article: Hachijō-daiko (八丈太鼓, trans. \\"Hachijō-style taiko\\") is a taiko tradition originating on the island of Hachijō-jima. Two styles of Hachijō-daiko emerged and have been popularized among residents: an older tradition based on a historical account, and a newer tradition influenced by mainland groups and practiced by the majority of the islanders.The Hachijō-daiko tradition was documented as early as 1849 based on a journal kept by an exile named Kakuso Kizan. He mentioned some of its unique features, such as \\"a taiko is suspended from a tree while women and children gathered around\\", and observed that a player used either side of the drum while performing. Illustrations from Kizan's journal show features of Hachijō-daiko. These illustrations also featured women performing, which is unusual as taiko performance elsewhere during this period was typically reserved for men. Teachers of the tradition have noted that the majority of its performers were women; one estimate asserts that female performers outnumbered males by three to one. The first style of Hachijō-daiko is thought to descend directly from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the shita-byōshi (下拍子, \\"lower beat\\"), provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the uwa-byōshi (上拍子, \\"upper beat\\"), builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.The contemporary style of Hachijō-daiko is called shin-daiko (新太鼓, \\"new taiko\\"), which differs from Kumaoji-daiko in multiple ways. For instance, while the lead and accompanying roles are still present, shin-daiko..., what would be the answer ?

Although the user appreciates the idea of taking Stephen Foster's music into the concert hall and acknowledges that the instrumentals are quite good, there are several critical issues they point out. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the countertenor's performance did not work well with Stephen Foster's music style. The reviewer suggests that the countertenor, Jeffrey Dooley, who is known for his repertoire of Handel and Purcell, may not be as successful when it comes to performing Stephen Foster's music. This indicates that the user found it to be an incompatible pairing, which could detract from their overall enjoyment of the performance. Secondly, the user describes the recording quality as being poor. They say that Jeffrey Dooley's performance sounds like it was recorded inside a box, which created a high-pitched echo. This unpleasant sound effect made it difficult for the user to follow the lyrics and even hurt their ears. This issue with the recording quality is a significant deterrent for the user's recommendation, as it can negatively impact the listening experience of potential consumers. Despite the reviewer giving the album a two-star rating for its good instrumentals, the combination of the performance not working well with the music and the poor recording quality makes it unlikely that the user would recommend this product.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command.

Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment.

Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth.

This isn’t as clear cut as the title may suggest and is different enough from other DUI reporting stories that I don’t know how to feel. I’m good friends with some people who often hang out with this guy named “John” (names changed), one of my friend’s brother. To me, John is exactly the kind of person I hate. He’s very successful academically and socially. However, he uses his talents to be just enough of an asshole to get away with everything, meaning no one ever calls him out on his shit and no consequences come from his behavior. He’s untouchable. Example: John was telling a story once and his dad asked him to repeat something and in front of everyone, John got very snarky with him - claiming if he cared, he would have heard him the first time (this logic still doesn’t make sense to me) and that he shouldn’t have to repeat himself. John is usually this rude to his parents, but his dad was particularly upset from John lashing out at him this time since it was a party in celebration of John’s graduation. No one has ever said anything about this incident to him. Going back to the AITA scenario, we were having a party for someone’s birthday and John is talking about how surprised he is about his brother, my good friend, is drinking and “not just being boring like he always is” and that he might even make some friends. This is something he usually says about his brother but for some reason, this time it just made me snap. I knew his dumbass would think he would be good to drive home even if he wasn’t. Sure enough, when he decided it was a good time to go, he said he was going to drive back home. As he drove away, I anonymously called the police and reported him for drunk driving. He was pulled over and got in a heap of trouble. As the police started to approach him, he panicked and tried to get away for a second until he became sensible and stopped. He blew a .08 and is getting a DUI. Now there’s a very real possibility that he won’t be able to get into the medical schools he wants to and he is really really upset about it.

I feel kind of bad for what I did, but since I did it anonymously, I don’t have anyone to discuss this with. I just want to hear what other people think. AITA? P.S: I don’t want to paint John one dimensionally. He can be very nice and from I understand. Since his girlfriend of 2 years hasn’t dumped him yet, he’s probably not too awful to her.

Australian authorities say that ISIS leaders ordered followers to behead someone on Australian soil as a \\"demonstration killing.\\" Prosecutors say they uncovered a plot that was \\"clearly designed to shock and horrify\\" the public. Now that President Barack Obama has announced the United States will seek to degrade and destroy ISIS, should Americans worry they will become targets for similar plots from this ruthless terrorist group? ISIS has worked diligently to taunt the U.S. and its allies. The alleged plot in Australia, which triggered that country's largest ever anti-terrorist dragnet, is only the most recent example. Even before ISIS became well-known, British soldier Lee Rigby was butchered in a London street last year. There is a real possibility that Americans, too, will face the threat of such \\"demonstration killings\\" on U.S. soil. The news from Australia comes on the heels of recent videotaped decapitations of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The ISIS killer mocks the American President and addresses him personally in the Sotloff video: \\"I'm back, Obama. ... I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring out troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan.\\" The militant claims to want an end to American missile strikes against the group. But everything ISIS does seems to indicate the opposite. It's hard not to escape the impression that ISIS wants to be attacked by the United States, by its Western allies and by the rest of the world. Killing Americans and broadcasting their beheadings; slaying a British citizen the same way; calling for the deaths of Australians in the streets of Sidney -- these all seem designed to stoke fury in the West against the Islamist extremists. Is ISIS on a suicide mission? Not really. ISIS wants the United States to join in the fight. But that does not mean the U.S. should ignore the threat. Obama should deal with ISIS carefully. The group is extremely dangerous and allowing it to continue scoring victories would be disastrous. Still, ISIS efforts to draw America into its vortex are telling. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi believes he has much to gain by turning this into a war between his forces -- whom he perceives as representatives of Islam -- and the United States, the most powerful military force in the world. Washington is trying to enlist a wide-ranging coalition to fight against ISIS, and it is enlisting other Muslim-majority Arab states to participate. It is crucial that ISIS not be allowed to portray this battle as a war pitting Muslims against non-Muslims. It is a fight between a blood-thirsty extremist organization that embraces a brutal interpretation of Islam against those who disagree with ISIS' goals, methods and ideology. The United States is the country with the power to tip the scales, but it is hardly ISIS' main enemy. As a former ISIS fighter told CNN, \\"The main and principal goal of the Islamic State that they tell their new members is to establish an Islamic state that will encompass the Arab world,\\" he said. \\"And after that, we go to other countries.\\" For al-Baghdadi, fighting America and its coalition of 40 countries is a badge of honor, a powerful recruiting tool. It is proof that he and his organization have become the leaders of global jihad, toppling al Qaeda, their rival in that contest. ISIS was once part of al Qaeda (it was once called al Qaeda in Iraq), but its tactics proved too extreme even for the perpetrators of 9/11, which predicted public beheadings of Muslims would turn other Muslims against the group. Now ISIS has become more powerful than al Qaeda. Al-Baghdadi has conquered more than Osama bin Laden dared to dream he might do in his lifetime. But that does not mean al-Baghdadi did not learn from his former leader. As bin Laden explained, \\"When people see a strong horse, by nature they will like the strong horse.\\" Nothing makes for a stronger horse, a more powerful draw in the world of jihad, than fighting America. Until now, ISIS has achieved enormous victories, adding to its allure, but these are likely inebriating the group with the poisonous brew of hubris. ISIS has scored battlefield victories against Syrian government forces, rival Syrian opposition fighters, the Iraqi military and even the storied Kurdish Peshmerga militias. By now, al-Baghdadi and his men may be feeling invincible. They may believe they have all the power of God on their side. This is where hubris comes in. This is where they risk overplaying their hand. The killings of Foley and Sotloff already jolted the American public and their war-weary president out of the all-pervasive post-Iraq War opposition to entering a new conflict in the Middle East. ISIS is a threat that cannot be ignored. ISIS' atrocities in Syria, along with all the killing in that country, were receiving little attention until the Syrian civil war boiled over into Iraq, and ISIS swept across the border it says does not exist. Now that al-Baghdadi and his men have started challenging and defying the West, they have finally captured attention beyond the Middle East. With every step they have taken beyond Syria, with every move closer to American, British, Australian or European interests, they have given new impetus to international involvement. Even Obama, the most reluctant of commanders in chief, has decided to act. For three years, Obama had resisted calls to arm Syrian rebels despite some 200,000 killed in that country's civil war. ISIS has suddenly changed that equation with its sweep in Iraq, endangering America's friends, the Kurds, threatening genocide against the Yazidis and then ostentatiously killing American citizens. According to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, officials had firm evidence that an attack on a \\"random\\" Australian citizen was in the works. \\"This is not just suspicion,\\" he said. The Australian people \\"are at serious risk from a terrorist attack.\\" In al-Baghdadi's calculus, an attack on Australians -- or any Westerners -- would produce propaganda and recruiting gains. ISIS is gambling that drawing America and the West into the fight will make it stronger, but if the West is strategic and smart, this move will prove to be ISIS' worst mistake.

Article: Britain's private schools are one of its most successful exports.The children of the well-off flock to them,whether from China,Nigeria or Russia :the number of foreign pupils rose by 1.4%in the last year alone. Yet foreign students,whether educated in British private schools or elsewhere,are decreasingly likely to go to English universities.According to the Higher Education Funding Council for England,307,200 overseas students began their studies in the country in 2012-13,down from 312,000 two years earlier and the first drop in 29 years.Student numbers from the rest of the European Union(EU)fell--probably a result of the increase in annual tuition fees in England from PS6,000(10,000)a year to PS9,000.But arrivals from India and Pakistan declined most sharply. In contrast to the visa system for private schools,which is extremely loose(the Home Office counts private schools as favoured sponsors),student visas have been tightened.Foreign students used to be allowed to work for up to two years after graduating.They now have only four months to find a job paying up to PS20,600 if they want to stay in Britain. This change was intended to deal with fake colleges offering two-year work visas.But it seems to have put off serious students too.Nick Hillman of the Higher Education Policy Institute says the government has sent unclear messages about the sort of immigration it wants to restrict.Australia and America,which have more relaxed entry criteria for students,are becoming more favoured destinations. Britain's student-visa system bas become more onerous overall.As a result,Britain is losing out to other countries in the contest for talent.Its unwelcoming attitude will harm its long-term development.And the drift of foreign students from leading British private schools to American colleges may have another, somewhat happier,consequence:America might become rather better at cricket .

A recent article in theWall Street Journalblamed Facebook's ability to ruin friendships, saying that it limits communication to typing and encourages people to spend far too much time with friends they have never met. Having used Facebook since its first year, I find these arguments false. The simple truth is that the problems are only a symptom of Facebook abuse. Like many things, it is only as harmful to your life and relationships as you allow it to be. Consider arguments against watching too much TV and overeating. Try using Facebook to find friends who may have long ago changed their e-mail addresses and phone numbers, to find out what your old college friends are up to, to congratulate your friends on their latest birthdays, to share pictures and articles you find interesting, and to join in the discussion about them with your friends. Sure, I had days when I wasted a little more time on Facebook than I should, but I'm not going to blame Facebook for my own laziness. If Facebook wasn't there, I would have found something else to waste time on. To my \\"friends\\": if you don't feel like broadcasting your life stories on your Facebook, don't.

Bees are in trouble, any entomologist will tell you. Honeybee colonies in the United States have suffered devastating losses in recent years. But colony collapse disorder, as it’s called, affects only the species kept in beehives — the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. There are almost 20,000 species of wild bees, and they aren’t faring well, either. Nearly a third of bumblebee species in the United States are declining. In the Netherlands, more than half of the country’s 357 species of wild bees are endangered. Many species of plants, including crops, depend on wild bees to spread their pollen. When they lose their pollinators, they may suffer, too. “It’s essential to know what is causing those declines,” said Jeroen Scheper, a graduate student at Alterra, a research institution at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. But it is not enough to consider the many challenges — from pesticides to parasites — that wild bees face right now. “We need to go back in time,” said Mr. Scheper. Mr. Scheper and other scientists have tried to solve this puzzle by taking advantage of the patient — some might say obsessive — work of naturalists over the past 140 years. Through much of North America and Europe, these unsung heroes carefully tallied sightings of bees year after year. They caught bees, stuck them on pins, and stored their desiccated little bodies by the thousands in museum cabinets. Those impaled bees have been resting in their darkened drawers, waiting for scientists to pay them a visit. And now they have. Recently, Ignasi Baromeus, then a post-doctoral researcher at Rutgers University, and his colleagues tapped this vast supply to reconstruct the history of bees in the Northeast. They searched the bee collections at the American Museum of Natural History, the New York State Museum, and a number of university collections. All told, they examined more than 40,000 wild bees. They whittled their survey down to just 30,000 specimens for which there was clear information about when and where they had been caught. Studying the 438 species in their database, they found that the diversity of wild bumblebee species in the region declined by 30 percent between 1872 to 2011. (The diversity of the bees overall declined by a more moderate 15 percent.) As scientists gain a better understanding of the history of bees, they are also starting to gather clues about what has been driving the changes they are documenting. In their new study, published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mr. Scheper and his colleagues analyzed detailed records about bees in the Netherlands to determine how their populations changed during the twentieth century. Then the scientists looked for what the declining species had in common. They examined a number of possible factors — how common bee species were at the beginning of the century, for example, and how far they typically flew to find food, and how big they grew. The scientists were even able to study what bees ate all those decades ago. Mr. Scheper and his colleagues visited seven Dutch museums, where they inspected the bee collections. When they peered closely at the insects, they could see pollen grains stuck to the legs of some them. Placing the pollen grains under a microscope, the scientists identified the plants that the bees had visited. As it turned out, the fate of the bees often was tied to that of the plants they depended on. The growing intensity of farming in the Netherlands since the 1950s hit many wild plant species hard. “There were a lot more flowers in the landscape before,” said Mr. Scheper. Dutch farmers cleared more land, used more toxic herbicides, and blanketed their farms with fertilizers. Some wild plants were able to survive these challenges, but others became scarce. Mr. Scheper and his colleagues found that the bees that preferred declining plants also declined. This link held true even for bees that collect pollen from dozens of plant species. The results suggest that without the preferred kind of pollen, the bee larvae suffered. Mr. Scheper and his colleagues also found that big bees were at greater risk than small ones. He suspects that is because big bees need to eat more. If the plants they depend on get harder to find, they are more likely to suffer than smaller bees. “The results are compelling and make a lot of sense,” said Dr. Baromeus, who was not involved in the Dutch study. “If your food source is declining, your populations will suffer.” Laura A. Burkle, an ecologist at the University of Montana who also was not involved in the new study, cautioned that food might not be the only explanation for the results. The changes in landscape that stripped away pollen might also have ruined bee nesting sites. “We don’t have a solid understanding of which of these main resources is most limiting to bees,” said Dr. Burkle. Mr. Scheper said that policies for restoring bees will have to take their preferred plants into account. “If you want to slow down or reverse the decline of a species, you can’t suffice with general measures,” he said. “Bee species that need red clover are not helped with dandelions. I know that policy makers prefer a simple and quick answer — ‘Just do this and you’ll get this.’ — but it’s not that simple.”","completion":"\\"Unraveling the Past to Save the Future: Studying Bee Decline and Its Implications\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Emotional Arithmetic Movie plot: Emotional Arithmetic focuses primarily on three people who formed a bond in the Drancy internment camp, where they were imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II: Jakob Bronski (Sydow), who saw goodness in two orphaned children in the camp, Melanie (Sarandon) and Christopher (Byrne), and who helped them to survive. Decades after their release from Drancy, their emotional wounds still affect their lives in different ways when they meet again. Now in her 50s, Melanie is married to David Winters (Plummer), a cold and grouchy older professor of history, who was once her teacher and who has been unfaithful to her with his current students. A now-elderly poet, Jakob, having survived the gulag, has recently been released from a Russian psychiatric hospital. Christopher, a non-Jewish Irishman who had been interred at Drancy by mistake, now works as an entomologist in Paris.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a \\"Walton Edition\\" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the Chandos Records \\"Walton Edition\\" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar's Feast, the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set.

Here is an article: Last year, the Guardian’s Alex Needham described the roving Future Music Festival ( ) as being an “old-style Glastonbury in reverse”. The comparison is appropriate. Instead of being an all rock line-up with a token dance tent, this is a full-on dance/techno/house assault on the senses (mostly visual and audial) with the very occasional – definitely out-of-place – indie/dance crossover act thrown in. This year it’s the fate of French rock band Phoenix and Melbourne’s Cut Copy on the Safari stage to suffer the indignity of scant support while their more popular dance brethren are tearing the place apart. We don’t manage to catch Phoenix – unable to drag our eyes away from the hypnotic sight of Canadian electronic wizard Deadmau5 in full effect on the Future Music stage – but we do, however manage to see Cut Copy play out their watered-down New Order to a dwindling troupe of devotees before taking recourse in the zoned-out trance of original German techno pioneer Sven Väth at the Cocoon stage: a weird little spot that feels like a railway platform right in front of the teeming crowds of punters attempting to gain access to the popular inside arena, Knife Party’s Haunted House. Cut Copy claim to be Australian electronica, but this feels like pure Spike Island 1990 to us. Take it from one who were there. And it doesn’t feel right at all: not when Hardwell is pulsing out teeth-rattling bass and wielding a confetti cannon, not when Knife Party (remember the Flying Lizards-esque Internet Friends?) are perched high up in their DJ booth, lords of all they survey –flame and light and the occasional jarring rhythm. Future Music is definitely a male province: from the acts themselves to the topless lads swaggering through the showgrounds, brushing muscles and tats outdone only by their sunburned pecs. The de rigeur uniform of the day for women, meanwhile, is cut-off jeans (or, preferably, faux leather shorts) with halter necks, and when the crowd cameras focus in on the audience – which they do relentlessly on the main (Future Music) stage – it is invariably to rest upon yet another girl shaking her stuff on her bloke’s shoulders. Into all of this unashamed testosterone, the presence of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis comes as a welcome relief. Some claim that the Seattle-based former addict Macklemore is the biggest rapper in the world right now: it ain’t hard to see why, though perhaps surprising. Awesome showmanship and a jazz-inflected brass section and dancers tight enough to give the illusion of being crazily loose, coupled with a righteous social conscience that manifests itself in numbers like the inspirational Same Love (dedicated today to the Australian government in the hope that it will legitimise gay marriage) and the wickedly sussed Thrift Shop. He says we are the best-looking people in the world, us living right here in Brisbane … and you know what? We believe him. The only real surprise is why Macklemore is on so early – 5.15, and the sun ain’t even gone down yet. Eric Prydz is – for us, at least – a bit of a revelation. Known primarily in the mainstream for the rather nauseous hyper-sexualisation of women working out in the video to Call On Me, live he’s nothing like that. Instead, we get a good solid hour of prime EDM from the Swedish DJ/producer, with some stunning lasers to match: sometimes, they seem to cover the pulsating crowd like a fluorescent green security blanket. Each time the music can’t become more ecstatic he ramps it up a step, seamless. The night belongs to the progressive house of Deadmau5, though. He begins downbeat and almost quiet, like we’re going through a collective comedown following Hardwell’s elated set. The beats are weirdly unsettling and constantly surprising, shifting, the word INFERNUS folding and unfolding across the stage into fiery satanic patterns; his eerie Mouse-like mask with its crosses for eyes and grotesquely distorted ears leering out at us. For 30 minutes or so, we’re kept tantalised, on the verge of euphoria – even as the computer-generated visuals mesmerise in their continuous flow between iconographic imagery (sea monkey ads, Pinball Wizard arcades, racing cars) and the abstract and free-willed (a roving snake, 3-D smoke effects billowing out into the audience). By the time Joel Thomas Zimmerman has removed his mask, and the crowd-churning The Longest Road starts up – punctuated with an occasional well-placed FUCK to up the tempo – it feels like he’s punched a hole through the firmament and is dragging us through the other side, such is the relentless variety and kaleidoscopic beauty of the visuals and trance-inducing beats.

Posting the notice in a public place increases the likelihood of reaching a diverse set of individuals in a community, allowing for better participation and engagement. In comparison, the other options may not provide the same level of accessibility and exposure: 1. Hallway: A hallway typically offers limited visibility and may only target specific audiences, such as individuals who live or work in a linked building. This could exclude a significant portion of the target audience. 2. Store window or shop window: While these two options may yield moderate visibility, they're still confined to a specific location. People who do not shop or pay attention to those specific stores may miss the notice completely. 3. Pole: Poles can offer some visibility, but their vision might be obstructed by parked cars, trees, or other urban infrastructure. Additionally, poles may not be at eye level, thus reducing the chance of reaching a wider audience. To sum up, posting the paper sign in a public place ensures that the notice about the civic meeting will be accessible to the largest number of people and will facilitate better participation and representation of the community in the civic meeting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking On the Ph.D. Later in Life “Students are asking what they can do with the rest of their lives, and how they can have an impact,” she said. “They are approaching graduate school as a learning process for challenging themselves intellectually, but also along cognitive and emotional lines.” Making a home for older students also makes business sense for universities and colleges, said Barbara Vacarr, director of the higher education initiative at Encore.org, a nonprofit organization focused on midlife career change. “The convergence of an aging population and an undersupply of qualified traditional college students are both a call to action and an opportunity for higher education.” Some schools are serving older students in midcareer with pragmatic doctoral programs that can be completed more quickly than the seven or eight years traditionally required to earn a Ph.D. Moreover, many of those do not require candidates to spend much time on campus or even leave their full-time jobs. That flexibility can help with the cost of obtaining a doctorate. In traditional programs, costs can range from 20,000 a year to 50,000 or more — although for some, tuition expenses are offset by fellowships. The shorter programs are less costly. The total cost at Fielding, for example, is 60,000. Susan Noyes, an occupational therapist in Portland, Me., with 20 years’ experience under her belt, returned to school at age 40 for a master’s degree in adult education at the University of Southern Maine, then pursued her Ph.D. at Lesley University in Cambridge, Mass. During that time, she continued to work full time and raise three children. She finished the master’s at 44 — a confidence-builder that persuaded her to work toward a Ph.D. in adult learning, which she earned at age 49. Dr. Noyes, 53, made two visits annually to Lesley’s campus during her doctoral studies, usually for a week to 10 days. She now works as an assistant professor of occupational therapy at the University of Southern Maine. At the outset of her graduate education, Dr. Noyes wasn’t looking for a career change. Instead, she wanted to update her skills and knowledge in the occupational therapy field. But she soon found herself excited by the chance to broaden her intellectual horizons. “I’ve often said I accidentally got my Ph.D.,” she said. Lisa Goff took the traditional Ph.D. path, spending eight years getting her doctorate in history. An accomplished business journalist, she decided to pursue a master’s degree in history at the University of Virginia in 2001 while working on a book project. Later, she decided to keep going for her doctorate, which she earned in 2010, the year she turned 50. Her research is focused on cultural history, with a special interest in landscapes. Dr. Goff had planned to use the degree to land a job in a museum, but at the time, museum budgets were being cut in the struggling economy. Instead, a university mentor persuaded her to give teaching a try. She started as an adjunct professor in the American studies department at the University of Virginia, which quickly led to a full-time nontenure-track position. This year, her fourth full year teaching, her position was converted to a tenure-track job. “I thought an academic job would be grueling — not what I wanted at all,” she recalls. “But I love being in the classroom, finding ways to get students to contribute and build rapport with them.” As a graduate student, she never found the age gap to be a challenge. “Professors never treated me as anything but another student, and the other students were great to me,” Dr. Goff said. The toughest part of the transition, she says, was the intellectual shock of returning to a rigorous academic environment. “I was surprised to see just how creaky my classroom muscles were,” she recalled. “I really struggled in that first class just to keep up.” Mr. Hevey agrees, saying he has experienced more stress in his academic life than in the business world. “I’m using my brain in such a different way now. I’m learning something new every day.” His advice to anyone considering a similar move? “Really ask yourself if this is something you want to do. If you think it would just be nice to be a student again, that’s wrong. It’s not a life of ease: You’ll be working all the time, perhaps for seven or eight years.” Mr. Hevey does not expect to teach, but he does hope to work in a laboratory or do research. “I’m certainly not going to start a new career at 66 or 67,” he said. “But I’m not going to go home and sit on the couch, either.” Make the most of your money.

(CNN) -- For one group of women in Chicago on Sunday, Mother's Day was marked not with flowers, but with a stark reminder of their loss. One by one, they filed toward a newly unveiled sculpture at the city's St. Sabina Church, placing small white cards emblazoned with names such as Blair Holt and Matthew Michael Rodriguez at the foot of the two figures in the sculpture. For some of the women, the realistic work of a faceless, gun-wielding assailant killing a young girl was too much to bear, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Instead of being celebrated by their children this holiday, these mothers were mourning the deaths of their children -- all victims of gun violence on Chicago's streets. \\"Today, as I woke up, instead of what a lot of mothers get, which are flowers or Happy Mom's Day or a kiss, I didn't get any of that,\\" said Maria Ramirez, whose son, Matthew, was killed at 16. \\"I don't even get to hear anybody say 'Mama' anymore. I'll never hear that again.\\" The sculpture's artist, J.S. Kenar, said he was trying to \\"show the pain, to show that something unhuman is going on here.\\" The city has been plagued by bloodshed on its streets this year, including a particularly deadly stretch last month in which seven people were killed and 18 wounded in a 12-hour period. Statistics released Sunday by Chicago police show that while the overall violent crime rate has decreased by 11 percent this year, the city's homicide rate has risen 8 percent. As of Saturday, 127 killings have been recorded this year -- three more homicides than the 2008 yearly total. \\"We cannot ignore the destructive nature of guns, and how their presence can escalate a volatile situation into a tragic one,\\" police Superintendent Jody Weis said in a statement announcing the statistics. Annette Holt knows firsthand how destructive gun violence can be to a family. Her son, Blair, an honor student at Chicago's Percy L. Julian high school, was shot on a city bus in 2007. He was killed in a hail of gang bullets when he jumped into the line of fire to save the life of a teenage girl. He was 16. At Sunday's unveiling, Holt implored other mothers to do all they can to stop the cycle of violence. \\"Do something to make a difference now before you're like us (and) your child is either in the cemetery for Mother's Day or birthdays, or your child is in jail for 100 years,\\" she said.

Q:The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, though with less detail and depth. In the first sentence, \\"Arts and crafts are held in high regard in Edinburgh,\\" the main piece of information being conveyed is that the city of Edinburgh places significant importance or value on arts and crafts. This can be interpreted as meaning that there is a strong appreciation for arts and crafts among the people living in Edinburgh, and the city may likely be known for having a thriving scene related to various art forms and craftsmanship. While the first sentence gives us a clear picture of the level of importance and cultural significance that arts and crafts enjoy in Edinburgh, the second sentence somewhat simplifies that notion. In the second sentence, \\"Edinburgh enjoys arts and crafts,\\" the main idea is that the city has an affinity for arts and crafts, or that they are generally liked or appreciated by the city's population. This sentence doesn't necessarily imply the level of importance or high regard as explicitly, but it does entail the idea that arts and crafts are seen positively in Edinburgh. So, the second sentence can be understood as entailed by the first sentence, since both mention that Edinburgh has a positive attitude towards arts and crafts. However, the second sentence offers a more generalized perspective on the topic, while the first sentence provides a more detailed and specific picture of the status of arts and crafts in the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, wash and condition it with something designed to create volume. If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, do not wash it before curling. Simply apply a dry shampoo to your roots. If your hair usually has trouble holding a curl, skip washing it for a day or two before curling. This should help make your hair more malleable. Using less conditioner, or none at all, may also help. Again, this will be different for different hair types. If your hair is damaged, oily, or limp, spray it with a heat protectant from root to ends while it is still damp. Apply a strong-hold mousse liberally—you can do this at the roots to achieve a fuller look, or from mid-shaft to ends for a looser one. Blow dry upside-down until your hair is totally dry. If your hair is thick or not particularly oily, spray it from roots to ends with heat protectant, and work a liberal amount of strong-hold mousse through your whole head. You may not be able to afford lots of specialized hair products, especially if you don't curl your hair often, or you may be curling your hair on short notice and not have time to run out to the store. These recommended products will help your hair keep its curl and protect it from heat damage, but you can still achieve a beautiful curl without them. That said, it is highly recommended that at a minimum you have hair spray, and something to help protect your hair from heat (especially if you plan on curling it regularly). There are many shampoos that help with the latter, in addition to all the heat protectant sprays on the market.","completion":"This article discusses various approaches to curling hair based on different hair types.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Condemned to Live Context: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.","completion":"Professor Kristan confessed to the murders in the movie \\"Condemned to Live.\\" He was revealed to be the murderer after being seized by attacks that transformed him into a trance-like state of murderousness.

Question: Where did Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit originate from? Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.","completion":"Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit originated from the Rhineland to Riga to Romania."},{"prompt":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question.

It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon. Smaller, free and with loads of walks and picnic areas, I sent my intrepid husband ahead to brave the canyon bridge whilst I sipped a much-needed coffee in the local cafe. It was beautiful. It’s mostly because the thought of hopping onto a swaying bridge above the ravine gives me the heebie-jeebies, whereas he will stride across panels of transparent glass suspended metres above busy streets (like Tower Bridge) or gondola rides that skim well above the treetops (like Japan lake or the Bavarian Alpine range.)

But the best video I’ve seen so far features a Thunder fan in a Durant jersey with “traitor” taped over the name, standing outside the Thunder arena holding a “Golden State?! That’s FucKD” sign, getting yelled at by a woman who thinks that Durant put Oklahoma City on the map, and a grown-ass man is allowed to make whatever decision he wants. Happy Independence Day! Advertisement h/t Samantha Vicent ||||| Kevin Durant is joining the Golden State Warriors. Saying he has experienced \\"by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life,\\" Durant announced his decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday in a post on The Players' Tribune. Editor's Picks Durant taking the easy road? Not so fast Kevin Durant might be joining a talented Warriors squad, but there's risk involved in his decision, J.A. Adande writes. Fans burn Durant's jersey after he leaves OKC Thunder fans didn't take the news of Kevin Durant's leaving Oklahoma City to join the Warriors too well. Warriors the greatest team ever with Durant? How much better are the Warriors with KD? How long is their title window? Kevin Pelton projects the NBA's new superteam, updated for the additions of David West and Zaza Pachulia. 2 Related Durant is expected to sign a two-year, 54.3 million contract, sources told ESPN's Marc Stein. The deal will include a player option after the first year. \\"The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player -- as that has always steered me in the right direction,\\" Durant wrote. \\"But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. \\"With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors.\\" After Durant signs with Golden State, two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry will be the fourth-highest-paid player on the Warriors. Durant will be No. 1, followed by Klay Thompson (16.6 million), Draymond Green (15.3 million) and Curry (12.1 million), who can become a free agent after next season. Green told The Undefeated's Marc J. Spears in a text message that he was ecstatic the Warriors landed Durant. He tweeted to express his enthusiasm about his new teammate. Welcome to THE FAMILY @KDTrey5 let's just do what we are setting out to do!! #Blockoutthenoise — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) July 4, 2016 \\"I'm excited about the opportunity to add one of the best players in the world to our team and welcome him to our brotherhood!

Warriors' odds jump with Durant After Kevin Durant's announcement that he will join Golden State, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has moved the Warriors' odds to win next season's title from 3-2 to 4-5, making them an overwhelming favorite. The Thunder's odds dropped from 8-1 to 30-1 at the Westgate. The SuperBook also opened the Warriors' season win total for the 2016-17 campaign at 68.5. Best odds to win 2016-17 NBA championship Team Current Opened Warriors 4-5 3-2 Cavaliers 3-1 5-2 Spurs 8-1 6-1 Clippers 20-1 16-1 Celtics 20-1 20-1 Thunder 30-1 8-1 -- Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook Durant's contract can be finalized Thursday, when the leaguewide moratorium on signings and trades is lifted. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was in Hawaii and said he learned about Durant's decision to join Golden State via The Players' Tribune, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported. The Warriors plan to renounce their rights to Harrison Barnes, sources told Stein, to help clear the salary-cap space needed to sign Durant. That will make Barnes an unrestricted free agent on Thursday. Barnes, sources told Stein, remains on course to sign with the Dallas Mavericks, who reached a verbal agreement with the 24-year-old on a four-year max deal worth 94.4 million, no matter what happened with Durant. The Mavericks also have agreed to a trade with the Warriors to acquire center Andrew Bogut and his 2016-17 contract, with a base value of just over 11 million. Just before Durant's Players' Tribune post, Bogut removed references to the Warriors from his Twitter page. Golden State will renounce its rights to center Festus Ezeli, which will make him an unrestricted free agent, but guard Shaun Livingston was told by the Warriors that he won't be traded, sources told Spears. Golden State also agreed to a one-year, 2.9 million deal with Zaza Pachulia, according to a report by The Vertical. Thunder general manager Sam Presti expressed his team's disappointment over Durant's departure in a statement. \\"Kevin made an indelible mark on the Thunder organization and the state of Oklahoma as a founding father of this franchise,\\" Presti said. \\"We can't adequately articulate what he meant to the foundation of this franchise and our success. While clearly disappointing that he has chosen to move on, the core values that he helped establish only lead to us thanking him for the many tangible and intangible ways that he helped our program.\\" Presti later said the team had a pretty good idea that Durant was moving on even before its final meeting with him in the Hamptons on Sunday. \\"Even when we were relatively sure it probably wasn't going to go our way, eight staff members and our owner stayed overnight in New York just to be there and to kind of finish it out,\\" Presti said at a news conference in Oklahoma City on Monday evening. \\"We've been there for every first in his career, and we wanted to finish it out the right way by being present whenever that decision was made, regardless of how it turned out.\\" Presti said he was alerted to Durant's final choice in a phone call from Durant on Monday morning a few minutes before the announcement. \\"It was disappointing, it was hurtful; but at the end of the day, it was what he felt was best for him,\\" Presti said. The Thunder will take some time before making any roster decisions, particularly related to All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook's future, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst. The biggest catch on the free-agent market, Durant met with six teams over the past three days: Oklahoma City, Golden State, San Antonio, Boston, Miami and the Los Angeles Clippers. The Warriors held their meeting with Durant on Friday. On Saturday, Durant spoke with NBA legend Jerry West, a member of the Warriors' executive board, on the phone, sources told ESPN's Chris Broussard. West outlined the reasons he thought Golden State would be the ideal fit for the superstar forward. Kevin Durant is joining the Warriors after his Thunder took Golden State to the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals last season. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Durant, 27, has spent all nine seasons of his career with the Thunder organization. He won the MVP in 2014, has been named first-­team All-­NBA five times and has made seven All-­Star teams. He has appeared in four Western Conference finals and one NBA Finals, in which he lost in five games to the Heat in 2012. \\"I'm from Washington D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me,\\" Durant wrote. \\"It taught me so much about family, as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. \\"It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career.\\" Durant bounced back last season to earn second­-team All-NBA honors after undergoing three surgeries to repair a Jones fracture on his right foot suffered before the 2014-­15 season, in which he was limited to 27 games before undergoing a season-­ending bone graft procedure in March. Without Durant, the Thunder missed the postseason. With Durant back for 72 games last season, the Thunder improved to 55-27 and finished third in the West. The Thunder beat the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the opening round, upset the 67-­win Spurs in six games in the second round and pushed the Warriors to seven games in the Western Conference finals. Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists last season, and he scored at least 20 points in 67 straight games. In nine seasons, Durant has averaged 27.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. Golden State set an NBA regular-season record with 73 wins and led the league in scoring last season, but the Warriors fell just short of a repeat NBA title and lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. ESPN staff writer Royce Young and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| This has been by far the most challenging few weeks in my professional life. I understood cognitively that I was facing a crossroads in my evolution as a player and as a man, and that it came with exceptionally difficult choices. What I didn’t truly understand, however, was the range of emotions I would feel during this process. The primary mandate I had for myself in making this decision was to have it based on the potential for my growth as a player — as that has always steered me in the right direction. But I am also at a point in my life where it is of equal importance to find an opportunity that encourages my evolution as a man: moving out of my comfort zone to a new city and community which offers the greatest potential for my contribution and personal growth. With this in mind, I have decided that I am going to join the Golden State Warriors. I’m from Washington, D.C. originally, but Oklahoma City truly raised me. It taught me so much about family as well as what it means to be a man. There are no words to express what the organization and the community mean to me, and what they will represent in my life and in my heart forever. The memories and friendships are something that go far beyond the game. Those invaluable relationships are what made this deliberation so challenging. It really pains me to know that I will disappoint so many people with this choice, but I believe I am doing what I feel is the right thing at this point in my life and my playing career. I will miss Oklahoma City, and the role I have had in building this remarkable team. I will forever cherish the relationships within the organization — the friends and teammates that I went to war with on the court for nine years, and all the fans and people of the community. They have always had my back unconditionally, and I cannot be more grateful for what they have meant to my family and to me. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick examines Durant's decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder to join Golden State. usa today sports Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (30, right) is congratulated by Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant (35) after Game 7 of the Western conference finals. Durant has decided if he can't beat the Warriors, to join them. (Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) The balance of power in the NBA remained in the Western Conference with Kevin Durant’s stunning decision to play for the Golden State Warriors. But within the West, the scale has swung – almost impossibly so for a 73-win team with three All-Stars – even more in the Warriors’ favor for the 2016-17 season and beyond. By adding Durant, one of the league’s best players and former MVP, to a roster with two-time MVP Steph Curry and All-NBA players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, the Warriors are heavy favorites to win the championship next year after losing a dramatic seven-game Finals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers in June. While some teams improved in the East, not one has improved enough to surpass the Cavs as the favorites to win the conference title season. There is a strong possibility the Warriors and Cavs will play in the Finals for a third consecutive time – something no two teams have done, not even the Boston Celtics-Los Angeles Lakers of the 1960s and 1980s. San Antonio, which finished with a franchise-best 67 victories last season, fell further behind the Warriors with Durant’s decision. Oklahoma City, which had a 3-1 lead on Golden State in the conference finals in May, just lost its star, and now has to ponder a long-term plan that might not include Russell Westbrook, who is a free agent next summer. The Los Angeles Clippers maintained the status quo. The Warriors can dominate in the West. It’s a dynasty in the making. That doesn’t mean they will try to break their record of 73 regular-season victories. In fact, expect Golden State to take a more deliberate approach to the regular season, pacing itself for the two-month playoff run. Now, the Warriors have work to do on the court. Incorporating four All-Stars into the lineup won’t be easy, especially on the offensive end. But that’s why Warriors coach Steve Kerr – as he has said before – is paid so well. It’s up to him and his coaching staff to get buy-in from those stars to play a certain way, to sacrifice for the good of the team. But on the surface, that roster creates so many problems for opposing defenses. Don’t think for a second Durant’s decision to leave small-market Oklahoma City for big-market Golden State sits well with the rest of the league. The 2011 lockout, in part, sought to create better opportunities for small-market teams to compete. The league instituted tougher restrictions in the collective bargaining agreement, including harsher financial penalties for team spending above the luxury tax line. As recently as June 2 just before Game 1 of the Finals, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “Creating a system that allows every team I’d say the equality — an equal opportunity to compete for championships. I think we’re never going to have NFL-style parity in this league. It is the nature of this league that certain players are so good that those teams are likely almost automatically if that player remains healthy to become playoff teams and especially mixed with other great players.” But the influx of TV money gave teams that otherwise would not have had the financial flexibility to add a maximum-salary player the freedom to do just that. Remember all that angst in 2010 about creating super teams after LeBron James joined the Miami Heat alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh? Well, the Warriors just created the super team of all super teams in this era of the NBA. Thunder general manager Sam Presti can’t be happy about the league’s inability to prevent a move like this from happening. Silver knew the unprecedented rise in the salary cap, from 70 million in 2015-16 to 94 million in 2016-17, would create unintended circumstances. At the 2016 All-Star Game Silver said, \\"As I’ve said before, a dramatic increase in the cap, as we’re going to see next year, is not something we modeled when we designed this collective bargaining agreement. We'd prefer a system where teams are managing for cap room, and we'd prefer a system in which stars are distributed throughout the league as opposed to congregating in one market.\\" Five years ago, NBA owners and front-office executives were not envisioning a scenario in which a team with three All-Stars could add a fourth. But that’s what just happened, and 29 other teams, including the champion Cavs, are wondering how they’re going to beat Golden State in a seven-game series. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A famous basketball player named Kevin Durant has decided to join a team called the Golden State Warriors, leaving his old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder. This is a big deal because Kevin Durant is really good at basketball, and now the Golden State Warriors have a lot of top players on their team, making them the favorites to win the championship next year.

Morgan/Getty Images and KOJI SASAHARA/AP After a very eventful couple of weeks, the 2016 Rio Olympics came to a close on Sunday, leaving us with an epic teaser for what's in store at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made his legendary entrance into the Rio Games through a green pipe dressed as Mario and the world collectively lost its mind. After seeing Mario — a Japanese video game icon — joined by Pac-Man and other anime characters in Brazil's Maracana stadium, we started to imagine all the wondrous potential of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. With five new sports — skateboarding, karate, surfing, sports climbing and baseball/softball — coming to the Games in 2020, we have a feeling this could be one of the most exciting Olympics yet. Here are nine awesome things from Tokyo we hope to see in the 2020 Olympics: Robots could be taking over the 2020 Olympics, as Japan has plans to build a \\"robot village\\" near the Olympic Village. The area already contains a 60-foot Gundam statue and the Japanese government is working to create self-driving taxis in addition to robots which will help visitors carry their luggage and find their seats in the stadium. Image: YANN BOHAC/SIPA via ap photo Who better than Shigeru Miyamoto — Nintendo's Japanese video game designer famous for creating games like Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda — to show up alongside the prime minister dressed as Mario. We'd love to see Miyamoto dressed as Link, Luigi, Wario or perhaps even Bowser. However he chooses to present himself, we're hoping he's a key part of the 2020 Olympics. In 1988, Akira — a Japanese anime about biker gangs set in a post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo — essentially predicted Tokyo winning the 2020 Olympic bid, so it seems only right that they play some part in the Opening Ceremony. I hope that the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Olympics is just a recreation of the opening for Akira. — Ricardo López Ortiz (@RLopezOrtiz) August 22, 2016 tokyo needs to light the torch by firing a laser from a motorcyclejust to reference akira's 2020 tokyo olympics — El H.D.H. (@El_HDH) August 10, 2016 The sacred Olympic flame can surely be trusted to stay lit in the care of Godzilla — a famous Japanese character in the form of a giant, fire-breathing monster. There's literally a game called \\"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games,\\" so when Shinzo Abe appeared as Mario, he left many fans wondering where exactly Sonic was. Hopefully Tokyo will take advantage of this beautiful opportunity and give Sonic the attention he deserves. If you think the real 2020 Olympics are gonna be cool wait till you see Mario and Sonic at the Tokyo games. — Stingos (@Stingos_) August 22, 2016 I'm just sayingMario and Sonic at Tokyo 2020SEGA, you have the Miku licenseI'M JUST SAYIN' — Tracker (@Tracker_TD) August 22, 2016 If Tokyo 2020 isn't just a huge recreation of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, I'm going to be thoroughly disappointed — becca (@_littletimelord) August 22, 2016 Can Mario please be the icon of the 2020 Olympics? And then Mario's face is literally the logo of Mario and Sonic 2020 games — Samuel Thornbury (@AnimatedCritic) August 22, 2016 According to CNN, Nintendo's stock rose 3.5% in Tokyo after Shinzo Abe's cameo as Mario, so we have a feeling more iconic characters will definitely be making cameos. With the recent popularity of Pokémon GO, people have once again become obsessed with the Japanese cartoon characters. Though Pokémon GO is unfortunately not an Olympic sport, hopefully the 2020 Olympics will find some way to bring Pokémon to life and incorporate them into the opening ceremony. Hello Kitty and other classic Sanrio characters are an important (and adorable) part of Japanese pop culture that will unite people of all age groups, and lets face it, make the Olympics so much cuter. Come on. How great would an Opening Ceremony be with some karaoke? The Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony will somehow include karaoke with copious amounts of sake and it will be incredible. — Taylor Nichols (@taylornichols) August 22, 2016 Before the whole robbery scandal of Rio 2016, Ryan Lochte graced us with this Instagram photo of him and Michael Phelps carbo-loading with some spaghetti before their 200-meter individual medley.

Background: Andre Nolan Dawson (born July 10, 1954), nicknamed \\"The Hawk\\" and \\"Awesome Dawson\\", is a former American professional baseball player. During a 21-year baseball career, he played for four different teams as a center and right fielder, spending most of his career with the Montreal Expos (1976-1986) and Chicago Cubs (1987-1992). An 8-time National League (NL) All-Star, he was named the league's Rookie of the Year in 1977 after batting .282 with 19 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI), and won the Most Valuable Player Award in 1987 after leading the league with 49 homers and 137 RBI; he had been runner-up for the award in both 1981 and 1983. Context: Dawson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010, his ninth year of eligibility, rising from an initial vote total of 45.3% in 2002 to 77.9% in 2010. Dawson's Hall of Fame plaque depicts him with a Montreal Expos cap. The major impediments to Dawson's election to the Hall of Fame had been his ordinary career .323 on-base percentage, his statistics being diminished in stature by sluggers who played after him in the steroid era, and never playing in a World Series. Cubs teammate Ryne Sandberg campaigned for Dawson's induction during his speech at his own Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2005: \\"No player in baseball history worked harder, suffered more or did it better than Andre Dawson. He's the best I've ever seen. I watched him win an MVP for a last-place team in 1987 [with the Cubs], and it was the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in baseball. He did it the right way, the natural way, and he did it in the field and on the bases and in every way, and I hope he will stand up here someday.\\" Andre Dawson was the second player in the Hall of Fame whose plaque depicts him with an Expos logo, after Gary Carter. Although Dawson had played the majority of his 21-year career with Montreal, he publicly expressed his disappointment with the decision, saying it was \\"a little gut-wrenching\\" to find out he would not go in as a Chicago Cub. Dawson's reluctance to be enshrined as an Expo stemmed, in part, from the breakdown of his relationship with the team during MLB's collusion scandal of 1986-87, when he claims the team not only \\"threw him out\\" of Montreal, but tried to prevent other teams from signing him as a free agent. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987. The Hall noted that \\"Dawson had 1,575 of his 2,774 hits as an Expo, won six of his eight Gold Glove awards in Montreal and led the Expos to their only postseason series win\\". Question: did he have any other stats?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Andre Dawson had many other impressive stats throughout his career. Some of them include: 1. 2,774 career hits - This places Dawson 54th on the all-time MLB career hits list. 2. 438 career home runs - Dawson ranks 45th on the all-time MLB career home runs list. 3. 1,591 career runs batted in (RBI) - Dawson sits at 41st on the all-time MLB career RBI list. 4. 314 career stolen bases - This demonstrates Dawson's speed and ability on the basepaths. 5. 8 Gold Glove Awards - This honors Dawson's exceptional defensive skills as an outfielder. 6. 4 Silver Slugger Awards - These awards highlight Dawson's prowess as an offensive player. In summary, Andre Dawson had numerous other notable stats throughout his baseball career, which contributed to his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame. His achievements showcase his talent both offensively and defensively, making him one of the most well-rounded players in baseball history."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Tibet is ranked the lowest among China’s 31 provinces on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data. In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities. Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures.

The rich culture, history, and spiritual nature of Tibetan Buddhism have attracted many tourists from around the world, seeking to explore and understand the unique way of life practiced by the Tibetan people.

With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end. BUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental. I just want to bust out a red pen and edit the post.

Choices: - alone - story book - herb garden - great outdoors - sky The rationale to choose \\"great outdoors\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","completion":"Great outdoors The rationale to choose \\"great outdoors\\" as the answer is based on the following points: 1. Natural habitat: Bees are naturally found in the great outdoors, where they can access a wide variety of flowers and plants for collecting nectar and pollen. They thrive in diverse ecosystems such as forests, meadows, gardens, and even urban environments with green spaces. 2. Role in the ecosystem: Bees are crucial pollinators in the great outdoors, playing a significant role in the reproduction of many plant species. By transferring pollen from one plant to another, they facilitate the development of fruits, seeds, and new plant life. 3. Colony lifestyle: Bees are social insects that typically live in colonies with a complex social structure. They work together to build nests, usually located in the great outdoors in areas like tree hollows, crevices, or other protected spaces. The hive consists of a queen bee, male drones, and thousands of female worker bees. Now, let's address the other options to clarify why they are not suitable answers: - Alone: While bees may sometimes be seen foraging individually, they are generally part of a colony and rely on the collective efforts of their nest-mates. Therefore, being \\"alone\\" does not accurately reflect their natural habitat. - Storybook: Bees may be portrayed in storybooks; however, this option doesn't represent their real-life habitat. Bees are living creatures found in nature, not in fictitious places within literature. - Herb garden: Although bees can be found in herb gardens due to the flowers providing a good source of nectar and pollen, this answer is too specific and doesn't encompass the greater variety of outdoor environments where bees are naturally found. - Sky: Bees may be seen flying in the sky while foraging or looking for a new nesting site, but the sky itself is not their natural habitat. Bees require solid ground or structures to build their nests and spend a significant amount of time on flowers collecting nectar and pollen. In summary, the best answer is \\"great outdoors\\" because it accurately and comprehensively describes the natural habitat where bees are found and their role in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The primary function of a period, or full stop, is to denote the end of a sentence or declarative statement. Therefore, choosing \\"end of line\\" captures the essential purpose of a period in written language. To better understand why \\"end of line\\" is the most suitable answer, let us examine the other options: 1. History: While periods have undoubtedly been used throughout the history of written language, this option does not accurately explain why a period is likely to be on a page. The historical existence of periods is not the primary reason why they are used on a page. 2. Tracking of music: This option is not germane to the question at hand, as it refers to a completely different context. Periods are not commonly used as a method to track or notate music; instead, measures, barlines, and other musical symbols are employed for this purpose. Thus, this choice does not explain why a human would find a period on a page. 3. School: While it is true that students learn about periods and their usage in school, the educational setting does not sufficiently explain why a period is likely to appear on a written page. Education is merely the process through which humans come to understand the purpose and application of periods — rather than being an inherent feature of written language. 4. Finish sentence: This option is the closest in meaning to \\"end of line.\\" However, \\"up_finish sentence\\" is not as precise as \\"end of line,\\" which more clearly conveys the idea that a period signifies the completion of a sentence or statement. Furthermore, \\"finish sentence\\" might also be interpreted as a directive to complete a partially written sentence, whereas \\"end of line\\" unambiguously identifies the role of the period on a page. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"end of line\\" as the answer to the question because it concisely and accurately represents the primary function of a period on a page — to mark the end of a sentence or declarative statement. The alternative options either do not address the purpose of periods or are insufficiently related to the context of the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She threw herself forwards.","completion":"Although the verb \\"throw\\" has similar physical connotations in the two sentences, the meanings are not exactly the same. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the differences and nuances. 1. The horse threw its rider. In this sentence, \\"throw\\" implies that the horse forcefully or suddenly expelled or removed its rider, causing them to fall or lose their balance. This could be due to the horse bucking, rearing, or displaying other similar behavior that would cause the rider to lose their grip or seat. Here, the action of \\"throwing\\" refers to the horse creating a sudden and often involuntary movement aimed at removing the rider from its back. 2. She threw herself forwards. In this case, \\"throw\\" is used to describe the forceful or enthusiastic movement of a person, specifically in a forward motion. The subject (she) most likely jumped, lunged, or moved with great intention and energy. Here, the verb \\"throw\\" is used metaphorically to emphasize the intensity of the action, but it does not involve expelling or removing something from oneself. The focus in this sentence is on the manner in which the action is carried out, highlighting the enthusiasm, energy, or urgency behind the movement. To conclude, while the verb \\"throw\\" brings up images of forceful or sudden movements in both sentences, the meanings are not identical in the given context. In the first sentence, \\"throw\\" refers to the action of removing or expelling something (e.g., the rider) due to an external force (e.g., the horse); in the second sentence, it's a metaphor for the intensity and manner of a voluntary movement of a person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: The black-footed ferret, North America's rarest mammal, is returning to the western prairie 35 years after being declared extinct. The comeback trail for Mustela nigripes began in 1981, when a ranch dog with a dead ferret in its mouth led to the rediscovery of a remnant population near Meeteetse in northwestern Wyoming. (See stunning pictures of the rarest animals on Earth.) The last 18 survivors of that population formed the seed stock for a captive-breeding program that reintroduced the species to its former range at 25 sites from southernmost Canada to northern Mexico. Yet numbers in the wild remain low—fewer than 500, according to Peter Gober, recovery coordinator at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center in Carr, Colorado. A major hurdle is disease, particularly sylvatic plague, a flea-borne infection that appeared in North America in the early 1900s. Because the disease is non-native, the black-footed ferret—a member of the weasel family—has no natural resistance; neither does its prey, the prairie dog. (Related: [Video] \\"Why Do Prairie Dogs Do 'The Wave'?\\") Prairie dogs are \\"pretty much all the ferrets eat,\\" Gober says. They also \\"provide shelter, because the ferrets make use of their burrows. \\"There are quite a few prairie dogs in the West still, despite the fact that they've been reduced by 90 percent plus since historical times,\\" he adds. \\"The problem is that they fluctuate wildly, due to drought and because of this plague.\\" The reintroduced ferret populations mirror these fluctuations. They \\"come and go\\" like \\"lights blinking on a Christmas tree,\\" Gober says. (Read about how scientists decide what species to save.) Repopulating ferrets over a wide range of their old territory helps manage the risk of disease, but that requires access to suitable land with plenty of prairie dogs. \\"There's a lot of raw habitat out there, but it's degraded,\\" Gober says. Such habitat is typically found on livestock ranches, where historically prairie dogs haven't been welcome. Because they compete with cattle for grass, millions were exterminated during the past century. Wealthy landowners like media mogul Ted Turner are already on board with the program, but accommodating the ferrets' increasing need for habitat will require financial support for the ranching community in return for tolerating significant numbers of prairie dogs. The Natural Resources Conservation Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, so far has provided about a million dollars to a dozen landowners in Colorado, and hopes to expand the program to other states. New hope also comes in the form of a recently developed vaccine to combat sylvatic plague. Meanwhile, Gober and his colleagues in Colorado are breeding some 250 black-footed ferrets annually. ||||| Rancher Gary Walker squats in his cowboy boots and jeans and rests a small animal carrier against a black-tailed prairie dog hole before swinging the door open. He's careful to keep his hands out of the way. \\"These are little vicious guys, too,\\" Walker says, with a laugh. \\"I just love 'em.\\" The black-footed ferret inside is timid at first, and buries herself in the shredded paper of her enclosure. But with a little coaxing, she bounds into the hole, than peeps her head out to stare across 65,000 acres of flat, short-grass prairie that will be her new home. Her pink snout twitches. Her eyes blink behind a Zorro-like mask of black fur. If all goes well, this little girl and her buddies will live to be 3 or 4 years old here on Walker's Turkey Creek Ranch, located between Fort Carson and Pueblo West. They'll live in prairie dog holes, emerging mostly at night, when they'll search from burrow to burrow until they find a sleeping prairie dog, which they'll bite on the neck and asphyxiate with their slinky bodies. A ferret can live on a prairie dog corpse for about three days before killing again. She and the 18 others being released today could produce as many as four litters, usually of three to four kits, but sometimes as few as one or as many as 10. Less than a year after they're born, the young males will begin mostly solitary lives. The females hopefully will grow up and have families of their own. But there's plenty of things that could cut these ferrets' lives short. Luckily, since Gary Walker and his wife Georgia have agreed to allow the ferrets and prairie dogs to live on their land (and have already set aside over 21,888 acres as a conservation easement that will never be developed), they won't be poisoned or otherwise killed. \\"Before we're through, we hope that from Penrose to Piñon and across the Arkansas River, our holdings, the Walker Ranch holdings, will never be part of a development,\\" Gary Walker says. \\"These will be open spaces forever, where the ferrets can roam free.\\" Prairie dogs, which live throughout the Great Plains, as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico, have often been targeted by ranchers who say they compete too heavily with cattle for grass, or by farmers who see them as pests. They now cover less than 2 percent of their former territory. And as the prairie dogs have disappeared, so have the ferrets, which in a natural setting help keep prairie dog populations in check. A huge part of the problem for both has been Sylvatic plague, which was brought from overseas ages ago, and canine distemper. Both diseases spread quickly and are fatal. Ferrets can also fall prey to any number of predators. \\"They have a tough, short little life,\\" says John Hughes, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. But for the black-footed ferret, the only American species of ferret, which was nearly extinct not so long ago, any kind of life is a gift. And it's only through a massive effort involving federal and state agencies, nonprofits, tribes and landowners that they're finally making a comeback. The black-footed ferret has been thought extinct twice. They were assumed gone in the late 1950s, but in 1964 a small population was found in Mellette County, S.D. Scientists attempted to breed some of them in captivity but were unsuccessful. The last one died in 1979. Then, in 1981, a ranch dog dragged a strange-looking creature home near Meeteetse, Wyo. The rancher brought it to a taxidermist, who identified it and called government officials. The population that was found peaked to 129 ferrets in 1984, but it was hit hard by disease. Between 1985 and 1987, 24 were captured, 18 of whom survived. Seven bred. And from that, we now have hundreds of ferrets, both in the wild and in captivity. Della Garelle, a veterinarian and director of field conservation at Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, estimates that there might be around 800 of them alive. The zoo, which is one of five breeding sites in the country, has 28. It's been a breeding site since 1990, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It also breeds other endangered species. Visitors don't usually see any of those animals. Garelle works with the other breeding sites, trading ferrets to maintain a carefully tracked balance of the genes of the original seven breeding ferrets. Many end up in Wellington, Colo., at the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center. Hughes, the wildlife biologist, is one of the center staff that helps the ferrets at the facility, which he says is \\"basically a walled-in prairie dog town.\\" There, kits learn to hunt prairie dogs. The successful ones are considered for re-entry into the wild. They're only released in areas where they'll be relatively safe, and where there is a healthy prairie dog community that covers at least 2,000 acres. Even then, it's risky. Reintroduced populations are still wiped out by disease at times. While captive ferrets can be inoculated, their kits are harder to protect. Scientists travel to some of the wild places where they're released, to try and capture and inoculate new generations, but it's difficult work. Areas where ferrets live are also often dusted with pesticides to cut back on insects that can be vectors for disease. Scientists are currently working on an oral plague inoculation that could be baited to prairie dogs, hopefully creating \\"herd immunity.\\" \\"We could recover the species,\\" Hughes says, \\"without plague.\\" Prairie dogs are what is known as a \\"keystone species\\" — one with a disproportionate effect on its environment. That's because the holes they create help water reach plant roots in the arid West and provide homes for other animals, like the ferret, burrowing owls and swift fox. They're also prey for many species. But getting ranchers to stop killing prairie dogs has been difficult, and the release of ferrets wasn't even widely allowed in the state until the passage of 2013's Colorado Senate Bill 169, which allowed their release on private land with a landowner's consent, so long as the owners had signed on to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services' Safe Harbor Agreement. Safe Harbor offers incentives to landowners who agree to allow the government to manage an endangered species on their land. Landowners can't purposely kill the animals, but the program protects them if they accidentally kill animals in the general use of their land. The Walkers were considered trailblazers for allowing ferrets on their land, and dozens have been released there this year and last year. Several other property owners in the state have since allowed the ferrets on their land, and some public lands are also seeing ferrets introduced since the passage of 2014's Colorado House Bill 1267, which allowed for that. Tom Warren, the retired environmental program director for the Department of the Army at Fort Carson who has worked for years to bring back the ferret, says the key to recovering the species will be ongoing cooperation between experts and the environmental stewardship of ranchers. \\"It was golden opportunity,\\" he says of slow recovery of the ferrets, \\"that basically came to pass because a whole lot of us were dedicated to it and made it happen.\\" |||||","completion":"The black-footed ferret, North America's rarest mammal was thought to be extinct 35 years ago but has been brought back to the wild after a breeding program. A small population of just 18 was discovered in 1981, after being thought extinct and was used as the base for a captive-breeding program. Today, there are still fewer than 500 in the wild across 25 sites from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Prairie dogs, their main food source, have lost natural resistance to the sylvatic plague which has caused their numbers to drop significantly.

My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, \\"A girl!\\" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago. Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life. More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree. Do they ever wonder if we exist? Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple. Fed three square meals a day, I grew like a wild weed and grasped all the opportunities they had to offer--books, music, education, church life and community activities.

It's correct to call it a list because it is a selection of numbers presented within brackets and separated by a comma. Part #2: You need to find the average of each two consecutive values. Usage: Here, the two numbers are 44 and -91. To find the average of these two consecutive numbers, you calculate: (44 + (-91)) /2. Part #3: The average of two numbers a and b is calculated as: (a + b) /2. Usage: Using this calculation on our sample (44, -91), it generalizes as (a + b) /2, where 'a' is 44 and 'b' is -91. This simplifies to (44 + -91) /2 = -47 /2 = -23.5. So, the average of 44 and -91 is -23.5. Part #4: The output should be a list of the averages of each two consecutive values. Usage: Since we have only two numbers or one pair, the output would be [-23.5]. If we had more number pairs, we'd continue calculating the average for each pair and listing all the averages in the same format. For instance, if we had [5,10,15], we'd calculate the averages for (5,10) and (10,15), and the result would be [7.5, 12.5]."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin. But I can use this background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D .

Restoration of the elaborate decor of the interior had to be fully redone. In the courtyard, the restorers placed an artificial lake, fountains, and a miniature garden—all of which had been in Horodecki's original plans.The building was opened as a filial \\"Masterpieces of Ukrainian Art\\" of the National Museum of Arts in November 2004. It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors.

Question: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

While Facebook has had a history of privacy and trust issues, the election meddling scandals in the United States and Britain came to light more prominently during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum in the UK. This time period revealed the extent of Facebook's involvement in spreading fake news and its misuse of users' data, such as the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal that surfaced in March 2018.

Question: The answer to the question: At what number did the album that did not include the man who got rights to The Wall chart in the UK and US? is inside the article: In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with..., can you guess it ?

In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time. \\"I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,\\" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline. Though a graduate student struggling to finish her dissertation , Sarich chose to be her dad's full-time caregiver. \\"It's only now, several years later, that I'm realizing how much work it was. It's the kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't cure,\\" she said. About 6 million Americans provide care to elderly relatives or friends living outside of nursing homes. Laurel Kennedy, author of \\"The Daughter Trap\\" (Thomas Dunne Books, 25.95), says that women bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- about 70 percent of hands-on care giving such as bathing. \\"I want to be clear: Women don't hate this,\\" Kennedy said. \\"What they hate is that everyone just assumes they'll do it.\\" Kennedy is calling for _ equal to the rise of affordable child care and day care: Employers should help working caregivers by offering accommodations.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the song that was Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King's favorite? The album was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona.

Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without.

Article: Lettuce has been eaten for over 4,500 years, and was known to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden.

M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China.

(CNN) -- The attorney representing the U.S. soldier suspected in the Afghanistan massacre of 16 villagers, including nine children, is a flamboyant, pugnacious trial lawyer who doesn't shy from the hardest of hard-core cases. As commanding in physical stature as he is in the courtroom, the 6 1/2-foot-tall John Henry Browne has defended serial killer Ted Bundy, who confessed to more than 30 murders before he was executed in Florida in 1989. The Seattle attorney also defended Benjamin Ng, convicted for his 1983 role in 13 murders in the Wah Mee massacre, described then as Washington state's worst mass killing. In the villages, a U.S. soldier opened fire, killing nine children, three women and four men, witnesses and","completion":"Afghan officials said, in a horrific act that sparked widespread outrage and intensified calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the war-torn nation, further complicating an already delicate relationship between the United States and Afghanistan. Locals were left in shock and mourning, struggling to come to terms with the brutality of the massacre, as questions surrounding the soldier's motives and mental state began to mount on a global stage. Despite the deeply troubling nature of these cases, Browne has a track record of taking on clients that most lawyers would hesitate to represent, driven by a belief in the importance of a fair legal defense for even the most despised individuals. With his imposing presence and tenacious demeanor, Browne has earned a reputation as an unflappable, highly skilled attorney who is not afraid to tackle complex, high-stakes cases, often employing an aggressive style of advocacy that is both polarizing and effective. Browne's defense strategies often center around exploring the human side of his clients, delving into their backgrounds, experiences, and psychological profiles in an effort to present a more nuanced understanding of the terrible acts they are accused of committing. While this approach can sometimes engender sympathy from jurors, who may come to see the accused as a product of their circumstances rather than as pure evil, it can also risk alienating those who view it as an attempt to excuse the inexcusable. As the investigation into the Afghanistan massacre unfolds, it is likely that Browne will face an uphill battle in defending his client, battling not just the weight of the evidence and the sheer horror of the crime but also the widespread public animosity towards the suspect and the larger political implications of the case. Ultimately, however, his willingness to stand beside those accused of the most heinous deeds is a testament to his commitment to the principles of due process and the fundamental right to a fair trial -- rights that form the bedrock of a just society.

Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women's basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard's mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day. Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. Howard led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard's rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten \\"All things through Christ Phil: 4:13\\", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard's leaping reach of 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) is the highest documented in NBA history, 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than Shaquille O'Neal's previous record of 12 ft 5 in (3.78 m). As of April 2013, Howard's career average of 12.9 rebounds per game (in the regular season) ranked 12th in NBA history. Howard's abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: \\"[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking.\\" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: \\"[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence.\\" Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: \\"It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're going to have to change the rules.\\" As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA. While many sports pundits have been rating Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA since 2006, Howard has some weaknesses in his game. Offensively, his shooting range remains limited; he is also mistake-prone, having led the NBA in total number of turnovers in the 2006-07 season. Like many centers, he has a low free throw conversion percentage. As a result, he is often a target of the Hack-a-Shaq defense and is annually among the league leaders in free throw attempts. During the 2007-08 regular season, Howard led the NBA with 897 free throw attempts while shooting only 59% from the free throw line. Also in that season, outside of layups and dunks, his shooting percentage was only 31.6%. In the 2008-09 season, he led the NBA again with 849 free throw attempts and in 2009-10, he was second in the NBA with 816.

So, (2421 - 2790)*s + 328070 = 5821*s. Step 2: Calculate the combined coefficient. 2421 - 2790 = -369 So, our equation becomes -369*s + 328070 = 5821*s. Step 3: Move the term with s to the right side of the equation to isolate s. To do this, add 369*s to both sides of the equation: -369*s + 369*s + 328070 = 5821*s + 369*s This simplifies to: 328070 = 6190*s Step 4: Solve for s.

The owners of Germany's Die Zeit and Handelsblatt had claimed that AdBlock Plus's product was anti-competitive and threatened their ability to make money. But a court in Hamburg ruled that users do have the right to use the plug-in. The judgement has implications for other disputes involving the tool. \\"The Hamburg court decision is an important one because it sets a precedent that may help us avoid additional lawsuits and expenses defending what we feel is an obvious consumer right: giving people the ability to control their own screens by letting them block annoying ads and protect their privacy,\\" wrote AdBlock Plus's project manager, Ben Williams, on its blog. \\"Now that the legalities are out of the way, we want to reach out to other publishers and advertisers and content creators and encourage them to work with Adblock Plus rather than against us.\\" However, the publishers have indicated that they intend to fight on. \\"We are still convinced that AdBlock Plus is an illegal and anti-competitive practice,\\" they said in a joint statement. \\"It infringes the freedom of the press. Therefore, we will await the written reasons for the judgment, analyse them and examine the prospects of an appeals procedure.\\" AdBlock Plus - which is owned by the Cologne-based firm Eyeo - faces three separate but related cases involving the media groups, ProSiebenSat.1, RTL Interactive and Axel Springer. The recent court case had contested the legality of AdBlock Plus's software suppressing adverts from the pages of the Zeit Online, Handelsblatt and Wirtschafts Woche news sites. Their publishers had sought damages, but said their motivation was to challenge the software provider's wider business model. \\"We are, of course, questioning the offer [of] Adblock Plus in general,\\" Ebba Schroder, a spokeswoman for Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius told the BBC. While AdBlock Plus offers its web browser add-on to the public for free, it makes money by operating a \\"white list\\" of adverts that it allows to get through its filters. Such ads must meet certain criteria, for instance they must not include animations or sounds and cannot be pop-ups that cover other content. Website operators that want ads on their site added to the white list must seek permission. Although AdBlock Plus states that \\"no one can buy their way onto the white list\\", it does charge fees for what it terms \\"support services\\", the details of which are not made public. In February, the Financial Times reported that one unnamed media company had said it had been asked to pass on the equivalent of 30% of the extra revenues it would have made by having ads on its platform unblocked. That has led some critics to claim that the Eyeo is engaged in a \\"racket\\". But the firm insists that term is \\"imprecise and wrong\\". It highlights that its service has proved popular with many users, with AdBlock Plus having been downloaded nearly 400 million times. It also notes that it does not charge fees to smaller businesses and blogs, and allows users to block its white-listed ads if desired. \\"If we are racketeers we are terrible racketeers because 90% of the people on the white list don't pay anything and the criteria is the same for everyone,\\" Mr Williams told the BBC. \\"[The ruling] is living proof of the unalienable right of every user to enjoy online self-determination.\\" However, one lawyer, who is not involved in the German cases, noted that other European courts might not necessarily take the same view. \\"The Hamburg court based its decision on the provisions of EU Law... other national courts in EU member states must do likewise, but are not bound to reach the same legal conclusions,\\" said Paul Henty from the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. \\"There could also be different factual or economic circumstances in those jurisdictions which lead to a different result. \\"Nonetheless, the Hamburg judgment may be persuasive as an authority and will certainly be a boon to Eyeo in similar AdBlock disputes.\\"","completion":"A court in Hamburg ruled that users have the right to use AdBlock Plus, stating that it is a consumer right to block annoying ads and protect their privacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Assess the evidence given The evidence provided is that wind causes erosion. Step 3: Understand the process of erosion Erosion is the gradual removal of material from the surface of landforms due to natural processes like wind, water, or ice. In the case of wind, this process is called \\"wind erosion.\\" Wind erosion happens when small particles, such as sand or dust, are picked up by the wind and transported elsewhere, leading to the wear and breakdown of larger objects, like rocks and soil, over time. Step 4: Relate the evidence to the question Since wind erosion can take a large object and break it down into smaller particles over time, it is a potential culprit in this scenario. Step 5: Formulate the answer Given the evidence and understanding the process of erosion, the answer to the question is: \\"If a thing has been taken from a large object and made much smaller, even minuscule, and this was done over many years, the likely culprit was wind erosion.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Where is Camp Humphreys located?

The purple ball used the fear of everyone to become the leader that they all feared. The purple ball was mean to everyone. Until one day the red ball spoke up and got all the other colored balls together and they took the air from the purple ball and put it in the green ball. Sadly, the green ball had been without air for too long and was dead.

The balls could not say bad things because they were afraid of having their air taken away, just like what happened to the green ball.

Energy storage: Fat cells store energy in the form of lipids, which can be used by the body when needed during periods of fasting or when carbohydrates availability is low. 2. Insulation: Fat cells, particularly those around the body's core, act as insulators to help maintain body temperature and reduce heat loss. 3. Organ protection: Fats cells help protect internal organs from injury by acting as a cushion and shock absorber. 4. Hormone secretion: Fat cells secrete and regulate various hormones, such as leptin, which helps regulate appetite and energy balance; and adiponectin, which is involved in glucose regulation and fatty acid breakdown.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. Murray Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Poland and Russia, respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist. Murray attended Birch Wathen, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the \\"debasing and egalitarian public school system\\" he had previously attended in the Bronx. Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a \\"right-winger\\" (adherent of the \\"Old Right\\") among friends and neighbors who were \\"communists or fellow-travelers.\\" Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property, and \\"a determination to rise by one's own merits\\". \\"[A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent.\\" He attended Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time. During the 1940s Rothbard became acquainted with Frank Chodorov and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken and others, as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School, Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, Human Action. Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote various \\"right-wing\\" ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain Human Action in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a \\"senior analyst.\\" As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book Man, Economy, and State, published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively. Where did Rothbard go to school?","completion":"Murray Rothbard went to several schools during his educational journey.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. I am facing a new situation today: Beijing recently opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. In Montreal, there have been large reductions in sulfur oxides produced by manufacturing plants after a recent referendum.

This will lead to a decrease in the formation of acid rain in the area, thus reducing the potential harm to aquatic life in Montreal's freshwater habitats. On the other hand, Beijing has opened several new coal-fired power plants over the last few months. Coal-fired power plants release sulfur oxides, which contribute to the formation of acid rain. As a result, there is an increased risk for aquatic life in Beijing's freshwater habitats due to the potential formation and impact of acid rain. In summary, the aquatic life in the freshwater habitats of Montreal is less at risk of dying compared to Beijing, due to reductions in sulfur oxide production and the consequent decrease in potential acid rain formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Midnight Meat Train Movie plot: The film opens with a bald man with a briefcase sitting in a moving subway car. As the lights flicker he hears a noise, causing him to stand up. As he walks towards the source of the sound, the next subway car, he slips and falls in a large pool of blood. He then peers through the window to the next car and sees a figure chopping up a bloody corpse. Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a vegan amateur photographer who wants to find unique spots of the L.A. cityscape to shoot and, at the advice of his contractor Susan (Brooke Shields), heads into the city's subway system at night. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones), whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years. Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him and, instead, cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb), who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest. A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis (Roger Bart) begin to examine the photos Leon has been taking of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment. After breaking into the butcher's home, Jurgis is captured, and brutally killed. Maya goes to the police, but finds that they are as unwilling... My question: What is Leon's diet?

By Barbara Starr An Iranian fighter jet targeted an unarmed U.S. Predator drone over the Persian Gulf this week, the Pentagon says. It was the latest Iranian move aimed at thwarting American military airborne intelligence efforts in the region. Defense Department spokesman George Little said on Thursday the unmanned MQ-1 drone was conducting routine classified surveillance over international waters on Tuesday when approached by an Iranian F-4. The two aircraft came within 16 miles of each other. The American drone was escorted by two U.S. military aircraft, which remained over international waters, Little said, adding that the Iranian jet departed after a verbal warning. No shots were fired. However, Obama administration officials told CNN that the United States is concerned with Iranian intentions in incidents like this and whether such episodes could unintentionally trigger hostilities. In December 2011, a highly sensitive U.S. Sentinel drone gathering intelligence on Iran's nuclear program for the CIA was captured by Iran after it crashed. In November, an Iranian warplane fired on a Predator over the Gulf. After the November incident, the United States told Tehran that it would continue surveillance flights over international waters \\"consistent with longstanding practice,\\" Little said. \\"We also communicated that we reserve the right to protect our military assets as well as our forces and will continue to do so going forward,\\" he said. The use of U.S. drones so close to Iran remains a highly sensitive issue for American military intelligence. The aircraft are capable of using sensors to gather information about Iranian military movements. ||||| WASHINGTON—A U.S. drone conducting surveillance was approached by an Iranian fighter jet earlier this week, only to be warned off by American aircraft providing a security escort, Pentagon officials said Thursday. When the American fighter planes escorting the drone approached the Iranian plane, it broke off its pursuit of the drone, Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said. The Iranian plane never got closer than 16 miles from the drone, the Pentagon said. However, when the U.S. fighters spotted the Iranian plane, they closed to within two miles of the approaching craft. U.S. officials wouldn't specify what kind of American planes were involved or precisely where the incident took place. Officials said earlier Thursday that one of the U.S. planes fired a flare to ward off the Iranian fighter, but later said no flare had been fired. The encounter came as the latest incident between the U.S. and Iran as tensions ratchet up. Last November a pair of Iranian fighter planes fired on a drone conducting surveillance of Iran, but missed. After that incident, Mr. Little said in his statement, the U.S. told Iran it would conduct surveillance flights in international airspace and that it would protect its assets. \\"The United States communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters consistent with long-standing practice and our commitment to the security of the region,\\" Mr. Little said.

Everything we say & do - including all written, verbal and \\"body language\\" - are signals. We must communicate and lead all day, every day. As an organization, and as part of our culture, we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will. We are going to take our share of bumps and bruises. We have some great businesses here....and we are fortunate. We have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially, and in a market where many companies have not been as successful. Most of our wounds are self - inflicted. We can and should do a better job. I believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas: Vision - define what we want this company to be in the next 3-5 years Value - as part of building the World's Leading Company, my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term, sustainable value. This is not about just creating value in the eyes of Wall Street - this is about creating real value, perhaps as defined by \\"after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital\\". Market cap will follow this type of economic value creation. We need to measure it and incent people this way. Teamwork - we are a leadership team. I don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business. I would like to discuss how we improve as a team. Many of our employees (at an average age of 33 years) have never been through: an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at Enron We need big time leadership now....from all who are around that table Clear Demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees, customers and shareholders People - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to Enron everyday. These people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short, medium and long term.

Pick from: [1]. a paper lined surface [2]. a steel lined one [3]. a wood lined one [4]. a cotton line surface","completion":"The most likely surface touched if a person gets a shock from a faulty system would be [2]. a steel-lined one. This is because metals, such as steel, are excellent conductors of electrical energy. The other options - [1]. a paper-lined surface, [3]. a wood-lined one, and [4]. a cotton-lined surface - are not strong conductors of electrical energy and thus, would not be the main cause of an electric shock. Metals are good conductors due to the presence of free electrons that can move through the material when a voltage is applied across it. The nature of the atomic structure of metals allows the electrons to move easily within the lattice, facilitating the movement of electric charges and, subsequently, electric current. On the other hand, insulators like paper, wood, and cotton are poor conductors of electrical energy due to their atomic structure. Insulators have tightly bound electrons that do not allow the free movement of electric charges. This inability to move freely makes it difficult for the electric current to pass through these materials. Let us examine each of the materials individually to understand their conductive properties better: 1. Paper-lined surface: Paper is made from cellulose fibers, which are long chains of organic molecules derived from plant material. The structure of paper does not allow free movement of electrons, making it a poor conductor of electricity. 2. Steel-lined surface: Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, and sometimes other elements like chromium or nickel. It is an excellent conductor of electricity, due to its metallic nature that allows a large number of free electrons to move through it when a voltage is applied. If a person gets an electric shock, it is likely because the steel-lined surface was in contact with live electrical components. 3. Wood-lined surface: Wood is an organic material mostly consisting of cellulose fibers and lignin. While wood is a poor conductor of electricity, it can conduct electricity to some extent, especially when wet or if it contains a significant amount of moisture. However, in general, wood is considered an insulating material, and touching a wood-lined surface is less likely to cause an electric shock. 4. Cotton-lined surface: Cotton is a natural fiber derived from the cotton plant, and it is primarily composed of cellulose. Similar to paper and wood, cotton is a poor conductor of electricity. It acts as an insulator, preventing the flow of electric currents. Consequently, touching a cotton-lined surface will not likely result in an electric shock. In conclusion, if a person experiences an electric shock from a faulty system, the most probable surface touched would be a steel-lined one. This is due to the conductive properties of steel, which allows the transmission of electrical energy through the material. Paper, wood, and cotton are poor conductors of electricity and are less likely to be responsible for the electric shock."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mike Answer:","completion":"Title: Blood Ties Genre: Crime Thriller/Action/Drama Plot: Act I: The movie begins with the introduction of Lou Ford, a determined and ambitious detective in a crime-infested city. He vowed to clean it up and put an end to the criminal organizations running rampant. Lou comes from a broken family, with an abusive father and a deceased mother. We are introduced to Lou's older step-brother, Mike, who had parted ways with the family many years ago. Mike is now successfully running an art gallery in a different city. Lou receives news about Mike's return to the city for a special art exhibition, and he is eager to reconnect with his estranged step-brother. Meanwhile, the city's most dangerous crime boss, Vincent, has been keeping a close eye on Lou following his attempts to dismember his empire. To keep Lou in check, Vincent decides to infiltrate the art exhibition, posing as a legitimate businessman and philanthropist looking to contribute to the local art scene. Act II: As the art exhibition commences, Lou and Mike finally reunite after years of separation. They discuss their past and the different paths they've taken, with Mike expressing his wish to one day leave the art world and focus on something meaningful.

Unbeknownst to Lou and Mike, Vincent plans to use the art gallery as a front for money laundering and other illegal activities. Lou, however, begins to grow suspicious as he sees Vincent's influence taking shape in the gallery.

They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind. They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores. Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a story that ends with this sentence. His fingernails are much shorter.","completion":"Once upon a time in the far-off land of Veritas, there lived an old man named Maldwyn. He was known far and wide for his exceptionally long fingernails that stretched out like gnarled, twisted branches from his fingertips. Some said his nails were magical and had healing powers, while others believed Maldwyn was cursed. Maldwyn lived in a small cottage at the edge of the dense Whispering Woods, where the sun rarely broke through the tangle of trees. No one dared to venture deep into the forest, but its edges teemed with life and prosperity. People would come from all around to see Maldwyn, hoping for cures to their ailments and answers to their heart's desires. One damp and dusky evening, as Maldwyn sat on his porch, listening to the gentle song of the crickets, a stranger approached. He had piercing green eyes, a faint smile, and well-worn boots that spoke of a life on the road. Maldwyn invited the stranger to share a cup of tea and listen to the tales he had collected over the years. As the night wore on, Maldwyn became more and more curious about this mysterious man with a shadowed past. The stranger, whose name was Varden, stayed up with Maldwyn, sharing stories of his many travels and the adventures he had had. For the first time in his life, Maldwyn felt a deep kinship with someone who seemed to understand the intricacies of life. As dawn approached, Varden turned to Maldwyn and said, “My old friend, you have made me feel welcomed and at home. Now I have a favor to ask. You see, my daughter, Mara, has a crippling illness, and her body grows weaker by the day. You are known far and wide for your healing abilities, and now, I must implore you to help her.” Maldwyn hesitated. Despite his long years of granting wishes, he had never been faced with such a personal request. But his love for his newfound friend was strong, and he knew that he couldn't let Varden down. The journey to Varden’s village took several weeks, but Maldwyn’s heart grew lighter with each step he took towards the world he’d never seen. As they walked along the dusty roads, Varden entertained Maldwyn with stories of the idyllic village nestled among rolling hills and towering trees heavy with fruit. Finally, they reached the village, and Maldwyn eagerly set about preparing a magical concoction in the hopes of healing the ailing Mara. As he lay his hands upon her fragile body, he could feel the power surging through his fingers, carried along by his unusually long fingernails. Mara's illness began to subside, and her strength slowly returned. However, with each ounce of her recovery, Maldwyn could feel his own energy depleting. Mara's smile once again lit up the village, but Maldwyn's magical abilities waned, and over time, his magnificent nails began to shrink. One evening, as Maldwyn tended to his garden, and Varden approached him, the depth of his gratitude etched in his gaze. “Maldwyn, my dear friend, I can never repay you for your kindness. Because of you, my daughter's laughter fills the air, and her smile is like the sun rising over the hilltops.” With a knowing smile, Maldwyn replied, “Varden, it was a sacrifice well worth making, for I've learned love and friendship are worth more than a hundred magical abilities.” As Maldwyn sat on the porch of his small cottage, a breeze rustling through the trees, he looked down at his hands. No longer the hands of a mysterious and feared healer, but of a man who had embraced the magic of love and friendship. His fingernails are much shorter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tim Bresnan turned the tide when he had opener David Warner caught behind for 71 and Broad followed up with a devastating burst of 6-20 in 45 balls to finish with 11 wickets in the match. \\"What a wonderful, dramatic day. This match was a wonderful advert for Test cricket, today in particular. It ebbed and flowed - that's what you want - not this crash, bang, wallop, 20 or 50 overs. \\"Anyone who tells me Twenty20 is better than this is an idiot. It's about seeing bowlers and batsmen straining. Then it boils down to England being better at the pressure moments.\\" A breathless and barely believable evening session, in which nine wickets fell, ended in fading light at 19:40 BST when Broad had Peter Siddle caught at mid-off to put England 3-0 up in the series with one match to play. Amazingly, less than two hours before the final wicket fell, it appeared far more likely that Australia would be heading to The Oval on 21 August with a chance of levelling the series. The tourists made the ideal start to their run chase as Warner and Chris Rogers put on 109 for the first wicket - Australia's first century opening partnership in the Ashes since The Oval in 2005. Rogers eventually fell one short of a half-century - caught by Jonathan Trott at slip off Swann - but even when the off-spinner followed up with the wicket of Usman Khawaja for 21, there was little sign of the madness that followed. The turning point arrived when Bresnan produced a superb delivery to remove the dangerous Warner, who was drawn into pushing at a ball angled across him and got a thin nick through to Matt Prior. Sensing their opportunity, England pounced in ruthless fashion. Broad sent captain Michael Clarke's off stump cart-wheeling before Steve Smith played on as he attempted to pull. England have never won four Tests in a home Ashes series The last time they won three in a series at home was in 1985 when they won the series 3-1 England have won two Ashes series 3-0: 1886 (a three-Test series) and 1977 Their biggest Ashes series win is 5-1 in 1978-79. They have won 4-1 three times in Australia: 1911-12, 1928-29 and 1932-33 Roared on by the England supporters in the Chester-le-Street crowd, Bresnan trapped Shane Watson in front to leave Australia in disarray. Broad, bowling as quickly and aggressively as at any time in his career, then had Brad Haddin and Ryan Harris lbw before bowling Nathan Lyon. With just one wicket needed, England were granted an extra half-hour but, with the light fading, the umpires insisted on them bowling spinners from both ends. Six overs came and went without any great alarm before the reappearance of the setting sun gave Alastair Cook the opportunity to go back to his pacemen. Six balls from James Anderson failed to deliver the breakthrough but, when Broad returned from the Lumley End, it took him only three to induce a false stroke from Siddle and send the crowd into raptures. Broad's match figures of 11-121 were the finest of his career and the best by an England bowler in the Ashes since Phil Tufnell's 11-93 at The Oval in 1997. Earlier, Australia took England's last five wickets for 96 runs to bowl them out for 330, with Harris claiming 7-117. The outstanding fast bowler, whose omission from the first Test is beginning to look like a glaring oversight, bowled centurion Ian Bell and Prior with successive balls and ended a brief cameo of 13 from Broad with a brutal bouncer that he gloved to gully. 1st Test: England won by 14 runs, Trent Bridge 2nd Test: England won by 347 runs, Lord's 3rd Test: Match drawn, Old Trafford 4th Test: England won by 74 runs, Chester-le-Street 5th Test: 21-25 August, The Oval Bresnan, who made 45, and Swann fought back with a crucial attacking partnership of 42 and, by the time Anderson was last man out, England had pushed their lead to within two runs of 300.

Gather the necessary tools and materials: I would need a clean cutting board, an angel food cake, a serrated knife, and a serving plate. A serrated knife is important for cutting through the delicate texture of the angel food cake without compressing or squishing it. 2. Let the cake cool: If the cake has just been baked, I would wait for it to cool down to room temperature. Allowing the cake to cool will make it easier to cut without falling apart, and it will also prevent the cake from sticking to the knife. 3. Place the cake on the cutting board: I would gently transfer the angel food cake onto the cutting board. Placing the cake on a cutting board provides a stable and secure surface for slicing. 4. Decide on the size of the slices: Before starting to slice the cake, I would think about the desired size of the pieces. This decision will help guide my cuts and make the process more efficient. 5. Hold the knife properly: I would grip the serrated knife by the handle, and hold it securely with my dominant hand. Using a serrated knife will help gently saw through the cake without applying too much pressure and crushing the cake's texture. 6. Begin cutting the cake: I would start by cutting the cake in half, using a gentle sawing motion with the serrated knife. It's essential to maintain light pressure and avoid pressing down on the cake to preserve its airy texture. 7. Cut the cake into smaller slices: After cutting the cake in half, I would proceed to slice each half into evenly-sized pieces, using the same gentle sawing motion. 8. Transfer the slices to a serving plate: I would use a spatula or cake server to carefully lift each slice from the cutting board to the serving plate, making sure not to damage the delicate texture. 9. Clean up: After completing the task of chopping the angel food cake, I would clean up the workspace by washing the cutting board, knife, and any other tools used. By following these steps, I can efficiently and effectively chop angel food cake, while preserving its delicate texture and ensuring that it looks appealing on the serving plate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about bags - yes, those things we use to carry our stuff when we go shopping or pack our lunch for school. But did you know that the number of bags given out has changed a lot in some places? Let's find out why! Recently, in some areas, the total number of bags given out has gone up by 12 per cent in just two years. That's like adding 12 more bags to every 100 bags! Quite a lot of bags, isn't it? However, in a place called Wales, the story is different. They have to pay 5p (that's five pennies) for a bag, and because of that, fewer bags are being used. Just imagine if you had to pay 5p for every bag - maybe you'd think twice before taking one too! This is a smart move as it encourages people to reuse bags they already have or to use bags made from better materials that last longer. Now, you might wonder why this is important. Well, many of these bags we use for just a few minutes, like when we bring home some candies or a toy, but they take a very, very long time to break down and go away. How long, you ask? A thousand years! That's older than your great-great-great-great-great-great grandma! When bags take that long to break down, it means they stay around and can hurt our environment, especially the animals we love so much. So, by using fewer bags or using better bags, we're helping to keep our world clean and safe for us and our animal friends. So, the next time you go to the store or pack your lunch, remember the big changes happening in the world of bags. Try to use bags that are strong and can be used many times or even bags made from materials that are better for our environment.

Maybe one of these dads will make you remember your own dad! The male giant water bug doesn't seem to mind a heavy load on his back for his kids. The female puts about 100 to 150 eggs on the back of the male, and then she leaves. Once the female is gone, the male has to look after the eggs. It usually takes one to two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The father giant water bug jumps around to make sure the growing eggs get enough air and water. All this time he can't fly because of the weight of the eggs growing rapidly on his back. Now let's turn to the male stickleback fish. When the mother leaves after laying her eggs, the father tends his young. If the young fish go too far away, their father helps with their safe return by carrying them back in his mouth. The male stickleback looks after all his young -- as many as 100 -- until they can live on their own. A similar example can be found in emperor penguins living in cold areas. The male emperor penguin goes without food while looking after his egg until it hatches. For about 62 to 67 days, the egg stays on top of the father's feet, in very cold temperatures that drop down to -39deg C. As a result, the father may lose nearly 50 percent of his body weight while waiting for his baby penguin to be born!

For instance, dogs often use specific body signals to communicate their intent to play. Some common play signals to look for include: 1. Play bow: A dog might crouch down on their front legs with their rear end in the air. This usually indicates an invitation to play. 2. Relaxed body and facial muscles: A dog engaged in playful behavior will often exhibit relaxed and loose body language, such as a wagging tail and a soft, open mouth. 3. Playful vocalizations: A dog might communicate playfulness with high-pitched barks, yips, or whines. 4. Running or jumping around: Playful dogs might engage in bouts of running or jumping around each other and entice the other dog to join in the activity. If these playful elements are present during the interactions between the smaller and larger rottweiler dogs, it may indicate that they are playing rather than displaying aggressive or dominant behavior. However, even if the dogs are playing, it still does not conclusively confirm their relationship as mother and daughter. To establish their family connection, additional information about their genetic relationship, age difference, and ownership history would be required. In conclusion, while the initial statement \\"Two rottweiler dogs indoors, the smaller one barking at the larger\\" may hint at a playful interaction between the two dogs, it does not provide enough information to determine if they are a mother and daughter or if they are, in fact, engaged in a playful exchange. A more comprehensive assessment of their behavior and relationship is necessary to draw a reliable conclusion."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person that was evacuated from Leningrad? is inside the article: The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces. Dmitri Shostakovich had intended the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert. Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of psychological warfare. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects. The conductor concluded that \\"in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine\\". Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"Dmitri Shostakovich"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The history was discovered this week by construction workers at Emerson High School on N. Walker. The school is being renovated as part of the Maps for Kids plan. Contractors planned to find a number of problems inside the walls, but they didn't plan on finding treasures. \\"Well first of all I got goosebumps, and then I got tears in my eyes,\\" said Emerson HS Principal Sherry Kishore. \\"And then I sat in here and just stared because it's really like walking into a time capsule.\\" When crews tore open the walls of Cinthea Comer's 10th grade English classroom, lessons from decades past were revealed. \\"We have this ship and the rock with 1620 and then we have a log cabin,\\" Comer described. There were three other classrooms besides Comers that had hidden slate blackboards with chalk drawings and lessons. All of them have a similar Thanksgiving theme. There are pictures of pilgrims, turkeys, and Mayflower ships. The teachers had used bright, colorful chalk and wrote in exquisite cursive. \\"When you walk into these rooms it's like they just left the lesson and they're expecting to come back the next day and start again,\\" Kishore said. It's a look at a time most of us have never seen. Kishore and the teachers believe that time was 100 years ago. Written on many of the boards was the date 1917. \\"You walk in and you see 1917 in front of you with the way that they taught lessons then,\\" Kishore said. \\"It was very emotional for me.\\" Comer said, \\"It's like a looking glass into the teachings of 1917, and it's just so amazing how well preserved they are.\\" While there's no definitive proof the lessons are from 1917, the evidence is hard to argue with. It's history the district says it will work to preserve. The boards may be too delicate to remove so the district is looking into a way to preserve them without removing them. ||||| (Oklahoma City Public Schools) Teachers and students scribbled the lessons — multiplication tables, pilgrim history, how to be clean — nearly 100 years ago. And they haven’t been touched since. This week, contractors removing old chalkboards at Emerson High School in Oklahoma City made a startling discovery: Underneath them rested another set of chalkboards, untouched since 1917. “The penmanship blows me away, because you don’t see a lot of that anymore,” Emerson High School Principal Sherry Kishore told the Oklahoman. “Some of the handwriting in some of these rooms is beautiful.” (Oklahoma City Public Schools) The chalkboards being removed to make way for new whiteboards are in four classrooms, according to the Oklahoma City Public School District. A spokeswoman said the district is working with the city to “preserve the ‘chalk’ work of the teachers that has been captured in time.” [WWI graffiti discovered deep underground. ‘All these guys wanted to be remembered.’] A wheel that apparently was used to teach multiplication tables appears on one board. “I have never seen that technique in my life,” Kishore told the Oklahoman. (Oklahoma City Public Schools) The boards carry not just teachers’ work, but also that of students, and every room has a lesson on pilgrims, according to the district. “Their names are here; I don’t know whether they were students in charge that day that got to do the special chores if they were the ones that had a little extra to do because they were acting up,” Kishore said. “But it’s all kinds of different feelings when you look at this.” (Oklahoma City Public Schools) (Oklahoma City Public Schools) (Oklahoma City Public Schools) (Oklahoma City Public Schools) You find a lesson on pilgrims in every classroom.

Gary Mulholland of The Observer considers the release of Is This It a \\"world-changing moment\\" and notes that its impact was \\"immediate and dramatic\\" on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to \\"skinny jeans and guitars\\", \\"the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day\\". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it \\"caused a sea change\\" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for \\"other new-wavers\\" to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired \\"a ragged revolt\\" in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that \\"a fine brood of heirs\\", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated \\"rock's obsession with having a good time\\". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album was one of the main reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, \\"The title track was one of the first basslines I learned ... I was just 15 at the time.\\"Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald argues that, although Is This It provided substantial musical influence, its biggest success was in revamping the music industry and making A&R delegates scout and promote alternative bands. Gunn links the success of alternative music in British charts throughout the 2000s to the album, but notes that \\"the copyists\\" could never match the attention to detail and heartfelt emotion of the Strokes. Mulholland adds that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered disco, electro, and synthpop owe a debt to the record, because its commercial success \\"made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention\\".

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: José C. Vales (born 1965, Zamora) is a Spanish writer and translator of English literature. He studied in Salamanca and Madrid. He has translated numerous English and American authors into Spanish, including Dickens, Trollope, Austen, Wilkie Collins, Defoe, Mary Shelley, Arnold Bennett, Eudora Welty, Stella Gibbons, E.F. Benson, and Edmund Crispin. Hypothesis: José C. Vales' first language in English.","completion":"From the given context, it would not be accurate to draw the hypothesis that José C. Vales' first language is English. Instead, we can infer that his first language is most likely Spanish given that he was born in Zamora, Spain, and later studied in Salamanca and Madrid. The context does not provide any information indicating that English would be his first language. Additionally, the statement mentions that he is a translator of English literature, translating works from English to Spanish, suggesting that he is well-versed in both languages. However, this does not necessarily mean that his first language is English. It is common for individuals from non-English speaking countries to learn English as a second language in school or through other educational programs. As a result, it is plausible that José C. Vales acquired English proficiency later in his life, allowing him to translate English literary works into his native language, which in this case, appears to be Spanish. In conclusion, based on the available context, we can infer that José C. Vales' first language is probably Spanish, considering his birthplace in Spain and the fact that he translates English literature into Spanish. It is essential to recognize that the context does not directly provide Vales' first language and that the hypothesis is drawn based on the information we have at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let x be the number of 20-paise coins and y be the number of 25-paise coins. We know that the man has a total of 50 coins, so: x + y = 50 We also know that the total value of the coins is Rs.11.25 (which is equal to 1125 paise). Therefore, the value of 20-paise coins + the value of 25-paise coins = 1125 paise. So, 20x + 25y = 1125 Now, we have a system of two linear equations: 1. x + y = 50 2. 20x + 25y = 1125 We can solve these equations to find the value of x (the number of 20-paise coins). First, multiply equation 1 by 20 to make the x-coefficient in both equations the same: 20x + 20y = 1000 Now subtract this new equation from equation 2: (20x + 25y) - (20x + 20y) = 1125 - 1000 5y = 125 Divide by 5: y = 25 Now, we can substitute this value back into equation 1: x + 25 = 50 Subtract 25 from both sides: x = 25 The number of 20-paise coins is 25, so the answer is Option D: 25."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Ronald Shannon Jackson (January 12, 1940 - October 19, 2013) was an American jazz drummer and composer from Fort Worth, Texas. A pioneer of avant-garde jazz, free funk, and jazz fusion, he appeared on over 50 albums as a bandleader, sideman, arranger, and producer. Jackson and bassist Sirone are the only musicians to have performed and recorded with the three prime shapers of free jazz: pianist Cecil Taylor, and saxophonists Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler. Context: Once in New York, Jackson performed with many jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Betty Carter, Jackie McLean, Joe Henderson, Kenny Dorham, McCoy Tyner, Stanley Turrentine, and others. Whenever he would ask Charles Mingus to consider him for his group, Mingus used to push him \\"rudely out of his way\\". After Jackson sat in with pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi, he heard loud clapping behind him. It was Mingus, who asked him to play with his band. In 1966 Jackson recorded drums for saxophonist Charles Tyler's release, Charles Tyler Ensemble. Between 1966 and 1967, he played with saxophonist Albert Ayler and is featured on At Slug's Saloon, Vol. 1 & 2. He is also on disks 3 and 4 of Ayler's Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Records (1962-70). Jackson said Ayler was \\"the first (leader) that really opened me up. He let me play the drums the way I did in Fort Worth when I wasn't playing for other people.\\" John Coltrane's death in July 1967 devastated Jackson. He spent the next few years addicted to heroin. He said, \\"I couldn't play drums then, spiritually.... I just didn't feel right.\\" From 1970-74, he did not perform, but continued to practice. In 1974, pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs introduced Jackson to Nichiren Buddhism and chanting. Although initially reluctant, Jackson decided to try it for three weeks. \\"Then three months had passed. It pulled me together and pulled me out and I was able to focus. I was a Buddhist and a vegetarian for 17 years.\\" By 1975 he joined saxophonist Ornette Coleman's electric free funk band, Prime Time. During his stint in Prime Time, Coleman taught Jackson composition and harmolodics. Jackson says that Coleman told him he was hearing music \\"in that piccolo range,\\" and encouraged him to compose on the flute. Jackson went to Paris with Prime Time in 1976 to perform concerts and record Dancing in Your Head and Body Meta. In 1978, Jackson played on four albums with pianist Cecil Taylor: Cecil Taylor Unit, 3 Phasis, Live in the Black Forest, and One Too Many Salty Swift and Not Goodbye. Question: What was his career?

In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. and the situation: Matt is reheating some leftover pizza in the microwave for his stepchildren, Lauren and Emily. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds.

Here is another sentence: Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet. Does the term pull mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"To determine if the term \\"pull\\" means the same thing in both sentences, I will analyze each sentence and their context. 1. Analyzing the first sentence: \\"The pull of the current.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" refers to the force exerted by the water current, which causes objects to be carried along with the flow. Here, \\"pull\\" is used to describe a natural force generated by the movement of water. 2. Analyzing the second sentence: \\"Iron fillings drawn by the pull of a magnet.\\" In this sentence, \\"pull\\" refers to the force exerted by a magnet on the iron fillings, causing them to be attracted and move towards the magnet. Here, \\"pull\\" is used to describe a force related to magnetism. Now, I will compare the meanings of \\"pull\\" in both sentences. The term \\"pull\\" in both sentences refers to a force that acts to move objects. In the first sentence, this force is due to the water current, while in the second sentence, it is due to the magnetism. Although the sources of the forces are different, the general meaning of the term \\"pull\\" in both sentences remains the same, i.e., a force that causes movement or attraction. In conclusion, the term \\"pull\\" means the same thing in both sentences, as it refers to a force that causes objects to be drawn or moved towards something.

Step 2: Identifying the main elements in the quotation The quotation mentions three main factors that led to Libya's status as an international pariah: 1. Unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad 2. Support for foreign militants 3. Alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing Step 3: Analyzing the historical accuracy Now, let's examine if these factors accurately represent the historical events that led to Libya's pariah status. 1. Border conflicts with Egypt and Chad: Indeed, Gaddafi's regime was involved in border conflicts with neighboring countries, which led to regional instability. This fact is relevant and contributes to the explanation. 2. Support for foreign militants: Gaddafi's regime was known for financially and militarily supporting various militant groups worldwide, including Irish Republican Army (IRA), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and several groups in the Middle East and Africa. This support of militant and extremist organizations further strained Libya's foreign relations, making it a relevant point. 3. Lockerbie bombing: The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, is one of the most infamous incidents attributed to Gaddafi's regime. Evidence suggested that Libyan intelligence was involved, and this led to severe international pressure on Libya, including sanctions by the United Nations. This incident further cemented Libya's pariah status. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the quotation provided by the user is an accurate representation of the main factors that contributed to Libya being labeled as an \\"international pariah\\" under Gaddafi's rule.

My sales professional Jose Diaz-Caballero did an awesome job selling me the car, but once the deal was out if his hands that's where my entire experience went south. I came in at noon to test drive a vehicle. I really enjoyed the car, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Jose sold me on and the price was right. I said I would take it depending in what they would offer me for my trade. They took my car keys and sat me at Jose's desk for 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and needed to get back to work, but alas I couldn't leave as they had my keys. I finally found my car and keys and went back to work. I had explained to Jose that I would be financing thru my own credit union and already had that arranged. I asked him to get the paperwork ready, I would come by and sign it then go to my CU and pick up the check and come back with it. I also explained that I had stuff to do after work and didn't have time to be waiting around for delivery. Jose understood. He finally gets back to me at close to 4pm and tells me that his manager said the deal is contingent on me financing thru the dealership (one of the banks they deal with), and that I have to finance thru them on order to buy a car! I said what if I pay cash and they say No, I have to finance thru them, that's it. I reluctantly agree as it is Friday getting close to 5pm and my CU will be closing. I head back to work and close up and come back to the dealership expecting this to wrap up quickly. Instead I sit and wait till 530pm when Peter Bothe from the Finance Department finally comes and goes over the deal with me. He explains they've found me financing (I already had my own, thank you) and their rate is 6% higher than the rate from my credit union. I tell them this is ridiculous to sell the car to someone else. I go outside, and realize that Jose, my salesman, shouldn't have to lose a sale just because of the attitude of management. I used to sell cars so I understand how that goes. I went back in and Peter Wisnewski (sales manager) came and talked to me explained that \\"this is how they do things\\" and that \\"the deal is contingent upon me taking their financing.\\" He then tells me that they are giving me the \\"opportunity\\" to buy a car from them. Oh what an honor!! Peter Wisnewski next told me that I won't get a better value anywhere else or as much for my trade-in, however they were matching what another dealership (Zimbrick BMW) had previously offered me. I decided to go ahead with their financing and set up a refinance the next business day with my Credit Union. My sales person Jose did offer me free car washes to try to redeem the dealership, which is appreciated. While I was waiting at Jose's desk, Emily, another sales person, came up to me an appologized for the games the management was playing with me, and she even helped me gather my belongings from my trade. She was very helpful and sweet, and really helped to diffuse my anger. I have previously used the Service Department at Wilde East Towne Honda and dealt with Cheryl Batease who was simply wonderful. If you have to have service done at Wilde I would recommend working with Cheryl.

What is the most logical next event? How to make maple syrup Make sure your trees are ready to be tapped. Maple season occurs during the spring when nights are below 32 degrees fahrenheit (0 degrees celsius) and days are starting to get warm. This causes the sap to start flowing in trees.","completion":"The most logical next event after making sure your trees are ready to be tapped is to begin the process of tapping the maple trees to collect sap. Here is a detailed guide on how to tap maple trees and make maple syrup. 1. Identify the right trees: To start, you need to identify the maple trees in your area. Sugar maples (Acer saccharum) are the most commonly tapped for maple syrup production, but other maple species like red maple (Acer rubrum) and black maple (Acer nigrum) can also be used. Look for trees that have a trunk diameter of at least 12 inches, as smaller trees may not produce much sap and could be damaged by the tapping process. 2. Gather necessary materials: You will need a drill, a spile (a small spout used to collect sap), a hammer, a food-grade container to collect the sap, and a lid or cover to protect the sap from rain and debris. 3. Choose the right time: Timing is crucial for tapping maple trees. The best time to tap is when daytime temperatures are above freezing (32°F or 0°C), but nighttime temperatures are still below freezing. This is typically between late February and early April, depending on your location. 4. Select the tap location: Choose a spot on the tree that is easily accessible and faces South or Southwest, as these areas receive the most sunlight and will produce the best sap flow. The tap should be placed at least 3-4 feet above the ground and at least 6 inches away from any previous tap holes. 5. Drill the hole: Using a drill bit that matches the size of your spile, drill a hole into the tree at a slight upward angle, around 1.5 to 2 inches deep. Make sure to clear out any wood shavings that may block the flow of sap. 6. Insert the spile: Gently tap the spile into the hole with a hammer until it fits snugly in place. Be cautious not to hit the spile too hard, as this could damage the tree or the spile itself. 7. Attach the container: Connect your food-grade container to the spile, making sure it is secured and stable. Place a lid or cover on the container to prevent rain, snow, and debris from contaminating the sap. 8. Monitor the sap flow: Sap flow can vary depending on factors like temperature, sunlight, and tree health. Check your containers daily, and be prepared to replace or empty them as needed. A single tap can produce anywhere from 5 to 15 gallons of sap during the season. 9. Process the sap into syrup: Once you have collected enough sap, it is time to turn it into maple syrup. To do this, you will need to boil the sap to evaporate the water and concentrate the sugar content. A general rule of thumb is that it takes 40 gallons of sap to produce one gallon of syrup. Use a large pot or evaporator to heat the sap, making sure to filter out any debris or impurities. As the sap boils down, sugar content will increase, and the syrup will darken. Monitor the temperature carefully – when it reaches 7°F above the boiling point of water (219°F or 104°C), your syrup is ready. Be cautious not to overcook the syrup, as this can result in a burnt flavor. 10. Bottle and store your syrup: Once the syrup has reached the desired consistency and temperature, let it cool slightly before filtering it one more time. Pour the syrup into sterilized jars or bottles and seal them tightly to ensure freshness. Once properly bottled, maple syrup can be stored for up to a year or more. In conclusion, the most logical next event after making sure your maple trees are ready to be tapped is to follow the steps outlined above to tap the trees, collect sap, and transform that sap into delicious maple syrup.

Question: Given the fact that: On a hot day, an endotherm may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. Answer the question: If Jim is an endotherm would his body give off more or less heat if the blood flow to the surface of his body were increased? Answer:","completion":"If Jim is an endotherm, increasing the blood flow to the surface of his body would make his body give off more heat. To fully understand this, it's essential to understand the term endotherm. Endotherms are organisms that maintain their body temperature at a metabolically favourable temperature, mostly warm, by adjusting the heat produced internally from metabolic processes in the body. Humans are a typical example of endothermic organisms. Body heat in endothermic organisms like Jim is mainly produced through cellular respiration, a metabolic process. This metabolic heat is carried around the body by the circulatory system, commonly referred to as the blood. Now, when the blood flow to the surface of the body is increased, it means that more of this inner body heat brought about by metabolism is brought to the body surface. In normal circumstances, the skin acts as a barrier preventing too much heat loss from the body. However, during intense physical activity or in hot weather conditions, the body naturally tries to prevent overheating. One of the ways it does this is by dilating the blood vessels in the skin -- a process known as vasodilation. Increased blood flow to the surface of the body means more warm blood reaches the skin. As the warmed blood flows through the dilated vessels at the body surface, heat is given off to the surrounding environment from the body through radiation, conduction, convection, and/or evaporation. Therefore, the heat loss from the body is increased, thus cooling the body down. So, in conclusion, if Jim is indeed an endotherm, increasing the blood flow to the surface of his body would result in his body giving off more heat, not less. This is a well-established physiological strategy that allows endotherms to regulate and maintain their body temperature within safe limits, especially in hot conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Health experts at the annual meeting of the Gerontological Society of America this weekend shed new light on exercise's value as a strong tool in combating diseases often associated with aging. \\"How you live after age 65 is vitally important,\\" says Laura Carstensen, director of the Stanford Center on Longevity. \\"Up until then, a healthy life is dominated by your genes. After that, it's predominantly about lifestyle. Exercise and nutrition become more important.\\" Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, obesity, arthritis, and certain cancers appear more often in later life. To help fight dementia, play memory games if you want, but it might be better to \\"invest in a good pair of walking shoes,\\" says Peggye Dilworth-Anderson, the gerontology society's president and a board member of the national Alzheimer's Association. That thinking is consistent with a study reported by University of Pittsburgh researchers in October showing older adults who walk 6 to 9 miles a week have a lower risk for cognitive decline later in life. A Saturday session at the meeting titled \\"Exercise as an Aging Intervention\\" attempted to show how physical activity can restore muscular strength in the elderly. The current genome study by Simon Melov of Buck Institute for Age Research in Novato, Calif., compares the genes of a young person whose leg is immobilized for two weeks in a brace with the genes of an older person who suffers from sarcopenia, a muscle-wasting disease affecting old people. Both age groups responded successfully to exercise and made improvements. \\"We're hoping there are better solutions for aging,\\" says Melov. But no one has to run a marathon to regain strength. Walking down a hospital wing can jump-start improvement, according to LaDora Thompson of the University of Minnesota's department of physical medicine and rehabilitation. She studied how physical therapy can reverse the damage of inactivity. Even activities as simple as standing and walking improve muscle strength. Cancer patients have traditionally been advised to back off exercise and let their bodies rest and recover, but Kathryn Schmitz of the University of Pennsylvania has done research that shows the benefits of exercise for people undergoing treatments. One reason for all this emphasis on physical activity is the USA's rapidly aging population. Life expectancy has soared to 79.9 years. Boomers currently have a 50% chance of being alive at 85. Many could be centenarians. \\"Our job is to make use of the added years,\\" says Carstensen. \\"It would be immoral to receive this gift and squander it.\\" Nanna Notthoff, a graduate student who works with Carstensen at Stanford, presented a study Saturday on communication messages about exercise. Frame it positively, and there's success, she says. \\"When people are told about the physical, cognitive and psychological gains from exercise, their levels of exercise increased over time,\\" Notthoff says. \\"If they were told something like 'Imagine how fat and sick you'll be if you don't exercise,' their levels of exercise dropped below their baseline scores.\\" Just imagine how good you will feel … You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Question: This article: Wives and girlfriends sit together at a Sox game to watch Wacky Waters pitch. He's a fun-loving guy who is delighted to learn that Hollywood star Pepita Zorita is at today's game, selling kisses for charity. Wacky promptly borrows money from team publicity man Updyke to buy 300 worth. In the grandstand, catcher Hippo Jones's wife Hazel and the other women are concerned. Wacky is the best pitcher in baseball when he concentrates on what he's doing, but whenever a pretty girl turns his head, a distracted Wacky suddenly can't throw the ball over the plate. The wives want the Sox to be in the World Series so their husbands will receive bonus money. Sure enough, Wacky's infatuation with Pepita begins a run of bad luck for him and the Sox at the ballpark. On the train, the wives protest until Wacky discloses that he and Pepita secretly ran off to get married. While they are happy for the couple, Hazel schemes to have a Hollywood producer require Pepita's presence to shoot a movie there. This could keep Wacky focused on baseball until the World Series. Pepita finishes the film faster than expected. She hurries to Kansas City to see Wacky and the Sox, so the wives take matters into their own hands, tying up Pepita in a hotel room against her will. Wacky eventually wins the World Series for the Sox, but this time, it's only because the woman he loves is there. contains an answer for the question: What's the first name of the person whose infatuation compromises the Sox performance?, what is it ?

We have a math puzzle that looks like this: -46*i - 4130032 + 4126904 = 0 First, we need to add 4130032 - 4126904. That's like putting 4130032 apples in a basket and taking away 4126904 apples. We'd have 3128 apples left! So now our problem looks like this: -46*i + 3128 = 0 Now, we need to solve for \\"i.\\" It's like having a secret box that multiplies by -46, but we don't know what's in the box! To find out what's inside the box (the value of \\"i\\"), we need to move the 3128 to the other side of the equal sign. To do that, we subtract 3128 from both sides of the equation to keep it balanced: -46*i = -3128 Now, we need to divide both sides by -46 to find out the value of \\"i.\\" So, -3128 divided by -46 is equal to 68.

The colourful bands of shimmering light are usually only seen in the northerly reaches of Scandinavia, Canada and remote parts of Russia. But tonight the display, known as the aurora borealis, is forecast to be on show in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video. Parts of Britain are to be treated to a rare display of the Northern Lights on Friday evening (file picture) The prospect of celestial fireworks in such southerly locations is down to huge explosions on the surface of the Sun. A solar blast last night hurled vast clouds of magnetically charged particles towards Earth – and another explosion is forecast this evening. Known as coronal mass ejections, they can produce many colours, with green, pink, red, blue and yellow all possible. The combined effect of two explosions increases the chance of a display. As they whip towards the Earth, the particles crash into other particles, accelerating and energising them. And when they enter our atmosphere they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the air, which when charged, create the shimmering light that we know as the Aurora Borealis. Often the particles are deflected by the earth’s magnetic field, so the best places to witness it are close to the poles where the field is weakest. Normally, the earth’s magnetic field funnels the high-energy particles – and so the display - towards the North Pole. The display, known as the aurora borealis, is forecast to be on show in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland (file picture) But just occasionally, the sun’s emissions are so violent and so on target, that most of Britain, as far south as East Anglia, gets a ringside seat. Different colours are created depending on the energy of the incoming particles – and the type of atom they hit in the atmosphere. For instance, a red glow, which usually occurs high in the sky, is created by lower energy particles interacting with oxygen. Green lights are caused by slightly more energetic particles, while a purple hue involves nitrogen. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘To view the Northern Lights you are best finding a dark place away from street lights. ‘You will need a cloud-free sky and although there will be some cloud and localised fog patches around this Friday night there should also be some clear skies too. ‘So there is a chance of catching a glimpse of the lights. Your best chance of sighting the aurora will be around midnight.’ Highlights:","completion":"1. The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are predicted to be visible in parts of Northern England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland on Friday evening. 2. This rare sighting in the region is due to two large solar explosions that sent magnetically charged particles toward Earth. 3. These particles, known as coronal mass ejections, interact with Earth's atmosphere and create the shimmering lights of the aurora. 4. Different colors in the aurora result from varying energy levels of incoming particles and the types of atoms they interact with in the atmosphere. 5. To increase the chances of witnessing the Northern Lights, the Met Office suggests finding a dark place away from streetlights, having a cloud-free sky, and observing around midnight."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would this person be craving unhappy events in their life .","completion":"This person might be craving unhappiness and chaos in their life due to a deep-seated sense of self-loathing or self-destructive tendency. According to the passage, the person can only truly recognize themselves when they are in the throes of adversity or suffering, which potentially indicates a self-identity closely aligned with pain, failure and sadness. This self-destructive behaviour can be influenced by various factors such as past traumatic events, unresolved emotional issues, or a persistent feeling of inadequacy. First, a history of traumatic experiences can cause an individual to cultivate a mindset where they perceive disaster and chaos as the norm. Being continuously exposed to stressful situations can foster a warped self-perception that finds comfort in a constant state of crisis and unhappiness, even going as far as deriving self-worth from these incidents because these are the only situations where they feel seen or understood. Second, unresolved emotional issues or mental health disorders can foster a self-destructive tendency. Depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions can lead to negative self-perception and behaviors such as craving disaster. If negative emotions are not addressed or adequately handled, an individual might resign themselves to a perpetual state of unhappiness, thus seeking experiences that confirm their negative self-image. Furthermore, feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem can also lead individuals to crave negative scenarios. They might believe they don't deserve happiness or success due to a skewed self-perception and therefore, subconsciously seek out situations that affirm their preconceived notions about themselves. This internal dialogue of self-criticism can make them feel unworthy of anything positive, prompting a cycle of self-induced negative experiences. The person also seems to acknowledge the negative impact their actions are having on others around them, which might suggest a sense of guilt or an element of self-punishment at play. This could even extend to them being aware of the harmful effects of their actions on their health. Yet, the refusal to change indicates an inability to break free from this destructive cycle, further trapping them in this pattern of behaviour. It is crucial for such a person to seek professional help such as counseling or therapy, to unravel and address these deep-seated issues. Through therapeutic intervention, people can gain insight into their self-destructive tendencies, learn healthier coping mechanisms, build self-esteem, and reshape their narrative to create a healthier relationship with themselves."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best. For example, to absorb heat from the sun to heat water,you need large, flat, black surfaces. One way to do that is to build those surfaces specially, on the roofs of buildings. But why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already, in the form of asphalt roads? Ten years ago, this thought came into the mind of Arian de Bondt, a Dutch engineer. He finally persuaded his boss to follow it up. The result is that their building is now heated in winter and cooled in summer by a system that relies on the surface of the road outside. The heat-collector is a system of connected water pipes. Most of them run from one side of the street to the other, just under the asphalt road. Some, however, dive deep into the groun. When the street surface gets hot in summer, water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes itunderground through one of the diving pipes. At a depth of 100 metres lies a natural aquifer into which heat several heat exchangers have been built. The hot water from the street runs through these exchangers, warming the ground-water, before returning to the surface through another pipe. The aquifer is thus used as a heat store. In winter, the working system is changed slightly. Water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat stored during summer. This water goes into the building and is used to warm the place up. After performing that task, it is pumped under the asphalt and its remaining heat keeps the road free of snow and ice. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following best describes the heat-collector system developed by Arian de Bondt and his team?

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: The assassins of former Defense Minister Enrique Lopez Albujar Trint are presumably members of the Maoist terrorist organization, Shining Path, since the counterterrorism division has identified one of them as Gerardo Olivos Silva, through a composite made from witness' reports. Hypothesis: Gerardo Olivos Silva is a member of the Maoist terrorist organization Shining Path.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that Gerardo Olivos Silva is a member of the Maoist terrorist organization Shining Path from the given context. Let's analyze this context in detail to support our hypothesis. The context consists of information about the assassination of former Defense Minister Enrique Lopez Albujar Trint. The text indicates that the counterterrorism division has identified Gerardo Olivos Silva as one of the assassins through a composite made from witness' reports. This identification implies that the authorities had enough information about the physical appearance and behavior of Gerardo Olivos Silva, which allowed them to link him to the assassination. Moreover, the organization mentioned is the Shining Path, a Maoist terrorist organization with a violent history. Without further context, it is not possible to definitively confirm Gerardo Olivos Silva's membership within Shining Path, but the fact that he was identified as an assassin in an attack presumed to involve the organization strengthens the hypothesis. The link between the assassination and the Shining Path itself is likely based on additional context, such as the context indicating that this incident was militant in nature or had political motivations. Furthermore, the text specifically mentions that the assassins (plural) of the former Defense Minister are \\"presumably members of the Maoist terrorist organization, Shining Path.\\" This statement suggests a strong likelihood that multiple individuals involved in this incident are associated with the organization. Since the counterterrorism division identified Gerardo Olivos Silva as one of the assassins, the hypothesis is likely correct in assuming that he is a member of Shining Path. In summary, the hypothesis that Gerardo Olivos Silva is a member of the Maoist terrorist organization Shining Path can be drawn from the context provided. Although more information might be needed to confirm his exact role within the organization, the text suggests a strong link between the assassination of the former Defense Minister, the Shining Path, and the involvement of Gerardo Olivos Silva.

Many types of bacteriophage exist, some simply infect and lyse their host bacteria, while others insert into the bacterial chromosome. A bacteriophage can contain genes that contribute to its host's phenotype: for example, in the evolution of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Clostridium botulinum, the toxin genes in an integrated phage converted a harmless ancestral bacterium into a lethal pathogen. Bacteria resist phage infection through restriction modification systems that degrade foreign DNA, and a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. This CRISPR system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection. What can viruses do to bacteria? What is the answer?

It can be inferred from the story that Pearl and June spent most of their time together, maybe nearly all their free time. The specific amount is not specified in the narrative, but it's clear that they had a very close and constant companionship. 3. No, Pearl and June were not young. The text mentions that they were both very old and often discussed their health concerns, which included worries about their diet, consequences of the weather, and the potential effects of air pollution. 4. They discussed predominantly health-related topics. The narrative reveals that most of the time, they talked about their various concerns such as potential health harm from their food, from the weather such as cold and wet conditions potentially causing them bone pains, and from pollution in the air, which they feared could cause chest and throat pains. 5. They worried about their food because they were concerned about its cleanliness. They feared that unclean or poor-quality food might give them stomach pains. Given their advanced age and health concerns, they probably felt more vulnerable to health problems. 6. Pearl and June had many fears related to inadvertent health risks. They feared they might suffer from stomach pains due to unsanitary food, bone pains from cold and wet weather, and chest and throat pains due to air pollution. They also worried about physical harm from car accidents, plane crashes, and various diseases. 7. In addition to their food, weather, and pollution concerns, they were also apprehensive about the potential for accidents, such as being hurt in a car crash or killed in a plane crash. Their fears symbolize a generalized worry about health, safety, and well-being as they aged. 8. Pearl and June's concern about pollution was primarily its potential to cause them health problems. Specifically, they feared that polluted air could give them pains in their chests and throats. This suggests they were especially careful about respiratory health and a possible link to the air quality. 9. Pearl and June went on a train journey together. It's during this journey that the incident with the bananas occurred that leads Pearl to believe that she has gone blind. 10. Everything went black when Pearl took a bite because the train they were on entered a tunnel. The inside of tunnels lacks any natural light, causing darkness until the train emerges from the other side. 11. Pearl mistakenly believed that her loss of sight was a sudden onset of blindness, and she thought it was triggered by eating her banana. This is a humorous misunderstanding; instead of realizing the train was in a tunnel, she jumped to the conclusion that the banana had caused her supposed blindness. 12. Pearl, believing that she had gone blind because of the banana, shouted to June, warning her not to eat her own banana for fear the same would happen to her. This part of the story embodies the central theme of their overthinking and concern about health risks, even in seemingly harmless situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choose your answer from: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"1). no; While the two questions both address the influence of religions on Hitler's actions, they focus on different aspects: the first question asks about the impact of religions on Hitler's aims of making a greater Germany, while the second question explores the influence of religions on his course of actions during World War II. To answer the first question: How did different religions shape Hitler's aims of making a greater Germany? Different religions, particularly Christianity and Judaism, played a significant role in shaping Hitler's aims for a greater Germany. Hitler viewed Christianity, specifically Catholicism and Protestantism, as an essential part of German culture and a unifying force for the country. He sought to leverage this force to create unity among the German people and for his nationalist goals. Conversely, Hitler perceived Judaism as antithetical to German culture and a threat to his vision of a greater Germany. This belief was deeply rooted in the long history of anti-Semitism in Europe, particularly in Germany, that further fueled Hitler's hatred toward Jews. As a result, one of his central aims in creating a greater Germany was the elimination of Jews from the country. This objective manifested in the Holocaust, the genocide of six million Jews during World War II. Moreover, while Hitler advocated for a united German culture, he also aimed to create a homogenous religious structure under a state-controlled church. This goal led to the suppression of smaller religious communities and sects, including Jehovah's Witnesses, who were targeted for their refusal to subscribe to Nazi ideology. To answer the second question: How did different religions shape Hitler's course of actions in WW2? Religions influenced various aspects of Hitler's decisions and actions during World War II, primarily revolving around the complex relationship between the Nazi regime and Christianity, as well as the persecution of the Jewish population. The Nazi regime sought to control and manipulate the Christian message, intending to mold it in line with the nationalist and racist principles of Nazism. This control involved propagating a version of Christianity known as \\"Positive Christianity,\\" which aimed to remove Jewish influence from the religion and emphasize the racial superiority of the Aryan race. Consequently, a significant number of church leaders and religious communities were either co-opted or persecuted by the Nazi regime. Regarding Hitler's course of actions toward the Jewish population, Hitler's anti-Semitic beliefs acted as a driving force in the enactment of policies that would lead to the Holocaust. From the enactment of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 to the Wannsee Conference in 1942, where the \\"Final Solution\\" was conceived, and the subsequent implementation of this plan in extermination camps across occupied Europe, religion played a vital role in the unfolding of these events. Furthermore, Hitler's disdain for other non-Christian religions, such as Islam, influenced his strategy in the Eastern and African theaters, as German and Italian forces sought to utilize Islam in their anti-British campaigns. However, the Nazi regime's inherent racism overshadowed potential alliances, as the primary objective for Hitler remained the establishment of Aryan supremacy. In conclusion, while the two questions might appear similar, they address distinct aspects of the relationship between religion and Hitler's ideology: the aims of making a greater Germany and the course of actions during World War II. The influence of religions such as Christianity and Judaism was undeniable in both contexts, shaping Hitler's beliefs, objectives, and decisions in different, albeit interconnected, ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If your school doesn’t require uniforms, save up to get an outfit or 2 that you like, or get a new pair of shoes to wear for the year. Once you have an outfit that you like, make sure you style it appropriately for school. Keep in mind that whatever you wear should follow your school’s dress code. If you don’t have a lot of room in your budget for a new outfit, mix and match your old clothes to make new outfits, visit a thrift store to find inexpensive clothes, or organize a clothing swap with your friends where you can all trade clothes. Visit an office supply store or local supermarket to pick up a few folders, pencils, notebooks, and other supplies that your school wants you to have. If you’re not sure what you need, check your school’s website, ask a store associate, call the school to ask them, or look up lists for your grade level online. Your classes might require you to get specific supplies, like a protractor for geometry class or a world map for history. You don’t have to get a new backpack and lunch box every year, but if yours have rips or tears in them from last year, remember to get a new one when you’re shopping for school supplies. If you have the time, pick a day and pretend like it’s your first day. Go to bed early the night before, wake up on time, and do your morning routine. Head to the school to see how long it will take you to get there, and go in the school to find your classes and locker if you’re able to. Many schools have new student orientations to introduce the school to new students. See if your school has one of these and go to it to prepare for your first day in a new school! Try to go to bed at your normal “school year” bedtime every night starting about 2 weeks before classes begin. If you’re having trouble getting to bed at night, try waking up earlier so that you’re tired earlier in the day. Try to follow a consistent routine for bedtime, including brushing your teeth, turning off electronics, and taking time to relax. If you need to, try reading a book or listening to calming music before you get ready for bed to get into a relaxed mindset. Whether you’re going to a new school or heading back to the same school, bullying is an issues for many kids. If you’re having anxiety, feeling sad or are scared, sit down with your parents or someone you trust to discuss what’s going on.

If you have a close friend who you can trust, try talking to them about how you’re feeling. If they know you’re worried about being bullied, they’ll be able to watch your back and help you if you do end up in a bad situation. During the school year, if you’re experiencing bullying of any kind, including cyber bullying, don’t be afraid to tell a teacher or school counselor.

Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems. The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex. Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not. She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone. \\"We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,\\"Dr Esprit said.\\"A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.\\" They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur. \\"All these events resulted in death,\\"the doctors wrote.\\"This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.\\" The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, \\"the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use \\"because there is no direct path between you and the lightening\\".

Article: Monkeys , face to face DISCOVER magazine once reported on a curious event in the woods : a group of monkeys applied mud to their faces in order to keep away insects , but when they were done they seemed to have lost their ability to recognize each other ---two monkeys that were supposed to be friends even started fighting. \\"Faces are really important to how monkeys and apes can tell one another apart,\\" explained Michael Alfaro, a biologist at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to the New York -based International Science Times . This is quite different from many other animals , which depend heavily on smells. Since faces play such a crucial part in the social lives of monkeys , could this explain why certain monkey species have such colorful faces while others have simpler, plainer ones ? To test this theory , a group of researchers from UCLA studied 139 monkey species , mainly from Asia and Africa, and analyzed hundreds of headshot photos of those monkeys from their databases. It was found that species that live in larger groups have faces with more complex color patterns than those that live in smaller groups. According to Live Science, researchers believe that this is nature's way of making it easier for monkeys to recognize each other since those living in larger groups have to distinguish between a greater number of faces. This is actually not that hard to understand . Just imagine if there were 10 people standing in front of you, all wearing white clothes. It would be much more difficult to tell them apart than if they wore clothes with colorful patterns. However, if there were only two people that you had to identify, a lack of color wouldn't be much of a problem. Apart from the need to recognize group members , researchers found that geography and environment also affect monkeys' facial colors. Species that live closer to the equator in thick, humid forests were found to have darker faces than those who live in dry areas further away from the equator. This is because darker faces help...

The premise describes the night as being \\"glorious,\\" which generally implies that it was enjoyable or very pleasant, likely with clear skies and a beautiful atmosphere. Furthermore, the night is specifically described as \\"hot\\" and \\"still,\\" meaning that the temperature is quite high, and there is little to no wind or movement in the air. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"The night was frigid\\" proposes that the night had a very low temperature, suggesting that it was extremely cold, which directly contradicts the notion of the night being \\"hot\\" as described in the premise.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

In such a scenario, Pakistan could mistakenly assume the missiles came from India and take actions that everyone might later regret. Therefore, the correct answer is \\"no\\" because the statement \\"Pakistani authorities would get plenty of warning before attacks\\" does not accurately reflect Zinni’s concerns outlined in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many more war boats were there than cargo boats?","completion":"Title: A Comparative Analysis of War Boats and Cargo Boats Throughout History Introduction Over the course of maritime history, humans have used various types of boats for different purposes – from transportation of goods and passengers to naval warfare. This naturally leads us to the question, \\"How many more (or fewer) war boats were there in comparison to cargo boats throughout history?\\" As simple as it might seem, answering this question is challenging due to factors such as fluctuations in the number and type of boats needed over time, the evolution of naval technology, and a lack of comprehensive records of all the war and cargo boats in existence. However, by delving into the history and development of these boats, we may come to a more informed estimation. 1. Ancient Maritime History The earliest form of maritime transport involved the use of simple boats, canoes, and rafts, primarily for fishing and trade. As societies advanced and developed, they began to construct more sophisticated vessels suitable for war and commerce. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, among other civilizations, built both warships and cargo ships. For example, triremes were often used as warships by the Greek and Roman navies, while merchant ships, including the Greek pentekontor and the Roman corbita, were used for the transportation of cargo. In earlier times, cargo boats outnumbered war boats since the focus was on trade and expansion. However, as warfare became more prominent among these ancient societies, the need for warships began to increase. Although accurate data is scarce, we can safely assume that both war and cargo boat production had their respective peaks and troughs, depending on the needs of the society at the time. As a result, it is difficult to provide an exact numerical difference between the number of war and cargo boats in ancient history. 2. The Middle Ages and Early Modern Period During the Middle Ages, the development of war and cargo boats continued alongside each other. Viking longships, for example, were highly versatile vessels with the ability to function efficiently in both war and trade. As a result, discerning the number of war boats compared to cargo boats becomes even more difficult. It is worth noting, however, that during the early modern period, the age of exploration saw a renewed demand for cargo vessels to establish trade networks, while the ongoing occurrence of naval conflict required warships for naval superiority. The 16th and 17th centuries saw the introduction of galleons and carracks, which were particularly multi-functional in their use for both war and trade. 3. The Age of Sail The 18th and 19th centuries, also referred to as the Age of Sail, were characterized by the significant advancements in sailing technology. The Royal Navy and the United States Navy developed various types of warships, including frigates, ships-of-the-line, and schooners, to assert their dominance at sea. Meanwhile, merchants took advantage of clipper ships and various cargo steamers to transport goods efficiently. Despite the absence of exact numbers, it is plausible that the number of cargo boats began to outweigh that of war boats as global trade networks expanded significantly during the Age of Sail. 4. The 20th Century The 20th century saw dramatic changes in maritime warfare and trade, with the advent of new technologies such as submarines, aircraft carriers, and various types of cargo freighters. Both world wars were marked by the introduction of large-scale production of warships, resulting in an increase in the total number of war boats. However, global trade continued to expand throughout the century, leading to the development of commercial shipping vessels like container ships, bulk carriers, and oil tankers. It can be inferred that the number of cargo boats grew significantly during the 20th century, albeit with fluctuations in production depending on various economic circumstances. Conclusion Determining the exact difference in the number of war boats and cargo boats throughout history is immensely difficult due to the variation in historical context, the ever-changing need for both types of boats, the technological advancements impacting vessel design, and the limited availability of accurate data. However, we can conclude that at different points in history, either war boats or cargo boats may have enjoyed temporary numerical superiority over the other, depending on factors such as societal priorities, warfare, and trade demands. Despite being unable to provide exact numerical figures, this analysis highlights the complex interplay between war boats and cargo boats throughout the course of maritime history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: I’m not the smartest guy on the block. In high school I scored “See me” on the math Regents. Still, if I were Commissioner of Major League Baseball, I would look at where the teams play to notice a bunch located in generally warm climates: Two in Texas, two in Florida, two in Southern California, one in Atlanta, one in Arizona. Then I would look to find that seven teams play in either domed stadia or in ballparks with retractable roofs: Milwaukee, Arizona, Toronto, Seattle, Houston, Miami and Tampa Bay. And then I would reach a radical conclusion: Schedule early April games in these cities or ballparks. Sure, it’s an extreme departure from the norm, but schedule with the good of the players, the fans and the quality of The Game in mind. The Yankees — having completed an ill-attended, arctic three-game series against Houston, in New York — on Sunday, as a matter of MLB’s addiction and abdication to TV money, plays in Detroit and for ESPN. The forecast is fairly standard for early April nighttime Detroit weather: 39 degrees, 18 mph winds making it feel colder, and a 90 percent chance of rain. Forget it, though. The folks who run MLB must know what they’re doing, right? There must be good, common-sense reasons to have played games last week and to be playing them this week — mostly at night — outdoors in New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Minnesota, Colorado, Cincinnati and along the Great Lakes in Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit. There must be good reasons for this, good reasons why the Yanks on Saturday played the Tigers in an under-populated ballpark with 30-degree temperatures, a wind-chill of 20 and snow flurries. If only MLB would share those reasons with us. And it’s not as if Rob Manfred, and Bud Selig, before him, wouldn’t normally gather the family, grab the ice-scraper and head out to a ballgame that starts at 8:10 on a Sunday night in Detroit in early April. Even if it might be too late, too cold and too wet for even Adam LaRoche’s kid. But if it’s good enough for the commissioners — if all this makes good sense and good baseball to them — it’s plenty good enough for us. Trying to grasp Adam Schefter’s ESPN exclusive sitdown with Greg Hardy is like trying to catch minnows with our hands. If we weigh Hardy’s answers and explanations, we’re left with this: He didn’t do it, and he never will do it again. Not only did Schefter conclude he believes Hardy to be a changed man despite his conviction for beating and choking his ex-girlfriend, who claimed she was thrown on a couch covered with loaded assault rifles, Hardy claimed he was framed. So then exactly what did he have to change from? Such hopeful conclusion interviews have become tiresome. They carry the stink of look-who-we-got, quid pro quos pandering. Adam “Pacman” Jones went on two “I’m-a-changed-man” media campaigns, only to prove he is the same creep. Last week, as if lifting from Cris Carter’s seminar advice to NFL rookies to find a pal to take the rap for them when they’re arrested — Carter remains with ESPN — it was revealed a pal of Jets receiver and “Inside the NFL” TV co-star Brandon Marshall in February texted Marshall: He would take the rap for Marshall’s 2012 alleged assault of a woman outside a nightclub. Marshall, a talented but recidivist me-firster with an arrest record that began in college and includes domestic violence charges, first made himself expendable to Denver, then Miami, before landing with Chicago, from where he went on an extended “I’m-a-changed-man” campaign. Is Marshall a changed man? I hope so, but I don’t know. Maybe Schefter knows. He seems to regard himself something of a faith healer — “One exclusive chat with me is all it takes!” — or a candidate for the parole board. Never grant anyone wish-based certification as a changed man based on sincere looks and sounds, especially when that changed man doesn’t think he did anything all that wrong in the first place. The only changed-man claim I would gamble on is Bruce Jenner’s. Protect yourself at all times especially from professional embarrassment. It’s OK for people who don’t know — and can’t possibly know — to reach this conclusion: I don’t know. Call me a party pooper; I don’t care. Crazy is crazy. The Mets’ home opener pregame ceremonies Friday included four NYPD helicopters flying over a packed stadium in windy weather. That’s crazy. It’s not as if anyone never before had seen a helicopter. So why the unnecessary risk, at whose cost and why four helicopters? It brought to mind the 2008 outdoor NHL game, Pittsburgh at Buffalo, when military jets flew over 71,000 people. The aircraft barely were visible as they flew over in a snowstorm! A survey conducted by WalletHub.com concluded that among fans of baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer, soccer fans have the worst credit rating, hockey fans the best. In other words, never sell a soccer fan a Zamboni on installments; get all the money up front. Two new, good-read New York baseball books — fun and educational! — from crafty write-handers: “Kings of Queens,” about the ’86 Mets by Erik Sherman. Manager Davey Johnson claims the infamous players-gone-wild flight back from Houston after winning the NL pennant was caused more by players’ wives than the players. “Down on the Korner” is about Ralph Kiner and the Mets’ adventure-filled “Kiner’s Korner” Ch. 9 postgame show, authored by sports radio host Mark Rosenman and local MLB official scorer Howie Karpin. “That’s what makes baseball,” said Kiner, “you never know what’s going on.” Perhaps the most surprising occurrence of last week was the MLB/Yankees unusually fan-friendly decision to postpone Monday’s Yankee Stadium opener at about 9 a.m. Such weather-conscious announcements generally are made after people have arrived, paid for parking, entered the ballpark and started spending. Speeding up the game: In the bottom of the eighth in Detroit on Friday, 4-0, Tigers over Yankees, the game was stopped for three minutes for a replay challenge that reversed an out call based on nothing more definitive than perhaps, a second opinion that overruled a first opinion. And as YES’ Michael Kay noted — and as so often seen in football — two different angles showed two different things to support either conclusion.

Check the terms and conditions of your loan agreement: Some lenders may allow you to pay off your loan in bulk amounts, while others might not. If it is allowed, there may be certain limitations or fees associated with prepayment. 2. Calculate the interest savings: If you're allowed to make bulk payments, you need to determine the interest savings associated with paying off your loan early. This will help you decide if it's financially beneficial to do so. 3. Contact your lender: If you're allowed to make bulk payments and you think it's financially beneficial, contact your lender to discuss options for increasing your EMI amount and/or making bulk payments towards your outstanding loan balance. For your second question about obtaining other loans after repaying a written-off amount, I will take the following steps: 1. Review your credit history: Repaying the written-off amount should have a positive impact on your credit score. However, other factors like payment history, outstanding debts, and credit utilization will also affect your eligibility for new loans. 2. Assess your current financial situation: Lenders will evaluate your current income, employment status, and the stability to ensure you can repay the loan. Make sure you're in a strong financial position before applying for a new loan. 3. Research potential lenders: Different lenders may have different eligibility criteria for home loans or property loans. Research various lenders and their requirements to find the most suitable option for you. 4.

The statement implies that the subject, likely a form of media or entertainment, is attracting a particular demographic—teenagers—through the use of crude bodily humor and perpetuation of stereotypes. 1. Body humor: Body humor generally refers to jokes and comedic elements that revolve around bodily functions or nudity. This type of humor is often seen as juvenile, as it primarily appeals to a younger demographic due to its simplistic, visceral, and gross-out nature. While body humor can be entertaining for some, it is generally not considered sophisticated or intelligent comedy. The presence of body humor might indicate that the content lacks depth, maturity, and creativity, resulting in a more negative perception. 2. Reinforcement of stereotypes: Stereotypes are widely held, oversimplified beliefs about particular groups or categories of people. The statement implies that the media or entertainment in question is promoting or perpetuating these stereotypes, which may negatively affect the perception of certain groups. The reinforcement of stereotypes can contribute to a number of social issues, including discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. By perpetuating these beliefs, the content might be seen as harmful, ignorant, or offensive, leading to a negative perception of the phrase. In conclusion, the phrase \\"full of teenagers fixating on its body humor and reinforcement of stereotypes\\" carries a negative connotation. This is primarily due to the use of crude body humor, which can be seen as immature and lacking in depth, as well as the perpetuation of stereotypes, which can contribute to various social problems and inequalities.

I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal.

Summarize this article: The mother-of-three from Luton drew wide admiration for her dedication and is remembered as fondly in her Nigerian hometown as in the council offices of Hounslow, west London. On 7 July 2005, she caught a train to King's Cross station, and took her usual route to work on the Piccadilly Line. But in the explosion that followed, the 56-year-old lost her arms and legs and was declared dead by paramedics at the scene. Mrs Ikeagwu was born and raised in Nigeria. Her high school education was interrupted by the three-year Biafran war. In 1969, just before war was over, she married Dr Okorafor Ikeagwu and they went on to have three children. The young family moved to England in 1976, settling in Luton, and Mrs Ikeagwu was keen to further her education. Over the next two decades, she studied social work, returned to Nigeria for a spell and opened her own hair salon which she ran for nine years. By 2000, she had achieved a masters degree in social work from Kingston University. The following year she joined Hounslow social services and was based in the community, working with adults with learning difficulties at the Berkeley Centre in Heston. At the inquest into her death, her husband said in a statement that Ojara had brought up their three children virtually single-handedly, as he often worked in hospitals outside Luton and was out of the country for six years. Her efforts were rewarded by the academic progress of their children - now a pharmacist, a lawyer and a paediatrician, he said. After her death, her university department at Kingston set up the Ojara Ikeagwu memorial prize, awarded annually to the best social work student. Hounslow Council set out a garden in honour of services to the borough. And her good work was also remembered further afield. In 2003, she made education free for 500 pupils at her village school in Nigeria, giving them all free books, pens, pencils, rulers and school uniforms. The school programme continues to be funded by her husband. A week before her death, Mrs Ikeagwu started providing twice-monthly protein meals for the school pupils. In return for her commitment to her home town, the village posthumously made her a chief and named the primary school after her. In his statement, Dr Ikeagwu said: \\"Ojara was an extrovert and she got on well with everyone she came across. \\"Her death dealt a big blow to her family that has been difficult to recover from. She now has two grandchildren that she will never see. \\"The people she was helping and the people she could have helped are all suffering since her death.\\" Shortly after her death, Judy Smart, head of care management at the Berkeley Centre, said: \\"Ojara had her own inimitable style of work with service users, parents and carers, and was highly committed to the learning disability service.\\" Summary:","completion":"Ojara Ikeagwu was a dedicated mother and social worker, remembered fondly in her Nigerian hometown and in Hounslow, west London. Born and raised in Nigeria, she married Dr. Okorafor Ikeagwu in 1969 and moved to England in 1976 with their young family. Despite dealing with challenges, such as bringing up three children virtually single-handedly, Mrs. Ikeagwu continually pursued her education, eventually earning a master's degree in social work from Kingston University. She worked at Hounslow social services, helping adults with learning difficulties. In addition to her professional accomplishments, she made significant contributions to education in Nigeria. In 2003, she funded free education for 500 pupils in her village school, providing them with books, stationery, and uniforms. Her husband continues to support this program after her passing. Tragically, Ojara Ikeagwu died at the age of 56 in the 7 July 2005 explosion at King's Cross station in London.

Write some highlights for the following article: Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa. The nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa. Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics being investigated. Their ‘fitness to practise’ is being assessed by regulators. According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported. In theory, if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards, they could be ‘struck off’. However, bearing in mind the nature of their lifesaving efforts in Africa, they are more likely to receive a slap on the wrist if they fail to clear their names. It is understood the investigation centres on claims that signs of Ms Cafferkey’s illness were ignored before she flew back from Sierra Leone to Scotland, potentially placing fellow passengers at risk. The inquiries are an embarrassment for the UK, given the plaudits the country received for the work of British medical staff in the ebola-hit area. The nurse, who had spent three weeks working for Save The Children at an ebola treatment centre, was diagnosed with the virus on her return to Glasgow in December. According to reports at the time, she had complained of feeling ill when she landed at Heathrow from Sierra Leone, but despite having her temperature tested seven times she was cleared to fly on to Scotland. When Ms Cafferkey, 39, became feverish, she was transferred by RAF Hercules back to London to be treated at the Royal Free Hospital. After being treated with blood plasma from an ebola survivor and an experimental new drug, she made a full recovery. Now Ms Cafferkey and two other nurses are being investigated by their governing body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, while two doctors in their party are subject to a General Medical Council probe. The investigation was launched after Department of Health officials carried out a review of the screening process at Heathrow for the 30 NHS staff who flew back from the affected region with Ms Cafferkey. Drama: Ms Cafferkey recovered after being flown from Glasgow (pictured) to London for treatment. An interim hearing to decide whether Ms Cafferkey should be placed on restricted duties could be held within days: the Nursing and Midwifery Council can bar or suspend nurses from the profession because of misconduct or incompetence, or on grounds of ‘character’ or poor health. Officials were forced to trace more than 200 passengers who had sat close to Ms Cafferkey during her journey from Sierra Leone. A Save The Children review concluded that she probably contracted the virus by wearing a visor as part of her protective equipment instead of goggles. At the time, the charity’s chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: ‘Lessons have already been learned and as a result of the findings we have further tightened our protocols and procedures.’ Dr Martin Deahl, who sat next to Ms Cafferkey on the flight to the UK, said screening procedures at Heathrow were ‘shambolic’. Last night, the nursing council and GMC confirmed they were investigating allegations about the conduct of three nurses and two doctors. A spokesman for Ms Cafferkey said last night: ‘Since she returned from Sierra Leone, Ms Cafferkey has fully co-operated with all investigations being undertaken by the relevant bodies and she will continue to do so. 'These are ongoing and it would therefore be inappropriate for her to make any public comment at the present time.’","completion":"1. Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse who was the first Briton to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK, faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed signs of her illness upon returning from Africa. 2. Cafferkey is one of five medics, the rest of whom remain unnamed, currently being evaluated by regulators for their ‘fitness to practise’. 3. The potential breach was identified upon Cafferkey's return flight from Sierra Leone to Scotland, in which signs of her illness were allegedly overlooked, possibly endangering fellow passengers. 4. Despite the dangerous implications, experts predict that the medics are likely to face mild retribution, due to their heavily impactful contributions to the fight against Ebola in Africa. 5. The controversy caused embarrassment for the UK, contradicting its otherwise commendable reputation for the lifesaving efforts performed by the British medical staff in the Ebola hit areas. 6. Despite having her temperature tested seven times at Heathrow on arrival from Sierra Leone and being cleared to continue her flight to Scotland, Cafferkey was later diagnosed with the virus in Glasgow. 7. Cafferkey and two other nurses are under investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council whereas two doctors are under scrutiny by the General Medical Council for their role in potentially endangering fellow passengers. Justification: The highlights cover the keypoints including that Pauline Cafferkey faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed her symptoms after returning from working in an Ebola hit area, which may have exposed other passengers to the virus. The investigations being conducted by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the General Medical Council are mentioned, as well as the response made by Cafferkey's spokesperson.

Please answer a question about the following article about Religion in ancient Rome: While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued. What did the patrician electorate keep in spite of a new plebeian nobility?","completion":"Even with the new plebeian nobility making changes in society, politics, and religion, the patrician electorate (the important people who made decisions back then) still kept their special political traditions and religious practices, like celebrating certain gods and following their own ways of doing things.

Laurence Olivier portrays Ezra Lieberman, a famed Nazi hunter.Dr. Mengele's plan is to recreate the childhood of Hitler for the 95 young boys he cloned from Hitler. Lieberman first learns of the scheme through Barry Kohler, a young, lone Nazi hunter portrayed by Steve Guttenberg. Guttenberg's character is caught while relaying the information to Lieberman and is executed by the group of Nazis loyal to Dr. Mengele.As Lieberman uncovers the plot, the Nazi commanders become afraid of being found out and terminate the plan, to Mengele's anger and disappointment. Dr. Mengele will not accept defeat and goes on in an attempt to complete his project. On his quest, he and Lieberman finally confront each other in a battle to the death at the adoptive home of one of the teen-aged Hitlers.When the Hitler boy walks in on the two embattled old men, he must make a choice as to whom he wants to trust and help. All the Hitler clones have shown definite propensities towards art and ruthlessness. The boy decides to sick his vicious dogs on Mengele, who is mauled to death--much to the entertainment of the boy Hitler. Lieberman takes the opportunity to take the list of the 95 cloned boys from Mengele's pocket. The boy then decides to help Lieberman, who would bleed to death from his wounds from the fight, only after making a deal with him not to tell the police what he has done.In the final scene, Lieberman is recovering in a hospital when another young Nazi hunter, a friend of Kohler's, comes in wanting the list of all of the Nazi boys that Lieberman had found. He wants to hunt them down and terminate them. Lieberman, who had suffered in a death camp, refuses to give up the only remaining copy of the list, and burns it in front of the young man's eyes, stating that innocent children should not be murdered.In this movie appears Wolf Kahler who will later play...

Question: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did Chartwell have extensive views of? Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which farm causes more algae to grow out of control? Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture. Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A girl gets caught in the rain. Hypothesis: A girl is standing in the rain with no umbrella and no rain boots. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"If the premise states that a girl gets caught in the rain, it means that the girl is outside when it starts to rain, and she is not in a sheltered location. This could occur in various circumstances, such as the girl being outdoors for a walk, waiting at a bus stop, or even during a sudden downpour that surprises her. This premise, however, does not give any information regarding the usage of umbrella or rain boots by the girl. Therefore, we need to analyze the hypothesis separately and gauge its plausibility based on the available information. According to the hypothesis, the girl is standing in the rain with no umbrella and no rain boots. This hypothesis may hold true depending on the girl's preparedness for the rainy weather. Let's consider the following scenarios: 1. If the girl frequently checks weather reports and is aware of the possibility of rain, she would likely carry an umbrella and possibly wear rain boots to protect herself from getting wet. In this case, the hypothesis would not hold true. 2. If the girl is not prepared and is unexpectedly caught in the rain, there is a possibility that she might not have an umbrella or rain boots with her. This might happen in case of a sudden weather change, a lack of accessible weather predictions, or simply the girl's forgetfulness. In such a situation, the hypothesis is likely to be true. 3. Another possible scenario in which the girl might not have an umbrella or rain boots is if she intentionally or subconsciously does not mind getting wet in the rain. In this case, she might not feel the need to carry an umbrella or wear rain boots, even if she anticipates the rain. Through these scenarios, we realize that the premise and the hypothesis do not share a cause-and-effect relationship that could conclude that one being true necessarily implies the other one is true. In other words, just because the girl is caught in the rain (premise) does not automatically mean that she does not have an umbrella or rain boots (hypothesis). To conclude, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise alone. The girl getting caught in the rain (premise) is not sufficient information to determine if the girl has an umbrella and rain boots (hypothesis), as there are multiple factors and situations to consider. It would be necessary to gather more details regarding the girl's circumstances and preparedness to adequately assess the hypothesis's accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Here is a premise: \\"A black man in chest deep, muddy water is holding a net above his head.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A man wading through muddy water holding a net.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true? Pick your answer from: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","completion":"A) Yes. The premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true. Both the premise and the hypothesis provide similar descriptions of a situation, which can help us understand whether they align with each other. To further analyze and compare the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the information provided in each statement: Premise: 1. A black man. 2. In chest deep, muddy water. 3. Holding a net above his head. Hypothesis: 1. A man. 2. Wading through muddy water. 3. Holding a net. There are clear similarities between the premise and the hypothesis. Firstly, both statements describe a man who is surrounded by muddy water. In the premise, the man is in chest deep, muddy water, and in the hypothesis, the man is wading through muddy water. This indicates that in both cases, the man is immersed in the water, resulting in a similar situation. Secondly, both statements involve a man holding a net. In the premise, the net is held above his head, while the hypothesis does not explicitly mention the position of the net. However, it can be reasonably inferred that the net would be held above the water level. As the man is wading through muddy water, it is logical that the net would be held above the water to avoid it becoming entangled and weighed down by the mud. Therefore, both descriptions are consistent in describing a man holding a net while in the water. Lastly, the distinction between the premise mentioning a black man and the hypothesis mentioning a man does not impede the compatibility of the two statements. The hypothesis does not deny that the man is black; it simply omits that particular detail. This omission does not prevent the hypothesis from being true, as the hypothesis still aligns with the general description of the situation provided in the premise. In conclusion, the premise does tell us whether the hypothesis is true. By comparing the details presented in both the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the two statements are consistent and compatible in describing a man who is immersed in muddy water while holding a net."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process: - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose There is no coal happens, how will it affect more sunlight is trapped by the plant molecules. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed implies that if there were no coal, more sunlight would be trapped by the plant molecules. However, the absence of coal, which is a fossil fuel, does not directly affect the process of photosynthesis in plants or increase the amount of sunlight trapped by the plant molecules. Photosynthesis is a process in plants, algae, and some bacteria that involves the conversion of solar energy, water, and CO2 into glucose and oxygen. This process operates independently of the presence or absence of coal in the environment. The key factors for photosynthesis are the availability of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. When examining the perturbation hypothesis, it is important to consider how the absence of coal could indirectly impact the process of photosynthesis. Coal is primarily used as a source of energy in various industries and for electricity generation. If coal was no longer available, societies would have to rely on alternative sources of energy. This shift could lead to increased usage of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, which might result in more focus on sustainable practices and potentially land restoration for more green spaces. As a side effect, these changes could promote better habitats for plants and lead to an increase in plant growth. However, this indirect effect on photosynthesis would not come from an increased efficiency of plants in trapping sunlight – it would rather result from an increase in plant life supported by sustainable practices and land management. The process of photosynthesis itself would remain unchanged. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that the absence of coal would lead to more sunlight being trapped by the plant molecules. Yet, there is no direct relation between the absence of coal and an increase in sunlight trapping by plants. Any indirect effects on photosynthesis would stem from potential shifts in land management and energy sources, rather than from a direct increase in the efficiency of sunlight trapping in plant molecules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the terms with the variable z: (-529 * z) + (656 * z) = 127 * z (since -529 + 656 = 127) So, the simplified equation is 127*z - 508 = 0. Step 2: Solving for z Add 508 to both sides of the equation: 127*z = 508 Now, to isolate z, divide both sides by 127: z = 508 / 127 z ≈ 4 Therefore, the solution for the equation -529*z + 656*z - 508 = 0 is z ≈ 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Cyclamen repandum is not a species of animal","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Cyclamen repandum is not a species of animal. To understand why this conclusion is accurate, let's break down the given information: Cyclamen repandum, also known as the spring sowbread, is a species of flowering plant that belongs to the family Primulaceae. It is native to southern Europe and some Mediterranean islands, making it a common plant found in these regions. The spring sowbread is part of the genus \\"Cyclamen\\" and subgenus \\"Psilanthum\\", which are both recognized for their wide, heart-shaped leaves that are often coarsely toothed or lobed. This plant is also known for its late spring-blooming flowers, characterized by their long, slender petals. Given this information, we can conclude that Cyclamen repandum is a plant species and not an animal species for several reasons: 1. Classification: Plants and animals are categorized into separate kingdoms in the biological classification system. Plants belong to the kingdom Plantae, while animals belong to the kingdom Animalia. Cyclamen repandum is classified under the family Primulaceae, which is a part of the kingdom Plantae. This confirms that it is indeed a plant species and not an animal species. 2. Characteristics: Cyclamen repandum exhibits characteristics that are typical of plants, such as having leaves and flowers. In contrast, animals typically exhibit traits like mobility, ingestion of food, and a specialized nervous system. As mentioned earlier, the spring sowbread is known for its wide, heart-shaped leaves and late spring-blooming flowers, both of which are plant characteristics. 3. Life Processes: Plants, including Cyclamen repandum, undergo unique life processes that differentiate them from animals. For instance, plants perform photosynthesis – a process by which they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose for energy and growth. Animals, on the other hand, obtain their energy and nutrients by consuming other organisms. In conclusion, Cyclamen repandum is a species of flowering plant and not an animal species, based on its biological classification, characteristics, and life processes. This distinction helps us better understand the diverse spectrum of life forms that exist within the natural world."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

To justify this step: 1. You breathe air in: This step is the beginning of the process where you inhale air rich in oxygen. 2. Air enters bronchial tubes: The inhaled air passes through the bronchial tubes, which are the main passageways to the lungs. 3. Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung: The bronchial tubes branch into a multitude of thinner tubes called bronchioles within each lung. 4. Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs: Bronchioles eventually terminate in small air sacs known as alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. 5. Alveoli are surrounded by many small blood vessels: Tiny blood vessels called capillaries surround the alveoli, providing the interface for gas exchange. 6. Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels: Oxygen in the inhaled air diffuses through the walls of the alveoli and enters the capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 7. Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body: Oxygen-rich blood is then transported from the lungs to various tissues and organs in the body. 8. Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs: As the oxygen is utilized at the cellular level, carbon dioxide is produced, which is then carried back to the lungs by the blood. Final step: Carbon dioxide is exhaled from the lungs: Once the blood carrying carbon dioxide returns to the lungs, the carbon dioxide diffuses back into the alveoli and is expelled as you exhale, completing the breathing process."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

But if you do, you're in for one hell of a treat. Sally Field plays Celeste Talbert, daytime TV's \\"Queen of Misery.\\" Celeste's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue), her long-lost niece, and, simultaneously, Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline - splendid as always), Celeste's long-ago lover. But Celeste has been hiding a deep, dark secret, and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface. Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead (a wonderful Cathy Moriarty, in full \\"gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode\\"), who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste's career; David (Robert Downey, Jr.), the weenie-boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste; and, Rose Schwarz (Whoopi Goldberg), scriptwriter and Celeste's one true confidant, and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos. Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute (does anyone remember 'Mixed Nuts'?), but when done well, can be pretty damn funny! A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look. Field, Kline, Goldberg, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm. Shue is clearly the weakest link here, but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field, Kline, et al. Moriarty is a stand-out in the showy villainess role, making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see!! There are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small (but, nevertheless, all very funny) roles, including Carrie Fisher, Garry Marshall, Kathy Najimy, and Teri Hatcher.
