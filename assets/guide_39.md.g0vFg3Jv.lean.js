The pièce de résistance was the fig, goat cheese, and honey variant that sent my taste buds into overdrive with an impeccable mix of sweet and savory flavors. Time for the main course - I opted for the Root Vegetable Risotto, which left me speechless with its creamy texture and succulent flavors. The combination of earthy beets, carrots, and parsnips blended harmoniously with the creamy Arborio rice, elevated by the rich flavors of the Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Johan van Banchem, a Dutch citizen, was indeed one of the key figures involved in the brutal lynching of the De Witt brothers, Johan de Witt and Cornelis de Witt, on August 20, 1672. The brothers were prominent Dutch politicians, with Johan serving as the Grand Pensionary of the Dutch Republic (1653-1672) and Cornelis being a prominent military leader. The events leading up to their lynching were a result of political turmoil. The De Witt brothers were strong advocates of the Republican cause in the Dutch Republic and opposed the monarchical ambitions of the Orangist party, who wanted Prince William III of Orange to hold a higher role in the government. Tensions between the two groups escalated during the rampjaar or \\"disaster year\\" of 1672 when the Dutch Republic was invaded by France and its allies, leading to military defeats and economic hardship. The Orangists blamed the De Witts for the crisis, accusing them of betraying the Dutch Republic to the French and inciting public unrest. On June 21, 1672, Johan de Witt was severely wounded in an assassination attempt, and his brother Cornelis was later arrested on charges of treason. Both brothers were held captive in the Gevangenpoort prison in The Hague. On August 20, 1672, a mob led by Johan van Banchem and other Orangist supporters stormed the Gevangenpoort prison, dragged out the De Witt brothers, and brutally lynched them in the streets of The Hague. Van Banchem played an active part in the act and his involvement was well-known. As a direct result of his actions, he was rewarded by Prince William III of Orange, who ascended to the office of Stadtholder in 1672 as a result of the political crisis generated by the Orangist coup. Prince William recognized Van Banchem's role in the lynching and the removal of the De Witt brothers from power as a significant contribution to the Orangist cause. To reward Van Banchem for his role in these events, Prince William appointed him as the baljuw (steward or bailiff) of The Hague. The baljuw was a medieval official responsible for overseeing law enforcement, public order, and the administration of justice within his jurisdiction. In the case of The Hague, this meant that Van Banchem was given substantial responsibility for ensuring the safety and stability of the city. In becoming the baljuw of The Hague, Johan van Banchem thus received a considerable promotion and recognition from the new Stadtholder, William III, for his part in facilitating the rise of the Orangist party and securing their political influence in the Dutch Republic."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

A person is still infectious for the first 48 hours after beginning their course of antibiotics. Take care to avoid infectious contact with other people during this time. Do this after the first couple days of antibiotics, but before you finish your antibiotics. Otherwise, your old toothbrush could become a carrier and re-infect you once the antibiotics are done. When possible avoid contact with people with strep throat, especially during the contagious period (up to 48 hours after starting treatment). If a family member has strep throat, don't share glasses or utensils. Proper hand washing is the best way to prevent all kinds of infections. According to the CDC proper hand washing technique includes: Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap.

R.E.M. was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—\\"Radio Free Europe\\"—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single \\"The One I Love\\". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history.

For example, you may notice a co-worker drinking extra at a company party. You may see them filling up their drink when no one else is at the bar, or even notice them carrying a flask. You may also notice you don't see one co-worker eat at lunch, but sometimes find evidence of food having been in their office. They may be very secretive about eating habits, and habitually turn down offers to get food with co-workers. Pathological liars are often disconnected with reality. A lot of times, they may believe parts of their lies themselves. They may be deluded about themselves and their abilities. A pathological liar may have a tendency to exaggerate their importance. They may see something innocuous, like a compliment from a boss, as a sign of personal greatness. When recounting the compliment, they may fluff its importance. A pathological liar may lack basic life skills, but may not see this as a problem. If the person has a distorted view of reality, they may honestly believe what they are saying. While this is not true of all pathological liars, consider the possibility that the person is not lying out of malice. Pathological liars tend to have unstable relationships. Consider anything you know about this person's relationship history. Look for any warning signs of instability. Does this person have stable friendships or romantic relationships? A lack of longterm friends, and a series of failed romances, may indicate a pathological liar. A pathological liar may also be estranged from their family. A pathological liar tends to bluff their way into jobs. A pathological liar may have many jobs on their resume. However, most of these jobs will be short term. They may also dodge questions about why certain jobs did not work out longterm. For example, a pathological liar may have a long resume. Most of the jobs will only have been short term. If you ask the pathological liar about their career, they may dodge questions. In some cases, a pathological liar may have moved around a lot due to sudden career changes. Pathological liars often burn bridges with employers. Summary:","completion":"Someone who lies a lot might also have trouble with other bad habits like drinking too much or eating too much.

In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Sir Stephen House, 57, said the time was right to take up new challenges after 35 years as a police officer. He has been under severe pressure over the three days it took his officers to respond to a fatal crash on the M9. He has also been criticised over armed officers being put on routine patrol and his force's policies on stopping and searching juveniles. Sir Stephen had previously indicated he was likely to stand down when his four-year contract expired in September of next year. Confirming the details of his departure at a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) in Stirling, he outlined some of the successes of Police Scotland, including the new national approach to domestic abuse and sexual attack. He added: \\"As the leader of a national organisation that provides a vital public service 24 hours every day of the year, there can never be a convenient time to move on, but after nearly 35 years as a police officer and the last nine as a chief constable in Scotland, I believe the time is right for me to take up a new challenge and thereby allow the process to recruit my successor to begin. \\"Much has been achieved since the creation of Police Scotland and I firmly believe that Scotland is better served for it. Not only in managing the changes brought about by reform and substantial financial cuts, but most importantly in the public service we provide.\\" He acknowledged: \\"There remains a lot to do, but knowing as I do the quality of our officers and staff, I am confident that the challenges will be met. \\"The dedication and commitment of our people is truly outstanding and I know will serve Scotland well in the future under a new chief constable.\\" Paying tribute to the chief constable, SPA chairman Vic Emery said he firmly believed that Sir Stephen had been \\"the right individual at the right time\\" to lead Police Scotland through the \\"combined challenges of major reorganisation, fundamental reform, and reduced funding\\". He added: \\"Sometimes the public don't always see the real person behind the public profile. Steve has always been a constable first, and a chief officer second.\\" Sir Stephen, who was previously the chief constable of Strathclyde Police, oversaw the complex amalgamation in 2013 of Scotland's eight regional police forces into the single national force, which is the second largest in the UK. Since then, he has overseen successes such as the policing of last year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But he was criticised over his decision to allow armed officers to attend routine incidents, as well as the force's policy on stopping and searching juveniles. The force is also under pressure over its response to the M9 crash in July in which John Yuill and his partner Lamara Bell died after it took three days for officers to respond to reports of their car leaving the road near Stirling. When Sir Stephen House was appointed the first chief constable of the new Police Service of Scotland he was credited with being the best candidate because of his \\"impressive track record of leadership, partnership working and delivery\\". Those were the words of the then Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who believed Sir Stephen would make \\"an outstanding\\" chief constable. Before the 57-year-old took on the role in October 2012 - seven months before Police Scotland came into being - he already had an impressive CV of public service both north and south of the border. Sir Stephen's police career began 34 years ago when he joined Sussex Police. He was a uniform officer between 1981 and 1988, initially working for Sussex and then later transferring to Northamptonshire Police followed by West Yorkshire Police. Sir Stephen's first taste of high command came in 1998 when he joined Staffordshire Police as an assistant chief constable, initially in territorial policing and later in crime and operations. After three years in that job he joined the Metropolitan Police Service as a deputy assistant commissioner. Despite what he described as his \\"estuary English\\" accent, Sir Stephen is Scottish, having been born in Glasgow. Read more here Police Scotland officers are being investigated by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner over the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in police custody after being arrested following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May. And there have also been reports that Police Scotland was one of two unnamed UK forces accused by a watchdog of spying on journalists and their sources. Sir Stephen had faced calls to resign from opposition politicians in the wake of the controversies, but Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has always insisted she had full confidence in him. Responding to his announcement, Ms Sturgeon thanked Sir Stephen for his \\"years of dedicated service\\" with both Strathclyde Police and Police Scotland. She said: \\"Strong policing has ensured recorded crime is at a 40-year low. Sir Stephen provided leadership at a crucial time and his strong focus on tackling violent crime made a major contribution to that achievement. \\"Reform of policing in Scotland was absolutely vital to sustain the policing upon which Scotland's communities depend and Sir Stephen's contribution to that was invaluable.\\" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who has been a fierce critic of the single force, said Sir Stephen's departure would not by itself solve the \\"deep-rooted problems\\" in Police Scotland and that the force needed a \\"fresh start\\". He added: \\"Ultimately the SNP government must accept responsibility for this chaos. They rammed through the centralisation of our police service despite warnings. They set up the toothless Scottish Police Authority. They appointed the chief constable.\\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Sir Stephen was \\"bowing to the inevitable\\" by resigning, and said it was \\"essential that his replacement is up to the task of tackling the problems that have afflicted the single force since its inception\\". Scottish Labour's justice spokesman, Graeme Pearson - who was formerly a senior police officer - said the process of reforming Police Scotland \\"can begin now if the SNP government are willing to take responsibility for their mistakes\\". But the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said Sir Stephen had made a \\"monumental contribution\\" to policing. The federation's chairman, Brian Docherty, said: \\"He has delivered the most significant public sector restructuring in a generation against a background of a brutal austerity agenda. \\"He has delivered some very impressive policing results on crimes of violence, particularly domestic violence. I have little doubt that history will prove to be kinder to Sir Stephen than the current commentary which at times has been vindictive and deeply personal. \\"Many people feared that a single police service could be susceptible to political interference and those who have called for the head of the chief constable as some form of trophy need to consider that.\\" Niven Rennie, president of the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, said on Twitter that the first chief constable of Police Scotland \\"was always going to be on a hiding to nothing\\". He also said that critics of the force should \\"recognise the great achievements of Police Scotland in its formative years not concentrate on the mistakes.\\" Mr Rennie said Sir Stephen's decision would give the force a chance to rebuild on a \\"crazy\\" two years, and that he believed a \\"change in style will help\\". Martin Bell, the brother of M9 crash victim Lamara Bell, said: \\"It's over to the government now to see what changes they will bring in. \\"We have no faith in Police Scotland at all and no faith that we will see real change as a result of Sir Stephen standing down. \\"What happened to Lamara really can't happen again. They need to stop making cuts to emergency services and put as much funding into them as they possibly can.\\"","completion":"Police Scotland's Chief Constable, Sir Stephen House, is to stand down earlier than expected, following controversy over his force's recent handling of several high-profile cases, such as an armed police incident and the slow response to a fatal road crash."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tampa Bay Lightning at Toronto Maple Leafs game preview Expectations in hockey-mad Toronto appear to be taking their toll on the Maple Leafs, whose coach is aware of both the issue of his job security and the tension surrounding his struggling team. Randy Carlyle's club has lost three straight heading into Thursday night's home matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and he's aware that improvement needs to come quickly. A 9-2 home loss to Nashville on Tuesday had Carlyle on the defensive the next day, as he often appeared agitated during his post-practice news conference. \\"You're always in a position of doubt when things go awry with your hockey club. When you take these jobs, you can expect that,\\" he said. \\"In this market it's a little bit more intense at times, just by the number of (media) that are here today. We have some faces that we haven't (seen) all year, and it's very similar to last night, that it seems that negativity brings a lot more people out to ask the questions, and rightfully so.\\" Toronto (9-8-2) hadn't allowed nine goals since a 12-1 loss to Pittsburgh on Dec. 26, 1991. It's been outscored 17-5 during its losing streak, including a 6-2 loss to lowly Buffalo on Saturday. Carlyle also spoke about his beleaguered players \\"squeezing the stick\\" in practice Wednesday. \\"Honestly, we've got to quiet the noise,\\" defenseman Cody Franson said. \\"We are feeling a lot of pressure right now and it's tough not to feel that and just focus on hockey. I think we're in a situation where everyone is feeling the heat.\\" The Leafs went 6-1-1 in their eight games before their skid, during which they've lost twice at home following a four-game winning streak at Air Canada Centre. \\"When you get beat like that in professional sports it is embarrassing, and when you get beat like that in front of your home fans it compounds things,\\" captain Dion Phaneuf said. \\"It is unacceptable.\\" They'll look to bounce back against a Lightning team coming off a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Tampa Bay (13-5-2) had won its previous two but looked sluggish late in second of a back-to-back set. Alex Killorn and Ondrej Palat scored for the Lightning, which lost center Cedric Paquette in the first period to a lower-body injury. The status of Paquette, who had five goals in his previous six games, is unclear. \\"That's a tough one for us,\\" coach Jon Cooper said. \\"We gave them six power plays. We lost a forward, so we're playing 50 minutes in a back-to-back with 11 forwards.\\" The Lightning could get a boost from the return of winger Brett Connolly, who has missed the last 12 with a leg injury. He said he's hoping to \\"sneak into the lineup\\" against Toronto, but Cooper has given no indication if Connolly will play. Ben Bishop should be back in goal after Evgeni Nabokov made 31 saves against the Islanders. Bishop is 8-1-1 in his last 10 starts and has a 1.72 goals-against average in his past four. It's uncertain who the Leafs will go with in net after Tuesday's disastrous performance. Jonathan Bernier was pulled before the second period after allowing three goals on 12 shots, and James Reimer gave up six for the second straight game after taking the loss against the Sabres. \\"We need a better performance from everybody,\\" Carlyle said. \\"Goaltending is part of that.\\" Tampa Bay has won the last two meetings. Steven Stamkos had a hat trick in a 5-3 victory March 19 - giving him four goals and two assists in his last three against the Leafs - before Palat scored twice in a 3-0 win April 8. Summary:","completion":"The Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team is feeling pressure because they have lost three games in a row. Their coach, Randy Carlyle, is aware that people might want him to lose his job because of the team's struggles. They will be playing against the Tampa Bay Lightning, and they hope to do better in this game. The players and coach think they need to focus on playing well and ignore the negativity around them."},{"prompt":"Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - suppose more air sacs filled happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.

Question: Who was Shazam's champion 5000 years before? Movie plot title: Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam Movie plot: The film opens with a young couple overlooking the city from a hillside as an apparent meteor streaks across the sky, and into the Earth. It smashes into the couple's car, with them still in it, on a hillside beside the lookout over Fawcett City. It's revealed that that meteor is in fact Black Adam returning to Earth from his long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a seemingly rundown slum with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan t-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to his kitchen to find food, but only finds potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to rendezvous with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees three bullies robbing a homeless man. After attempting to defend the homeless man, Billy himself earns a black eye for his trouble. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, and calls him \\"The Captain\\". Billy responds by telling him he always try to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only currency he has - a subway token. On arriving at the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfast specials, and tells him his intended story will bring the plight of him and those in his situation to public light. Billy tears into his plates ravenously. He tells Mr. Kent that he tries to be good no matter what. As the conversation continues, neither notice that Black Adam has appeared, hovering above the ground outside the diner and causes a destructive force by clapping his hands together and blowing a hole in the side of the diner. Clark attempts to protect the boy, but a blow from Black Adam sends him through several walls. He emerges from beneath the rubble and transforms himself into Superman. Adam stalks young Billy through the streets stating his surprise over the Wizard's choice to become the next Marvel, but Billy is completely unaware of what he means. Black Adam picks up a passing fire engine, but Superman appears and intervenes before Black Adam can use it to crush him. Billy then makes good his escape. Superman...","completion":"The movie plot provided for \\"Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam\\" does not offer specific information regarding who Shazam's champion was 5000 years prior to the events of the film. The plot primarily focuses on the character of Billy Batson, a young boy who is seen living in impoverished conditions and encounters Clark Kent, who later transforms into Superman when Black Adam makes an appearance. Black Adam refers to Billy as the Wizard's next choice, indicating that he may take on the role of Shazam's champion, but the plot doesn't discuss the history or past champions of Shazam. In the wider DC Comics lore, Black Adam himself was a previous champion of the wizard Shazam, from about 5000 years before the present day in many storylines.

Kenneth was very talented and auditioned for the part in the play unlike Brian, therefore Select from: (I). Kenneth got the part.. (II). Brian got the part..","completion":"(I). Kenneth got the part. Kenneth's talent was truly commendable. He had this effortless way of immersing himself into a character that made the world around him fade into the background. Believe it or not, Kenneth had been honing this craft from a very young age. He was born and raised in a family of actors. His father had been a local theatre artist and his mother, a former Broadway actress. So, it was safe to say that the performing arts had been a large part of his life ever since the beginning. His parents used to say that Kenneth started mimicking characters when he was barely able to walk. Kenneth never showed an interest in anything other than acting. He was happiest when he was on stage, floating effortlessly between realities and creating a universe that belonged to him and his audience alone. His propensity for conveying emotions convincingly was the staple of his performances. From the slight furrowing of his brows showing confusion or worry to the way his eyes twinkled with mischief or joy, every detail was artfully expressed. Auditioning for the play was just another day for him. Not because he did not respect the process or was too arrogant to acknowledge the hard work it took, but because the process felt so organic and deeply rooted in his life's rhythm that he lived for such moments. The part was for the lead role of a melancholic poet in a tragic story. A character that required an understanding of the human mind's depths and the ability to translate into cathartic performances. Unlike Kenneth, Brian was relatively new to the acting world. He had just started dabbling into community theatre and was still exploring his comfort zone on stage. Though he had a certain appeal to his acting talent, Brian needed time to grow and develop. He was also auditioning for the same role, clouded with uncertainty because of his inexperience. After his audition, Kenneth could see some definite potential in Brian, but he knew the part needed an actor with the panache to evoke strong emotions, much more than what Brian was capable of at his current stage. Brian's performance was decent but lacked the depth that the character required. On the day of the result, unsurprisingly, Kenneth's name echoed through the auditorium. He had successfully bagged the role of the melancholic poet. His talent, experience, and skill had won him the part. Though it was a victory, Kenneth felt a pang of sympathy for Brian, for he saw a younger version of his own in Brian, trying to battle through the daunting world of acting.

This would help the government give money to help businesses grow (private investment) while still saving.

(CNN) -- Centuries from Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli helped India defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one-day international in Kolkata to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Upul Tharanga had hit a superb 118 and Kumar Sangakkara made a fine 60 as the visitors reached an imposing 315 for six after choosing to bat first. However, Gambhir struck an undefeated 150 and Kohli made 107 -- his maiden century -- the two adding 224 for the third wicket as India easily overhauled the target, the highest one-day run chase at the famous Eden Gardens ground. After the tourists opted to bat, India began well with the ball, conceding a measly nine from five immaculate overs sent down by new-ball bowlers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. But Tillakaratne Dilshan broke the shackles by driving Nehra through the covers in the sixth over for the first boundary and from then on India gradually lost control. Nehra, who had dropped Tharanga on seven when he failed to hold on to a fairly straightforward return catch, went some way to atoning for that error by snaring Dilshan early and Sanath Jayasuriya, batting at three, also departed cheaply. But then Sangakkara, who was handed a reprieve before he was even off the mark when Harbhajan Singh squandered a simple chance at third man, and Tharanga built a solid base.

Buffalo Springfield was a Canadian-American rock band active from 1966 to 1968 whose most prominent members were Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay. The band released three albums and several singles, including \\"For What It's Worth\\". The band combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion and psychedelic-rock influences, and, along with the Byrds, were part of the early development of folk-rock. With a name taken from a brand of steamroller, Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). Neil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with The Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd. In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews--James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James--was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL. With their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer headed for Los Angeles, where they encountered Stills. Drummer Dewey Martin, who had played with garage rock group the Standells and country artists such as Patsy Cline and the Dillards, joined at the suggestion of the Byrds' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at The Troubadour in Hollywood. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for the Dillards and the Byrds. Entity:","completion":"Buffalo Springfield"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vaikka en voi kommentoida suoraan kaupallisten vakuutusten saatavuutta, voin kuitenkin tarjota joitain perustietoja vakuutusmarkkinoista ja siitä, miten ne tyypillisesti toimivat Suomessa. Suomessa on useita vakuutusyhtiöitä, jotka tarjoavat monenlaisia vakuutuspalveluita sekä kuluttajille että yrityksille. Kaupallisiin tarkoituksiin suunnatut vakuutukset kattavat monenlaisia riskejä ja niiden tarkoituksena on suojata yrityksiä ja niiden omistajia mahdollisilta taloudellisilta menetyksiltä ja haitoilta. Näihin vakuutuksiin voi sisältyä esimerkiksi yrityksen omaisuuden vakuutus, liiketoimintakatkosvakuutus, vastuuvakuutus ja työntekijöiden sairaus- ja tapaturmavakuutus. Suomessa vakuutusmarkkinat ovat melko kilpailukykyiset, joten yrityksillä on yleensä hyvät mahdollisuudet löytää sopiva vakuutusratkaisu tarpeisiinsa. Vakuutusten hintaan ja saatavuuteen vaikuttavat kuitenkin monet tekijät, kuten yrityksen toimiala, sen koko, riskitaso ja vakuutuksen kattavuus. Jos olet kiinnostunut hankkimaan kaupallisen vakuutuksen, suosittelen kääntymään paikallisen vakuutusasiantuntijan puoleen, joka voi auttaa sinua arvioimaan yrityksesi vakuutustarpeet ja löytämään sopivan vakuutusratkaisun. Voit myös tutustua eri vakuutusyhtiöiden tarjontaan verkossa ja pyytää tarjouksia vertaillaksesi eri vaihtoehtoja. Lopuksi on tärkeää muistaa, että vakuutusten ehdot ja hinnat voivat vaihdella yhtiöittäin, joten on hyvä käyttää aikaa eri vaihtoehtojen tutkimiseen ja vertailuun.

The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems. The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other.

Fran is likely experiencing a bad hair day and feels that their appearance looks horrible, which causes them to struggle with confidence and self-esteem. This emphasizes the role appearances often play in young people's lives and how they perceive themselves, which can directly impact their willingness to engage in social activities like attending school. In response, Mom tries to downplay the issue and comfort Fran with practical advice to tie their hair up or find alternative solutions instead of giving into their insecurities. Mom is encouraging Fran not to let a bad hair day dictate their decisions, and she tries to put it into perspective by explaining that everyone experiences such days occasionally. At the end of the conversation, Fran expresses self-loathing, indicating an underlying deeper issue with self-esteem or self-image, which might not be just rooted in their hair but can stem from several factors, such as peer pressure or an innate desire to fit in with their peers. Amidst this situation, Mom tries to reassure and calm Fran down, using a light-hearted comment and reminding them that bad hair days are an ordinary part of life.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who accidentally puts the diaper on while the baby crawls off? Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with","completion":"The phrase \\"disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with\\" would be generally considered negative due to the language used and the context around the concept. To analyze the phrase in-depth, let's break it down into its components: 1. \\"Disguised\\" implies that something is being intentionally hidden or misrepresented. This term carries a negative connotation, as it suggests deceit or dishonesty. 2. \\"War tribute\\" alludes to an act or symbol meant to honor the sacrifices and achievements of those involved in warfare. Depending on the context and the listener's perspective, a war tribute could be seen as either positive or negative. Some people see these tributes as a form of respect and expression of gratitude for those who have served their country. On the other hand, others might argue that war tributes glorify conflict, violence, and its consequential suffering – leading to a more negative perception. 3. \\"Disgusting\\" is an inherently negative word. By definition, it conveys feelings of strong disapproval, revulsion, or distaste. 4. \\"To begin with\\" indicates that the speaker's strong negative reaction to the situation is their initial response, and it is likely that additional negative aspects or implications might be revealed. When you put these components together, the phrase suggests that something is being deceitfully presented as a war tribute, and this deceit is seen as repulsive or distasteful. The use of the word \\"disgusting\\" is a clear indicator of negative sentiment. Additionally, the purposeful act of hiding something or presenting it falsely adds to the negative impression.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control. The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics. Currently, The Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet). The band's sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music. Several conflicts would lead Parfitt to leave the band in early 1994. John Hill, a former bandmate of McIntyre's, would join the band as a rhythm guitarist while Schneider began to grow more comfortable playing lead guitar. It was also at this time that Schneider began to take stronger creative control of the band, shifting its sound from its stronger rock qualities to a spacier pop sound. The band started work on a debut full-length album, but it instead became Hypnotic Suggestion, a second EP. However, after SpinART Records offered to buy the band an 8-track in return for an album, new plans for an LP arose. In mid-1994, after Hypnotic Suggestion, McIntyre would be the second to leave the band, due to a number of personal distresses as well as stylistic changes that arose with Parfitt's departure. Having great difficulty finding a new permanent bassist, the band would rotate a number of frequent bass contributors, including Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel, Kurt Heasley of The Lilys, Kyle Jones, Joel Richardson, and Joel Evans. Jim McIntyre would also occasionally guest on bass. This continued to be the makeup of the band as they toured the country in late 1994, recording the first half of their new album in Glendora, California. In early 1995, the band finished the album, Fun Trick Noisemaker, at Kyle Jones's house (the birthplace of Schneider's Pet Sounds Studio). Now with a full-length LP to support, the band began touring again. Eric Allen, whom the band had previously auditioned as a guitarist after the departure of Chris Parfitt, joined the band as a much welcomed permanent bassist. Late 1995, Schneider relocated Pet Sounds Studio to Jim McIntyre's house. McIntyre continued to be involved in the recording and engineering of the band's albums until the mid-2000s. A significantly different band from the original 1992 four-piece, the official name of the band gradually became \\"The Apples in Stereo\\", with the \\"in stereo\\" usually somewhat under-emphasized, whether in lower-case or in parentheses. Schneider described this in an interview: \\"It's very clearcut, actually: we're The Apples, the music's in stereo. It's not actually the band name - it's a step back from it, a band name once removed. We're The Apples, in stereo. Kind of like a TV show, 'in stereo!' That always seemed to be a really big deal, that it was in stereo.\\" McIntyre later remarked, \\"It's cool the name changed cause the Apples and the Apples in Stereo were really two different entities.\\" What year did the band start?","completion":"The band started in 1992. Just think, it's like a group of friends who started making music together a long, long time ago, even before you were born!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Although the reviewer initially had a positive experience, they seem to currently find the product or service more frustrating and inadequate when it comes to backing up and restoring texts, which is likely an important feature for users. A breakdown of the rating is as follows: 1. The reviewer starts with a positive comment: \\"Earlier day it works good.\\" This indicates that initially, they had a satisfactory experience, which could have earned a rating between 4 and 5. 2. However, they then express dissatisfaction with the current performance: \\"Now, it's annoying.\\" Annoyance implies that the product or service does not meet their expectations or has lost its value, pushing the rating to a 2 or lower. 3. The reviewer mentions two key issues: \\"Cannot backup all texts cannot restore too.\\" These issues are significant for the user and further contribute to the low rating. The specificity of the problems indicates that these features are crucial to their experience, and the current shortcomings affect their overall perception. 4. The reviewer does not mention any redeeming qualities or potential improvements to balance their negative feedback. This absence points towards an unfavorable view of the product or service and reinforces a rating of 2 out of 5. In summary, based on the user's initial satisfaction and their subsequent disappointment in the product or service, I would give this review a 2 out of 5. While it's not the worst rating (1), it shows that there are critical issues that negatively impact the user's experience. This rating suggests that the developer or provider needs to address the mentioned concerns for better customer satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Plan Your Meals Plan your meals for the entire week to avoid impulse buying and to ensure that you have a clear list of ingredients required. Meal planning can also help cut costs by repurposing leftovers and reducing food waste. Step 4: Shop at Discount Grocery Stores and Buy in Bulk Find local discount grocery stores and farmer's markets, which often offer lower prices on produce and other items. Purchasing food in bulk may be more cost-effective in the long run, especially for non-perishable items. Step 5: Use Coupons and Store Loyalty Programs Clip coupons, use smartphone apps, and participate in store loyalty programs to take advantage of special discounts and promotions. Step 6: Choose Inexpensive, Nutritious Ingredients Select foods that are cheap but nutritious, such as beans, lentils, eggs, whole grains, and frozen fruits and vegetables. This helps you maintain a healthy diet while staying within budget. Step 7: Limit Eating Out and Opt for More Affordable Options When you do choose to eat out, opt for less expensive dining options like fast food, takeout, or \\"budget-friendly\\" restaurants with affordable pricing.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. (a). no. (b). yes.","completion":"Backward time travel has been a captivating concept for centuries, often featured in science fiction literature and films. The possibility of traveling into the past raises numerous paradoxes and complexities, which have challenged scientists and philosophers alike. To evaluate the possibility of backward time travel, we need to rely on our existing scientific understanding of space and time. According to Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, space and time are interconnected and form a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. Massive objects, such as planets and stars, curve this fabric, which gives rise to the force of gravity. Time dilation, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's theory, occurs when an object's velocity or the presence of a strong gravitational field affects its passage through time relative to an object at rest or in a weaker field. This has been experimentally tested and confirmed, and opens the door for the possibility of time travel under the right conditions. Einstein’s equations also led to the theoretical discovery of \\"closed timelike curves\\" by mathematician Kurt Gödel in 1949, which suggest that closed loops in spacetime might allow time travel into the past. However, the presence of such curves is highly debated and their existence would necessitate cosmic conditions far beyond our comprehension and current technology to access. More recent theories, such as those involving wormholes or black holes, have also been proposed as potential gateways to time travel. It is theorized that if one could stabilize a wormhole and adjust its ends within spacetime, one might facilitate travel into the past or future. In the case of black holes, their immense gravity can create an effect called \\"gravitational time dilation,\\" in which time moves slower the closer you get to a black hole. In theory, it might be possible to orbit a black hole close enough that time dilation occurs, allowing the traveler to move into the future. However, these theories have not been experimentally verified, and it is uncertain whether it would ever be possible to implement or control these phenomena in practice. Addressing the second part of your question: The two questions \\"Is backward time travel possible?\\" and \\"What is the possibility of time travel becoming a reality?\\" are similar but not equivalent. The first question specifically refers to the feasibility of backward time travel, while the second question is broader and encompasses both the feasibility and development of time travel as a whole, including travel to the future. It is important to note that our current understanding of physics does not prohibit the possibility of time travel completely, but backward time travel, especially, is laden with numerous challenges that we have not found a way to overcome. With our current level of technology and understanding of the universe, it is impossible to predict with certainty whether time travel will ever become obtainable. Scientists are continually exploring the intricacies of spacetime, and future discoveries might shed new light on the subject. Based on the context provided, the answer would be (a). No - the two questions do not have the exact same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

He also has a lifelong crush over the perfect girl, beautiful Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner), but she doesn't want a fat, snub-nosed loser as her husband. That would ruin her chances to have perfect genetically beautiful, pretty babies. The setting for the story is somewhat odd. Nobody can actually lie about anything, they don't even know about the word as its not invented yet. Mark is about to get thrown out of his apartment for his inability to pay the rent. So, he goes to the bank to withdraw all his cash. But, there's a technical glitch in the computers and they ask the amount he has to withdraw from his account. He asks for 800 instead of 300 and the systems are back on. But, the lady says there must be a mistake as the system shows 300 and she gives him 800 thinking the system is corrupt! Here inadvertently, Mark invents the art of lying. He is the first person ever to lie and its as easy as drinking water to him and everybody believes whatever he says. His Mom gets sick, and he makes up a story about an afterlife to help comfort his Mom on her deathbed. Doctors and nurses overhear him, and soon Mark becomes an international authority on the afterlife. People camp on his lawn to learn more. Mark develops a story about the \\"Man in the Sky,\\" who functions like God, and he pastes his theology on two pizza boxes like Moses and the Ten Commandments.

In this fictional world, lying has not been invented, and everyone always tells the truth. People in this world don't even know the concept of lying and there is no word for it. Mark's life takes a significant turn when he goes to a bank to withdraw the remaining money from his account. Due to a technical glitch, the bank employee asks him the amount he wants to withdraw instead of checking his account balance. Mark, intending to withdraw his actual balance of 300, suddenly decides to ask for 800, realizing that he can lie and nobody will suspect it. The bank employee believes him and gives him the money, thinking the computer system is at fault. This event marks the first time when Mark learns the art of lying in a society where no one else can. Mark begins using this newfound ability to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. He lies about an afterlife to provide comfort to his dying mother, which leads to a series of misunderstandings and an overnight transformation into an international authority on the concept of the afterlife. People start camping on his lawn to learn more about his stories. As he lies more and more, Mark develops a story about the \\"Man in the Sky\\" who functions like God, creating a religion and putting together ten commandments-like rules on two pizza boxes. Mark uses lying to change his life completely - he sways his old company to rehire him and becomes rich and famous. In conclusion, the habit that Mark picks up in the movie \\"The Invention of Lying\\" is lying itself. Introducing this concept in a society where it has never existed before, Mark uses it to his benefit and changes his life for the better.

Paragraph: Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan and the Greco-Indian Kingdom (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). The first figural portrayals of the Buddha, previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of Apollo. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from Greek astronomy filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced Indian astronomy by the early centuries AD. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth. The Yavanajataka and Paulisa Siddhanta texts in particular show Greek influence.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown run compared to the shortest touchdown run?","completion":"Title: The Great Divide: A Look at the Longest and Shortest Touchdown Runs in NFL History Introduction The National Football League (NFL) has seen countless incredible plays and astonishing moments that have left spectators in awe. Among these astonishing moments are the moments where players have made record-breaking touchdown runs. These plays have become immortalized in the memories of football fans, etched into sports history, and discussed around water coolers across the country. However, one question that arises in the minds of football enthusiasts is how many yards longer the longest touchdown run was compared to the shortest touchdown run? This article will dive into the history of the NFL's most memorable touchdowns to explore this fascinating comparison. The Longest Touchdown Run The longest touchdown run in NFL history is held by Derrick Henry, who achieved this record-breaking feat while playing for the Tennessee Titans in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on December 6, 2018. Henry's staggering 99-yard touchdown run is the pinnacle of running back achievements, having cemented his place in the history of the league. This incredible dash down the field occurred when Henry took a handoff from his quarterback, Marcus Mariota, on his team's 1-yard line, and took off down the sideline, stiff-arming multiple defenders on his way to the end zone. This unforgettable play not only showcased Henry's incredible speed and skill but also highlighted an impressive display of determination and endurance. The 99-yard run equaled Tony Dorsett's record run that took place on January 3, 1983, during a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings. The Shortest Touchdown Run On the other end of the spectrum lies the shortest touchdown run in NFL history. Though there is no official \\"record\\" for the shortest touchdown run, many players have experienced scoring a one-yard touchdown. The one-yard touchdown can occur in several scenarios, such as a running back plunging through the defensive line to reach the end zone or a quarterback sneaking the ball in behind the offensive line on a goal-line stand. While these plays may not garner as much attention as their longer counterparts, they still contribute to the team's overall score and can often be just as pivotal in a game's outcome. Examples include Marshawn Lynch's numerous \\"Beast Mode\\" one-yard runs or Tom Brady's iconic quarterback sneaks. The Yardage Difference Now that we have established the extremes in touchdown runs, we can answer the question at hand—how many yards longer was the longest touchdown run compared to the shortest touchdown run? The answer is simple and straightforward: the longest touchdown run in NFL history, held by Derrick Henry, spans a remarkable 99-yard distance, while the shortest touchdown run covers only one yard. Consequently, the difference between these two touchdown runs is 98 yards. This vast yardage difference demonstrates the diverse range of talent and skill that professional football players possess and further emphasizes the varied and awe-inspiring moments that fill the annals of NFL history. Conclusion In conclusion, the longest touchdown run compared to the shortest touchdown run in NFL history spans 98 yards, showcasing the astounding spectrum of achievements that professional athletes are capable of. These football plays, as well as all the moments in between, continue to captivate fans, spark intense debates, and fuel the passion for this beloved sport. Whether a one-yard plunge or a 99-yard sprint, every touchdown contributes to the ever-growing legacy of the National Football League."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture. But I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. What is an answer for this question: Which land had fewer wetland plants growing on it? Answer:","completion":"From the information provided in the scenario, the Western land would have fewer wetland plants growing on it. Here's why: Your scenario mentions that the Eastern land was covered in wetlands, while the Western land had good, rich soil more conducive to agriculture. Wetland plants typically thrive in, as their name suggests, wet lands. They are plants that are adapted to and often thrive in conditions where hypoxia—a state of low oxygen—is prevalent. This is typically the case for soil that is flooded, causing its oxygen to be consumed faster by soil microorganisms than it is supplied, which is common in wetlands. Consequently, these conditions would create an ideal environment for wetland plants, leading us to conclude that more of them would grow on the Eastern land. On the other hand, the Western land with fertile and presumably less water-saturated soil would not be as suitable for wetland plants. This type of environment is more suitable for agricultural crops or other plant species better adapted to such soil conditions. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that there would be fewer wetland plants on the Western land due to its soil and environmental conditions, as well as its stated use for agriculture. Moreover, the consideration of hypoxia and the presence of aerenchyma—a modification of parenchymal cells, found in many wetland plant species that enable them to transport and ‘breathe’ oxygen under saturated soil conditions—would not significantly impact this assessment. This is because these mechanisms would primarily be beneficial to the wetland plants in the Eastern land, aiding their survival in the wet, oxygen-depleted soil conditions these plants are adapted for. In conclusion, given that the Western land is well-suited to agricultural use and not identified as a wetland, it's reasonable to assert that the Western land would have fewer wetland plants than the Eastern land."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Compared to Iron Man 1, which I really like, Iron Man 2 has more action, better special effects and is funnier. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces two enemies--a weapon producer named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a horrible-looking Russian who wants revenge for something related to Tony's father. Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body. My favourite part of the movie was when Iron Man uses his laser against an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots. Everyone in the theater was cheering. My favourite special effects scene was the fight scene at a car race. Ivan tore Tony's car apart piece by piece. A funny part in the movie is when Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is inside a boxing ring with Happy Hogan (played by director Jon Favreau). Happy Hogan tries to hit Natalie Rushman.

Article: A generation later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)

People have money problems, work problems, family problems, health problems..... the list goes on. And we usually think that people who are happy and successful are having fewer problems than us. Look at the successful people we often mention. They have money they need, they have jobs they love, they have good friends, they have obedient kids, they have the successful business, they have loving families etc. Everything goes well with them. That is why they are happy and successful. But in fact, the more successful you are, the more problems you have to face. More success means more challenges they have to face, and more success means more risks they have to take. Young and old, rich and poor, successful and unsuccessful, educated and uneducated, all have problems. The difference is that their problems are different from each other. Rich and successful have big problems. Poor and unsuccessful have small problems. Still they all have problems which they can face. Successful people are successful just because they are ready to face challenges larger than ordinary people. Winning the US elections makes Obama very happy. As a new US president, he has to face bigger challenges. He has to be more careful about his work he does, or he will lose his position . Looking at him, we may say he is lucky, happy and successful.

This can include TVs, cell phones and computers and other office electronics, electronic toys and videos machines. Today, the average turnover rate for a computer in the United States is every two years, according to the environmental group, Greenpeace. The group's Dai Yun says e-waste is a global problem. \\"The electronic industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. The high speed of growth in this industry means more and more electronic products are being wasted and thrown away. If no one decides to retrieve the old products and process them properly, the electronic waste will sweep over the earth like the huge wave behind me and pollute the Earth seriously.\\" Greenpeace works out that 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are produced globally each year. The components in many electronic products contain harmful chemicals that pollute ground water and the environment. At present , the U.S. has no federal law for the disposal of e-waste although a few states have e-waste recycling programs in place, but there is no law. The U.S. exports much of its e-waste to third world countries, such as India and China, where workers took apart computers for valuable parts, hoping to sell them for money. But harmful wastes expert, Dr. Bakul Rao, says that's a dangerous practice. \\"From now on, the recyclers are not very educated. All they know is they can retrieve copper or gold out of it.

He always knew his proper station in life, which was in the middle of the middle class; our house was medium-sized; he had avoided joining Royal Liverpool Golf Club and went to a smaller one instead; though once he had got a second-hand Rolls-Royce at a remarkably low price, he felt embarrassed driving it, and quickly changed it for an Austin 1100. This could only be his delightful way of telling me that the whole boarding school idea was to be dropped. Alas !

They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence. - John Nichols Dalton ( July 11 , 1931 -- July 30 , 1986 ) was the 63rd Governor of the U.S. state of Virginia , serving from 1978 to 1982 .

With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Ralph Shearer Northam (born September 13, 1959) is an American physician and politician, currently serving as the 40th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. On November 5, 2013, Northam became the first Democrat since Tim Kaine in 2001 to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, defeating the Republican nominee, E.W. Jackson. - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. - The Lieutenant Governor is a constitutional officer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Lieutenant Governor is elected every four years along with the Governor and Attorney General. The office is currently held by Democrat Ralph Northam.

Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity. - A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction, but is often the deputy or lieutenant to or ranking under a governor a \\"second-in-command\\". A notable exception to this would be in Canada and a few other Commonwealth realms, in which the lieutenant governor is the representative of the monarch in that jurisdiction. - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia. - Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States.

Write a \\"B.\\" movie review (Options are: A. negative; B. positive;).","completion":"Title: \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" Review: \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" is an exhilarating, tongue-in-cheek B-movie that absolutely deserves a place of honor among the cult classic science fiction films of the past few decades. With its endearing blend of comedy, action, and sci-fi thrills, this campy, low-budget joyride will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most unexpectedly entertaining films in recent memory. Directed by the up-and-coming auteur Jackson Samuels, \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" tells the story of a tiny, peaceful American town suddenly besieged by an invasion of otherworldly, killer tomato-shaped creatures. The film's unique blend of nostalgia, camp, and absurdity transports audiences back to the 1950s, when B-movies featuring alien invasions and monstrous creatures from outer space were all the rage. One of the movie's most notable strengths lies in its ensemble cast, which delivers pitch-perfect performances that effectively mix earnest acting with impeccable comic timing. Leading the film is the charming Parker Dawson, who plays Bill, a capable yet humble grocery store employee forced to defend his town from the rampaging Tomatoids. Dawson deftly channels the spirit of classic B-movie heroes, while adding his own flair and impressive physicality to his role. Ably supporting Dawson in the film are local diner waitress Molly, played with spunk and sass by Emma Landon, and conspiracy theorist-turned-vigilante Dr. Ned Kipp, played to mischievous perfection by the scene-stealing James Vickers. \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" truly shines in its use of practical special effects and innovative low-budget filmmaking techniques. The film's eponymous creatures, brought to life by a combination of handcrafted puppetry, stop-motion animation, and clever camera tricks, are a visual treat that evokes the charm and artistry of classic creature features. It is evident that the film's creators poured their hearts and souls into every frame of their work, investing this zany, apocalyptic adventure with an undeniable sense of love and dedication which bleeds through the screen. While the storyline is decidedly tongue-in-cheek, the screenplay never slacks in its commitment to delivering outrageous twists and turns, not to mention its fair share of quotable one-liners. This gleefully self-aware approach to storytelling complements the film's inherent absurdity, resulting in a narrative that is both wildly unpredictable and consistently engaging. Composer Rebecca Wright provides the film with a unique score that artfully straddles the line between atmospheric, otherworldly ambiance and catchy, rockabilly swing. The music adds an extra layer of character and energy to the film while simultaneously paying homage to the B-movie sci-fi horror flicks of yesteryear. Ultimately, \\"Attack of the Alien Tomatoids\\" is everything a modern B-movie should be: unapologetically campy, utterly ridiculous, and endlessly entertaining. Despite its low budget and underdog status, the film easily outshines many of its more mainstream counterparts and genuinely earns its place alongside the best-loved cult classics of the science fiction genre. Do yourself a favor and bask in the misadventures of Bill, Molly, Dr. Kipp, and the rest of the gang as they daringly defend their small town (and the world) from the impending Tomatoid takeover.

Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio. However it did not adhere to Palladio's... A:","completion":"The last names of the two people Coke met in Italy are Burlington and Kent."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what did the ottoman empire look like? Answer:","completion":"In order to provide the correct facts to answer the question \\"What did the Ottoman Empire look like?\\", I will need to gather information about its geographical extent, historical timeline, cultural aspects, and administrative structure. Step 1: Research the historical timeline of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was founded by Osman I in 1299 and lasted until the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. It reached its peak during the rule of Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century. Step 2: Investigate the geographical extent of the Ottoman Empire At its peak, the Ottoman Empire spanned three continents, covering parts of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. Its territories included modern-day countries such as Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. The empire also had extensive control over maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean, Red, and Black Seas. Step 3: Explore the cultural aspects of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was a melting pot of various cultures and religions due to its vast territorial extent and diverse population. As a predominantly Islamic empire, it adhered to Sunni Islam, while other religious groups like Christians and Jews could practice their faith within the bounds of the empire's legal system. The official language was Ottoman Turkish, but many other languages were spoken within the empire, such as Arabic, Greek, Slavic languages, and more. Step 4: Understand the administrative structure of the Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was an absolute monarchy, ruled by a Sultan. The Sultan was both the political leader and the religious leader (Caliph) of the empire. The administration was highly centralized, with a hierarchical structure of regional governors, military commanders, and other officials answering directly to the Sultan's authority. The empire's legal system was based on a combination of Islamic and secular laws, with the Sultan having the ultimate authority in all matters. Answer: The Ottoman Empire was a vast and diverse empire founded by Osman I in 1299 and lasting until 1923. At its peak during the 16th century under Suleiman the Magnificent, it covered parts of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa.

Based on the premise \\"For example, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act requires OMB to ensure that federal agencies, when practicable, allow individuals and other entities the option to submit information to the agency electronically and maintain records electronically by October 21, 2003.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The paperwork in the government is quite excessive.\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate whether the hypothesis \\"The paperwork in the government is quite excessive\\" is true, based on the premise provided, we need to consider the context and intent of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), as well as other factors that could contribute to excessive paperwork in government. The GPEA, enacted in 1998, was a response to a growing concern about the increasing amount of paperwork generated and maintained by federal agencies. The main aim of the Act was to promote the use of electronic documents, signatures, and record-keeping in an effort to reduce the administrative burden on citizens and businesses and improve the efficiency of the government. The Act mandated that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should ensure federal agencies provide the option of electronic submission of information and maintenance of records wherever practicable by October 21, 2003. It is important to note that the GPEA was passed more than two decades ago, and since then, technology and the use of electronic documentation have continued to evolve. As a result, many government agencies have made significant progress in reducing their reliance on paper documents and transitioning to electronic systems. However, the premise provided indicates that there was an issue of excessive paperwork, at least at the time GPEA was enacted. Government functions, regulations, and operations can contribute to the generation of large amounts of paperwork. Factors such as bureaucratic processes, the requirement for physical signatures, and the need to maintain records for long periods of time can all contribute to paperwork accumulation. Taking these factors into account, it could be inferred that the premise at least partially supports the hypothesis that paperwork in the government was excessive at some point, at least around the time when the GPEA was enacted. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the situation has evolved over the years, and government agencies have taken steps to reduce paperwork and streamline processes through various initiatives, including digitization. In conclusion, while the premise supports the idea that excessive paperwork was an issue around the time the GPEA was enacted, it does not provide definitive evidence for the current state of paperwork in government agencies. In order to assess whether paperwork is still excessive now, updated information and data on the current state of government record-keeping and documentation processes are needed. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation should consider factors such as the efficiency of modern electronic systems in government agencies, the decreased reliance on paper documents, and the effectiveness of the GPEA in achieving its objectives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: I. at the cerebrum; II. at the medulla oblongata; III. at the meninges; IV. at the pons; Answer the following question given this paragraph: Secondary Vesicles The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a structure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo, but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system. The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is useful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively speaking. The rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning “little brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and cerebellum develop out of the same vesicle. The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the medulla oblongata. The structures that come. Q: Where is the most significant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain? A: Answer:","completion":"IV. at the pons; In the paragraph provided, it is described how the brain develops from its primary to secondary vesicles. During this process, the rhombencephalon differentiates into the metencephalon and myelencephalon.

Which now retired English football referee booked Croatian Josip Simunic three times (playing against Australia) in the 2006 World Cup?","completion":"The now-retired English football referee who famously booked Croatian Josip Šimunić three times in a match against Australia during the 2006 FIFA World Cup is Graham Poll. Poll is a former top-level referee, having officiated in the English Premier League and numerous international tournaments, including UEFA Champions League and European Championship matches. He was regarded as one of the best referees in the world during his career. This unusual incident occurred on June 22, 2006, during the final group stage match between Australia and Croatia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, held in Stuttgart, Germany. Šimunić was first shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a sliding foul on Australian winger Brett Emerton. In the 90th minute, Šimunić fouled an Australian player again, and Poll showed him a second yellow card, which technically equates to a red card for an immediate dismissal from the match. However, Poll failed to realize that he had already booked Šimunić earlier and didn't send him off at that point. Moments after the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll to argue about a decision and was shown a third yellow card for dissent, followed by a red card. Later, it was learned that Poll had mistakenly recorded Šimunić's first booking under the name of Australian defender Craig Moore, which led to the confusion. The match ended in a 2-2 draw, and Australia advanced to the round of sixteen, while Croatia was eliminated. In the aftermath, FIFA conducted an inquiry, and Poll took responsibility for his mistake. As a result, Poll was not appointed for any further matches in the tournament and subsequently retired from international refereeing soon after the World Cup. Despite his successful career as a referee, Graham Poll's oversight in the match between Australia and Croatia, unfortunately, remains one of the most remembered moments of his refereeing career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After they delivered it, we noticed that it was extremely firm! nothing like the mattress we laid on in the store. We were told by our Salesman Cameron that it would soften up, which it never really did. After weeks of waking up with back aches, we decided to return the mattress and try something different. That's when we learned their \\"120 day comfort guarantee\\" or your money back, is very deceptive. Since they had matched a competitors price on the original mattress, we needed them to match a competitors price our replacement mattress in order to have an even or similar exchange. When I asked my salesman Cameron if they would match a competitors price on the replacement mattress, he got very rude and condescending. He said that because they were taking back the original mattress, they were doing me a favor, so I would have to pay full list price for the replacement mattress and pay the difference, which was hundreds of dollars more!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Along with Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, who altered and diluted the interior features of the house he commissioned in 1967? Answer the above question based on the context below: The commission for the brand new house of Knightshayes Court was obtained from Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1867 and the foundation stone was laid in 1869. By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs on the grounds of cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built. The interior was to have been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.Since the house passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of restoration and re-creation have been undertaken and a number of pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace. Answer:","completion":"In 1967, alongside Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, it was John Dibblee Crace who altered and diluted the interior features of the house commissioned at Knightshayes Court.

We can conclude that she's likely practicing or performing a jump rope routine. Step 2: Identify possible events that could follow When thinking about what could naturally follow after her jumps, we can consider a few possibilities: - She might continue to perform the routine, with more jumps, flips, or spins. - She might take a break or pause to catch her breath. - She might receive feedback or praise from someone observing her or recording her performance. - She might adjust the rope or her technique to continue, depending on her comfort and expertise. Step 3: Determine the most natural follow-up From the listed events above, the most natural follow-up would be for her to continue her routine, as she has just started jumping. It is safe to assume that her routine involves a series of jumps, spins, and kicks, and she would continue to showcase these moves as part of her overall performance. Step 4: Justify the chosen follow-up The chosen follow-up of continuing the routine is justified because the scenario mentions her jumping, kicking, and turning in the air, implying that she has a planned routine or performance in progress. It is unlikely that she would pause or switch to another action immediately after starting, as there is no mention of any distractions or interferences.

Context: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että komission tulisi lisätä tukien valvontaa, parantaa niiden kohdentamista ja lisätä avoimuutta niiden käytössä. Näin voidaan estää tukien väärinkäytön esiintyminen ja varmistaa, että ne täyttävät niille asetetut tavoitteet. Ensisijaisesti komissio voisi lisätä resursseja tukien valvontaan, jotta voidaan toteuttaa tehokkaampia tarkastuksia ja seurantaa tuensaajien toiminnasta. Tämän toimenpiteen avulla voidaan tunnistaa ja ehkäistä mahdolliset väärinkäytökset ennen kuin ne pääsevät laajenemaan laajemmalle. Toiseksi on tärkeää, että komissio panostaa tukien kohdentamisen kehittämiseen niin, että ne ohjautuvat todellisiin tarpeisiin ja tuottavat parhaan mahdollisen vaikutuksen. Tämä voidaan saavuttaa esimerkiksi analysoimalla tuensaajien profiileja, hyödyntämällä alueellista ja paikallista tietoa sekä parantamalla tukien hakuprosesseja ja -kriteereitä. Kolmanneksi komission tulee edistää avoimuutta tukien myöntämisessä ja käytössä.

Tämä lisää läpinäkyvyyttä ja auttaa varmistamaan, että tukien väärinkäytöstapaukset tulevat julkiseen tietoon ja niihin voidaan puuttua ajoissa. Lopuksi on hyvä muistaa, että komission tehtävä on toimia jäsenmaiden kanssa yhteistyössä tukien käytön tehostamiseksi ja väärinkäytösten torjumiseksi.

There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma. Andrei tells him, \\"I washed brushes for three years for Danila... My question: who are share the cell?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Sometimes it's possible to keep working or going to school with a cold, but when you have the flu, it's important to rest. Take a few days off to give your body time to recover. Since the flu is contagious, staying home is as considerate as it is necessary for your recovery. You may experience congestion with the flu. Elevating your head with an extra pillow or sleeping in a recliner can make it easier to breathe at night. Having a fever causes dehydration, so it's important to drink more fluids than you normally would to combat the illness. Drink lots of water and hot fluids like tea or warm water with lemon, which will soothe your throat and clear your sinuses while hydrating you. If you have also been vomiting, you may have an electrolyte imbalance. Use an oral rehydration solution or a sports drink containing electrolytes to replenish your body. Avoid caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and soda. Choose fluids that will restore your body's nutrients and minerals, not deplete them. Drink hot soup. You may experience nausea and a lack of appetite during the flu illness. Drinking hot soup or broth is a good way to get food into your system without upsetting your stomach. Studies have shown that chicken soup can actually mitigate inflammation in your respiratory tract, so if you’re feeling well enough, eating a bowl or two could really help. Vitamin C is crucial for supporting your body’s immune health. Studies suggest that a “megadose” of vitamin C can help relieve cold and flu symptoms. Take 1000mg per hour for the first 6 hours as soon as symptoms appear. Then take 1000mg 3 times a day while you still have symptoms. Do not continue to take extremely high doses of vitamin C after you feel better, as vitamin C toxicity is rare but can happen. Orange juice is a good source of natural vitamin C but cannot provide a megadose. Talk to your child's doctor before giving high doses of vitamin C to your child. often. When you're congested, it's important to clear your breathing passage of mucus often, to prevent getting a sinus or ear infection. Clear mucus in the following ways: Blow your nose. It's simple but effective. blow your nose as often as it clogs to keep your breathing passage free. Use a neti pot. Neti pots are a natural method for clearing your nasal passages. Take a hot bath or shower. The steam from the water helps loosen the mucus. A humidifier or vaporizer in your room may make breathing easier. Use nasal saline sprays. You can also make your own nasal saline sprays or drops. The application of heat helps relieve the aches and pains that come with flu sickness. Use an electric heating pad or fill up a hot water bottle and lay it on your chest or back, wherever you feel pain. Just be sure not to have it too hot that it burns your skin or to leave it on too long. Never go to sleep with a heating pad or hot water bottle on your body. You can relieve the discomfort of fever symptoms by placing a cool, damp washcloth on your skin wherever you feel feverish. It can also help soothe sinus congestion when applied to the forehead and around the eyes. A reusable gel pad can be found at most drug stores and can also help you feel cooler. To cool a child down with a fever over 102°F or a child that is very uncomfortable with a fever, apply cooled damp towels to the forehead to bring down the body temperature. with saltwater. A simple saltwater solution can relieve a sore throat, which is associated with the flu. Mix together 1 teaspoon (5.69 grams) of salt with one cup of warm water. Gargle for a minute or so then spit the water out. Don’t swallow the saltwater gargle. There is only limited scientific evidence for most herbal treatments for the flu. However, you may find some relief from one of these remedies. You should consult with your doctor before taking any herbal remedies if you take any medications, have any chronic medical conditions, or are treating a child. Take 300mg of Echinacea three times daily. Echinacea 'may' help shorten the duration of your symptoms. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, people taking immunosuppressant drugs, and people who allergic to ragweed should not use echinacea. Take 200mg of American ginseng daily. American ginseng (which is not the same as Siberian or Asian ginseng) may help make flu symptoms milder. Take 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of Sambucol per day. Sambucol is an elderberry extract and has performed well in shortening the duration of the flu. You can also brew an elderberry tea by steeping 3-5 grams of dried elderflower in 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of boiling water for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the tea and drink it up to 3 times a day. A eucalyptus steam treatment can help soothe a cough or congestion. Add 5 to 10 drops of eucalyptus oil to 2 cups (470 mL) of boiling water. Allow to boil for 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Cover your head with a clean towel and place your head over the pot. Keep your face at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from the water to avoid burns. Inhale the steam for 10 to 15 minutes. Move the pot to a stable surface, such as a table or countertop. You can use peppermint or spearmint oil instead of the eucalyptus if you prefer. The active ingredient in mint, menthol, is an excellent decongestant. Do not consume any essential oil internally. Many are toxic when ingested.","completion":"When you have the flu, it's important to rest, stay home, drink fluids like water and soup, take vitamin C, and use heat to relieve aches and pains, while also trying some herbal remedies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation, and we need to find out what 'n' is: 20*n + 486581 - 488241 = 0 Let's first handle the numbers: 486581 - 488241 = -1660 (Because 488241 is bigger than 486581, the result is negative) Now, the equation looks like this: 20*n - 1660 = 0 We want to find out what number to multiply by 20 and then subtract 1660 to get 0. Let's work on that: 20*n = 1660 (We moved the -1660 to the other side by adding 1660 to both sides) Now, we just need to divide both sides by 20 to find 'n': n = 1660 / 20 n = 83 So, the solution is n = 83.

If I push my foot back where it normally sits, then the size is perfect.I dropped one star simply because I placed an order for the Dream model, but instead I got the Eva model. When I went back to Amazon, I noticed that when I add the item to the cart, it said it was the Eva model. I would have preferred the more structured sole of the Dream, but the Eva works fine.

Help as much as you can. What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted? from the following article ? SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured.

You are given a new situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. and a hint : The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. Please answer this question : Which river didn't have a food source mostly derived from algae?

(Associated Press) Gendarme Bruno Hermignies stands by a bulldozer clearing a path to the crash site near Seyne-les-Alpes, France, Monday, March 30, 2015. European investigators are focusing on the psychological state... (Associated Press) The airline said that as part of its internal research it found emails that Andreas Lubitz sent to the Lufthansa flight school in Bremen when he resumed his training there after an interruption of several months. In them, he informed the school that he had suffered a \\"serious depressive episode,\\" which had since subsided. The airline said Lubitz subsequently passed all medical checks and that it has provided the documents to prosecutors. It declined to make any further comment. The revelation that officials Lufthansa had been informed of Lubitz's psychological problems raises further questions about why he was allowed to become a pilot for its subsidiary, Germanwings, in September 2013. Authorities say the 27-year-old Lubitz, who in the past had been treated for suicidal tendencies, locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing the Airbus 320 into a mountain in the French Alps on March 24. All 150 people aboard Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf were killed. Earlier Tuesday, Lufthansa said it had set aside 300 million to deal with possible costs from the crash as French aviation investigators said they were examining \\"systemic weaknesses\\" like cockpit entry rules and psychological screening procedures that could have led to the Germanwings plane crash — issues that could eventually change worldwide aviation practices. French aviation agency BEA signaled the latest re-think about airline procedures in the wake of the Germanwings crash, which jolted an aviation industry already reeling after one passenger plane disappeared into an ocean and another was shot out of the sky over war-torn eastern Ukraine. The goal of the BEA investigation is to make recommendations to aviation authorities, not just in France but anywhere, about what can be done to prevent similar crashes. French prosecutors are carrying out a separate crash probe to pinpoint possible criminal wrongdoing. The Germanwings crash has already produced some changes in aviation procedures. Europe's aviation regulator now says all airlines in Europe should require two people in the cockpit at all times during a flight. Many airlines have already imposed the new rule, which has been in place in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks. The International Civil Aviation Organization, which brings together 191 nations, said state agencies like the BEA must officially determine the causes and contributing factors of crashes and give recommendations on ways to avoid recurrences. ICAO could then bring such recommendations to its member states — possibly leading to changes in international aviation standards. BEA said it aims to provide a \\"detailed analysis\\" of the Germanwings cockpit voice recorder and any other flight data — but it also plans to widen its search, to examine issues that could be problematic for all airlines. \\"(We will study) systemic weaknesses (that) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster,\\" BEA said in its first statement since prosecutors detailed the co-pilot's suspected role in the crash. The agency is studying both psychological screening procedures and rules applied to entering and leaving the cockpit, as well as cockpit door locking systems. German prosecutors say Lubitz received psychotherapy before obtaining his pilot's license and that medical records from that time referred to \\"suicidal tendencies.\\" They have given no dates for his treatment, but said visits to doctors since then showed no record of any suicidal tendencies or aggression against others. They also have found torn-up sick notes from doctors, including one that would have kept Lubitz off work on the day of the crash. At the crash site in the French Alps, investigators said they hope to have found DNA samples for everyone killed on the flight in the next 24 hours. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, speaking in the town of Le Vernet, said the search was still on for the plane's second black box — its data recorder. \\"By the end of the week at the latest, it will be possible to identify all the victims thanks to the DNA samples taken,\\" French President Francois Hollande told reporters during a trip to Germany. Hollande said German and French ministers also discussed the need to improve checks of air passengers within Europe's visa-free Schengen travel zone and to \\"ensure that we can also strengthen our safety rules for piloting planes.\\" Construction workers have cut a road up to the steep, mountainous crash site to speed up recovery efforts. Previously, emergency workers had to rely on helicopters. German investigators tasked with identifying the victims and determining their cause of death are expected Wednesday at the crash site. In Frankfurt, Lufthansa spokeswoman Kerstin Lau said insurers have reserved 300 million to deal with \\"all costs arising in connection with the case.\\" Lufthansa — Germanwings' parent company — offered immediate aid last week of up to 50,000 euros (54,250) per passenger to relatives of the victims. Those payments are separate from eventual compensation payments. Airlines on international flights are required to compensate relatives of victims for proven damages of up to a limit of about 157,000 — regardless of what caused the crash. However, higher compensation is possible if a carrier is held liable. Lufthansa has canceled plans to celebrate its 60th anniversary on April 15 \\"out of respect for the victims of the crash.\\" ___ Moulson reported from Berlin. Lori Hinnant in Le Vernet, France contributed to this report. ||||| Dusseldorf, Germany (CNN) Years before he was at the controls of a Germanwings plane that plunged into the French Alps, Andreas Lubitz told the airline he worked for that he'd had a bout with depression. Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane, told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \\"previous episode of severe depression,\\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \\"swift and seamless clarification\\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. It's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation, but it's only one piece of the puzzle, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said. \\"We need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training, because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process,\\" he said. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and \\"held all the licenses required.\\" JUST WATCHED Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time 00:10 Possible motive: Fear of losing license The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf said Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career. Medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation into last week's crash told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \\"a big part of his life,\\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. Lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work, the official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \\"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\\" he said. \\"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\\" Video of flight's final seconds? Reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of Germanwings Flight 9525, but a police spokesman said the accounts were \\"completely wrong.\\" French magazine Paris Match and German newspaper Bild reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed. \\"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,\\" Paris Match reported . \\"Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\\" The two publications described the video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications reported that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \\"It is a very disturbing scene,\\" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \\"completely wrong\\" and \\"unwarranted.\\" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they \\"hadn't been exploited yet.\\" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \\"no.\\" Reichelt told \\"Erin Burnett: Outfront\\" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \\"very confident\\" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \\"That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\\" he said. Recovery efforts continue While investigators search for clues to Lubitz's motivation, recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the March 24 crash. The remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using DNA analysis. Naffrechoux warned Monday that \\"it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash.\\" But French President Francois Hollande, speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, was more positive, saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Given the following context: In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper... answer the following question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863?

Process: - Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die - The ecosystem is out of balance, causing further problems - Question: suppose there are clouds that block the sunlight happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The scenario presented involves clouds that block sunlight, and the question asks how this would affect the damage caused by acid rain, particularly in regard to the second effect mentioned, which is the absorption of aluminum from the soil into water bodies. The answer should highlight whether this perturbation results in more, less, or no effect on the mentioned impact. Sunlight is an essential factor for the growth and productivity of ecosystems, as it provides the energy required for photosynthesis. Blocking sunlight due to cloud cover could cause the following changes: 1. Reduced photosynthesis: With less sunlight, the rate of photosynthesis in plants will decrease. This means that less carbon dioxide will be absorbed from the atmosphere, which could lead to increased greenhouse gas levels and climate change. 2. Lower temperatures: Reduced sunlight can lead to lower temperatures both in the atmosphere and on the ground. Lower temperatures could slow down chemical reactions, including the dissolution of aluminum in water bodies. 3. Reduced evaporation: With less sunlight and lower temperatures, the rate of evaporation of water from lakes, rivers, and other water bodies could decrease. When assessing whether the blocking of sunlight would cause more, less, or no effect on the absorption of aluminum due to acid rain, we must consider the following aspects: 1. The rate of aluminum dissolution: Aluminum absorption in water bodies occurs due to the acidification of waters by acid rain. Lower temperatures might slow this process down, resulting in less aluminum dissolving in the water. 2. The rate of runoff: Reduced sunlight and lower temperatures might lead to less evaporation, which could potentially increase the level of water in water bodies, diluting the acidic waters and decreasing the concentration of aluminum absorbed. 2. The effect on plants: Lower rates of photosynthesis might affect plant growth and their ability to absorb and store nutrients, including aluminum, from the soil. This could alter the soil's aluminum dynamics, which might either reduce or enhance aluminum absorption in water bodies depending on the species and local conditions. 3. The overall ecosystem health: Reduced sunlight and lower temperatures could negatively impact ecosystem health, making it less resilient to other stressors, including acid rain. This, in turn, might increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to the damage caused by acid rain, potentially causing further harm to the biotic and abiotic components. Based on these factors, it is difficult to attribute a definitive effect (more, less, or no effect) of the perturbation (blocking of sunlight by clouds) on the second consequence of acid rain (absorption of aluminum in water bodies). The influence of the perturbation depends on various interconnected factors, including temperature changes, ecosystem responses, and the rate of water runoff. Therefore, the effect of the perturbation on the second consequence could be location and condition-specific and is likely to be a complex interplay of multiple factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Grübl and, after Grübl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Grübl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Grübl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library.

During the hazing, Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that his family's political legacy is one in which he has no interest. After Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush states that he will help Bush for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks.

After heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His brother, Jeb, stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Consider all of the reasons that you and your ex broke up. Try to keep in mind that even if that you enjoyed being together for a while, something was not working. Thinking about the reasons why the relationship ended can help you understand why you need to move on. You may also be able to avoid making the same mistakes in the future if you can identify areas where you contributed to the demise of the relationship. Ask yourself some of the following questions: Did I contribute to the end of the relationship? If so, what did I do? Do I tend to choose the same sort of people to date? If so, what are they like? Are they good for me? Why or why not? Have I had similar problems in other relationships? If so, what is causing me to have these problems? What can I do differently in future relationships? Write in a journal or try writing poems. The most important thing is to be honest and don't edit yourself as you go. One of the best results of writing it all down is that sometimes you will be amazed by a sudden insight that comes to you as you are pouring it all out onto paper. Patterns may become clearer, and as your grieving begins to lessen, you will find it so much easier to understand valuable life lessons from the whole experience. Try writing down your feelings every day after your breakup until you feel better. For example, you could start each of your journal entries with “It has been __ days since we broke up and I feel _____” Then go into more detail about how you are feeling. Using this prompt will help you to see the progress of your emotions over time and process some of those emotions as well. Try writing a letter to your ex, but do not send it. Sometimes it just helps to get all of your feelings out. However, sending it is not a good idea. This letter is just for you, so write out everything you wish you could have said and be done with it. It doesn't do any good to rehash the breakup over and over again, so just pretend you are telling them how you feel for the last time. Try writing a story. Think back to when your relationship with this person began, and document it from beginning to end. This may be very painful, but it will give you a broader perspective. When you get to the final chapter, finish off on a positive note and write \\"The End\\". Feelings of anger occur when we feel we have been wronged or there has been unfair treatment. In a situation where you will not contact your ex-partner, the best way to deal with anger alone is to relax. Take deep breaths and focus on allowing your muscles to voluntarily relax. Soft music can often help. If the breakup was your decision, keep in mind that focusing on the good times you had with your partner may cause you to forget the reasons why you broke it off. By the same token, try not to second-guess the situation if the decision to end things was not yours. It's very common to romanticize the good parts of the relationship and convince yourself that the bad parts weren't so bad after all. Don't play this game with yourself. Accept the situation and work on moving forward. Focusing on all of the things that you don’t like about your ex can help you to get over the breakup faster. Try making a list of all of the things your ex did that you did not like. For example, maybe your ex often burped loudly after dinner, or made plans without you, or forgot your birthday. List every little thing that bothered you about your ex. In addition to reminding yourself of everything that bothered you about your ex, you can also benefit from thinking about the positives to your breakup. Make another list of all of the reasons why you are better off without your ex. For example, maybe your ex discouraged your efforts to eat healthy, so now you feel more empowered to follow a healthy diet and take better care of yourself. Or maybe your ex never wanted to do any of the things that you wanted to do, so now you have the freedom to do all of those things. List all of the reasons why you are better off without your ex.

(May 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1982, an alien spacecraft is discovered beneath the Antarctic ice by a team from a Norwegian research base: Edvard (Trond Espen Seim), Jonas (Kristofer Hivju), Olav (Jan Gunnar RÃ¸ise), Karl (Carsten BjÃ¸rnlund), Juliette (Kim Bubbs), Lars (JÃ¸rgen Langhelle), Henrik (Jo Adrian Haavind), Colin (Jonathan Lloyd Walker), and Peder (Stig Henrik Hoff). Columbia University paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant Adam Finch (Eric Christian Olsen) to investigate the discovery. They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near U.S. Outpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice. That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars' dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own. Derek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help. Kate discovers bloody dental fillings near a blood-soaked shower.

Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"observe agreements\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"observe agreements\\" is relevant to the chief factor in preventing unfairness. This is because observing agreements ensures that both parties are sticking to the rules and expectations set forth in an arrangement. By respecting and adhering to these agreements, people maintain a sense of fairness and trust, which contributes to a balanced relationship or negotiation. This can manifest in various aspects of life, including financial transactions, the division of resources, and participation in games or competitions.

Since the early 1990s, South Dakota has been using this slogan on its license plates to promote tourism and showcase the state's prominent features. The phrase reflects two primary aspects of the state: the iconic faces of Mount Rushmore, which represent America's history, and the numerous beautiful places found throughout South Dakota that offer stunning backdrops and exciting recreational opportunities. Mount Rushmore, situated in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, is one of the most famous symbols of American history. The sculpture was crafted between 1927 and 1941 and features the faces of four prominent U.S. presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. These faces are a major draw for tourists visiting the state, and the monument is widely regarded as an impressive piece of art and a testament to American craftsmanship. Apart from Mount Rushmore, South Dakota boasts many other great places that attract visitors from all around the world. The stunning Badlands National Park, which spans across 244,000 acres, is known for its dramatic landscapes, rich fossil history, and numerous hiking and wildlife-watching opportunities. The Crazy Horse Memorial, still under construction, is another fascinating site that honors the Native American leader Crazy Horse and the culture of the North American indigenous peoples. South Dakota is also home to the historic town of Deadwood, important to both gold rush and wild west history, Wind Cave National Park, which houses one of the world's longest and most complex cave systems, and Custer State Park, an expansive wildlife reserve and recreational area.

It pays for its programs from the television license money which everyone must pay if they have a television. The BBC, which is often known as \\"Auntie\\", is the biggest news collecting operation in the world. It has the world's largest network of foreign correspondents (;). Ten percent of the BBC's annual budget is spent on news collecting, reporting and presenting. More than 1,700 people work for the BBC news service. The BBC produces more than 214 hours of news and current affairs programs for radio and television each week. Each television news program costs about PS78,000 per hour and each radio news program costs approximately PS4,800 per hour. In the UK, about 19 million people -- almost 35% of the total population, watch the BBC television news progams every day. Developments in technology are improving news collection and presentation every year. The BBC now uses special cameras in the TV news studios to film the news presenters, and captions-- the words and sentences at the bottom of the screen, are now produced automatically by computer.

You can use a few approaches to try to stick to using your medication in times when you feel like quitting : Remind yourself that your medications treat, but tend not to cure, schizophrenia. This means for you to continue to feel better, you likely need to keep taking your medications. Use any social support you have; tell your family or friends when you are feeling well to strongly encourage you to keep going on with your meds when you feel like stopping. You could record yourself a message for your future self, telling you to keep going with your meds and why (they are a treatment not a cure) and have your family play it back to you when you feel like quitting. Accepting your condition may help to make your recovery an easier experience. On the other hand, denying that something is wrong or thinking that your condition will just go away may lead to your condition actually getting worse. Because of this, it is important to begin your treatment and accept these two facts: Yes, you have schizophrenia and it will be challenging to deal with. But yes, you can live a normal, happy life. Schizophrenia isn't a hopeless condition. You can learn to live with it. While accepting your diagnosis is important for seeking treatment, being willing to fight for a normal life can help you to live the life that you want to live. The initial shock upon hearing the diagnosis can be a very tough for the diagnosed and their families. Living a normal life is possible but it may take some time to adjust to your condition and to find the right treatment plan for you. People with schizophrenia who take their medications and go to therapy can have very few problems with social interactions, holding a job, having a family or otherwise excelling in life. Schizophrenia is often brought on when you experience a severe amount of stress. Because of this, if you have this condition, it is important to avoid things that may stress you out and cause you to have an episode. There are multiple ways to deal with stress, such as by: Each individual will have different stressors. Going to therapy can help you to identify the things that cause you stress, whether it be a specific person, situation, or place. Once you know your stressors, work hard to avoid them when you can. You can, for example, practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing. Exercise not only relieves your body of stress, but it can release endorphins which can increase your sense of well-being. Try listening to music that pumps you up and helps you get through your workout. Not getting a proper night’s rest can contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety. Be sure to get plenty of sleep at night; figure out how many hours a night you need to feel rested and stick to that. If you have trouble sleeping, try making you bedroom completely black and silent by blocking out sounds, changing your environment, or wearing a sleeping mask and earplugs. Get into a routine and follow it every night. When you eat unhealthy foods it can make you feel negative, which can add to your stress levels. Therefore, it is important to eat right to combat stress. Try eating lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Eating healthy involves having a balanced diet. Avoid eating too much of any one food. Although these are not a substitute for therapy or for a therapist, there are cognitive techniques you can try to alleviate your symptoms. You can, for example, use a technique called normalization. In this technique you see your psychotic experiences as part of the same continuum that includes normal experiences, and acknowledge that everyone has experiences that vary from normal, everyday life. This may make you feel less alienated and stigmatized, which can have a positive impact on your health outcomes. To cope with auditory hallucinations, such as hearing voices, try listing evidence against the content of the voice. For example, if a voice is telling you to do something negative, like stealing, list reasons why that is not a good idea (e.g., you could get into trouble, it is against social norms, it would cost someone else, most people would tell you not to do it, so don't listen to this one voice). If you are suffering from hallucinations, try distracting yourself in some way, by, for example, listening to music or making artwork. Do your best to become fully immersed in this new experience as it may help to block out unwanted experiences. To deal with the social anxiety that can accompany schizophrenia, try to identify then challenge distorted thoughts. For example, if you have the thought that \\"everyone in this room is looking at me\\" try questioning the truth value of this statement. Look around the room for evidence: is it the case that in fact everyone is looking at you? Ask yourself how much attention you pay to any one person when they are just walking about in public. Remind yourself that in a crowded room there are many people, and so people's attention is likely bouncing around to all of them, and they are probably not just all focused on you. Once you have your symptoms under control through medication and therapy, you should try to restart your normal life and keep busy. Idle time can lead to thinking about things that stress you out, which in turn may lead to an episode. To stay busy: Put in an effort at your job. Organize time to spend with your friends and family. Take up a new hobby. Help out a friend or volunteer somewhere. Sudden spikes in caffeine might make ‘positive’ symptoms of schizophrenia worse (i.e., unwanted additions such as delusions or hallucinations); although if you normally drink a lot of caffeine, stopping or having caffeine may not affect your symptoms for better or worse. The key is to avoid a large sudden change in your caffeine habits. It is recommended that individuals not consume more than 400 mg of caffeine a day. However, keep in mind that individuals’ body chemistries will vary, as will their prior history with caffeine, so you may be able to tolerate a little more or less than this Drinking alcohol is associated with worse treatment outcomes, increased symptomatology, and a higher rate of re-hospitalization. You will be better off if you refrain from drinking alcohol.

Movie title: The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior Context: Mathayus aims to avenge the death of his father at the hand of Sargon, now king of Akkad, by taking service in his Black Scorpions squad. After completing his training he is tasked by Sargon to kill Noah, Mathayus's own brother. He saves him and escapes the city, but a magic arrow follows them and kills Noah. Mathayus boards a ship to Egypt, accompanied by his childhood friend Layla. He intends to get the Spear of Osiris in Egypt, which he believes will be able to pass through Sargon's black magic protection. A fellow traveller, Greek poet Aristophanes (Ari), tells Mathayus and Layla that the Spear only kills Egyptian creatures, but the Sword of Damocles will work. The trio travels to Greece, where they can enter the Underworld to retrieve the Sword of Damocles. On the way, they fall into a cell and are surrounded by men left as sacrifices for the Minotaur. Some of the sacrifices are mercenaries who owe allegiance to Mathayus' father, so they help him and Layla to defeat the Minotaur, with help from a Chinese captive named Fung. The enlarged group travel to the Underworld, where they are attacked by the goddess Astarte. Layla and Astarte fight, while Fung and Ari search for and find the sword. Astarte tries to send Layla to hell, but Mathayus frees her, and they all escape to the human realm. Astarte orders Sargon to get her sword back, and he asks for more dark powers. The group reach Akkad, where Sargon turns on a machine that dumps oil into the water supply. The oil and water begin to flow through statues into the city, which is then set on fire. Using the Sword of Damocles, Mathayus fights through to Sargon but finds his own father, who turns out to be Sargon in disguise. Sargon uses the confusion to disarm Mathayus and they begin fighting.

In a momentous event, she finally got to deliver her acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. There is much to glean from this speech, delivered in Oslo, as it sheds light on her experiences, the importance of kindness, and her undeterred commitment to democracy and human rights. Being under house arrest for nearly 15 years did not deter Aung San Suu Kyi from advocating for democracy in her war-torn country. In her speech, she talked about what winning the Nobel Peace Prize meant to her. It was not the accolade itself that brought her solace but the fact that it made her \\"real\\" again for the international community. It allowed the world to look upon the struggles of Burma and its people, which might have otherwise been forgotten. The recognition that came with the award served as a reminder that they were not alone and that their fight for democracy and human rights was valid. Aung San Suu Kyi also reflected on the lessons of war, specifically citing the First World War as a \\"terrifying waste of youth and potential.\\" She noted with sorrow that despite the passage of years, humanity was still guilty of recklessness and improvidence, failing to address the causes of suffering and violence. By underscoring the importance of understanding the root causes of war, her speech urged the world to act towards promoting peace, justice, and sustainable growth for everyone. One of the main points of her speech was the significance of human suffering and its role in engendering conflict. Where suffering is ignored, it degrades and enrages people, sowing the seeds for conflict and further suffering. Aung San Suu Kyi emphasized the need to be empathetic and proactive in alleviating human suffering as a way to prevent violence and ensure lasting peace. The concept of 'absolute peace' might have been considered an unattainable goal, but Aung San Suu Kyi's speech painted a vision of hope and perseverance. She likened humanity's quest for peace to a traveler in a desert, constantly striving for the guiding star that would lead them to salvation. Her unwavering belief in the possibility of peace served as a call to action for all to persist in their pursuits for justice and equality. Lastly, Aung San Suu Kyi extolled the virtue of kindness. She spoke of the kindness she had received during her years of house arrest, highlighting that even the smallest acts of kindness had convinced her of the profound impact it could have on the world. Her speech served as a reminder of the lesson she had learned amidst her struggles: that there could never be enough kindness in the world. As we look back on this remarkable speech, we are reminded of Aung San Suu Kyi's enduring commitment to democracy and human rights. Her words continue to resonate, inspiring not only the people of Burma but everyone working towards a more just and equitable world. The fight for democracy, the alleviation of human suffering, and the importance of kindness will remain relevant as long as conflict and injustice persist. And as Aung San Suu Kyi demonstrated through her resilience, it is important for each of us to contribute, in our own way, to creating a world that is fair and kind to everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Timothy F. Geithner Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Timothy F. Geithner is already written in English, but let me provide you with a detailed background about him. Timothy Franz Geithner (born August 18, 1961) is an American financial expert and economic policy-maker who was the 75th United States Secretary of the Treasury, serving from January 2009 to January 2013. He worked closely with then-President Barack Obama and led the economic team that navigated the United States through challenging times, such as the global financial crisis. Geithner was born in Brooklyn, New York, but spent much of his childhood traveling and living in different countries due to his father's work. He attended several international schools, which exposed him to a diverse range of cultures and ideas. He would later use these experiences to inform his approach to international economic policy. Geithner studied at Dartmouth College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government and Asian studies in 1983. He then obtained a Master of Arts in international economics and East Asian studies from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in 1985. His academic background focused on both economics and international relations. After completing his education, Geithner joined the Treasury Department in 1988. He held various roles, including the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Monetary and Financial Policy, Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. In these roles, he was involved in policy formulation and implementation, particularly related to international trade, financial regulation, and crisis response initiatives. In 2001, Geithner left the Treasury Department and joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as Director of the Policy Development and Review Department. In this position, he tackled financial crises impacting developing nations and helped craft policies to improve global economic stability. Geithner's tenure as the ninth President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began in November 2003, where he played a leading role in designing and implementing the Central Bank's response to the financial crisis that began in 2007. In this role, he became well-acquainted with both the public and private sides of the financial system, which enabled him to identify potential vulnerabilities and work towards devising solutions. In January 2009, Timothy F. Geithner was sworn in as the 75th Secretary of the Treasury. As part of President Obama's economic team, Geithner led the government's efforts to restore stability to financial markets, address the housing crisis, and assist the auto industry in transitioning to a more sustainable future. He also played a key role in the design and implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aimed to prevent future financial crises. Following his tenure as Treasury Secretary, Geithner has continued to contribute to the world of finance, policy, and international relations in various roles, including becoming President of Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm, in 2014. In summary, Timothy F. Geithner is a highly accomplished economic policy-maker whose career has encompassed roles in academia, government, and the private sector. His expertise in international economics and financial regulation has positioned him as a key figure in shaping and implementing policies that have had enduring effects on the U.S. and global economy."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film starts with Graeme Obree (Miller), who suffers from crippling bipolar disorder, cycling into a wood where he prepares to hang himself. A flashback to Obree's (Sean Brown) childhood depicts him being physically attacked at school by other pupils, leaving severe psychological scars. One day Obree is given a bicycle by his parents and we see Obree evading the bullies on his bike. The adult Obree is married with a child. While competing in local races, he runs a failing cycle shop and has to supplement his income as a bicycle courier. Baxter (Cox), a boatyard owner who is (unbeknownst to Obree) a minister, befriends the atheist Obree. Obree decides to try and beat the hour record. He has neither the funding nor the quality of bicycle required. Determined to succeed, he constructs \\"Old Faithful\\", a revolutionary bicycle designed by Obree for maximum efficiency, made up from scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With help from his friend and manager Malky McGovern (Boyd), Obree plans to break the world record in Norway. His first attempt is a failure, but he tries again the following morning and succeeds. His victory is short-lived, and his record is broken by Chris Boardman (Adrian Grove (credited as Adrian Smith)) a week later. The Union Cycliste Internationale changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle. Obree is severely depressed the night following his record-making ride. This is exacerbated when Boardman breaks the record. When Obree is confronted in a pub by the four bullies who had victimised him years earlier at school, he becomes completely withdrawn and rarely leaves his house. Baxter attempts to counsel him, but Obree feels betrayed when he discovers that Baxter is the pastor of a local church. He recovers enough to compete in the Individual Pursuit World Championship in 1993, in which he uses his bicycle design again. The UCI officials begin rigorously enforcing the new ruling, penalizing him for riding in the stance that his bicycle design is...

The Sentence: \\"What I wish I looked like on a horse.\\" 2. Eliminate Stop Words: Stop words in English include words such as 'what', 'i', a', 'on'. These are generic words that don't add much value in understanding the main subjects or actions in the sentence. After removing these, we're left with 'wish', 'looked', 'like', 'horse'. 3. Identify Key Words: Among the remaining words, we'll focus on ones that capture the most significant concepts or actions. In the current context, \\"wish\\", \\"looked\\", \\"like\\", and \\"horse\\" are important words. - \\"Wish\\" reveals a want or desire. - \\"Looked\\" and \\"like\\" together indicate a comparison or aspiration about the speaker's appearance. - \\"Horse\\" is the key subject matter the rest of the sentence depends upon.

Write the answer: The Crystal Palace was re-erected on which hill in South London after the Great Exhibition of 1851?","completion":"The Crystal Palace, an impressive cast-iron and plate-glass building, was initially built for and served as the centerpiece of the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park. It was an exhibition organized by Prince Albert and Sir Henry Cole to showcase the cultural and technological achievements of the United Kingdom and other nations. Following the success of the Great Exhibition, it was decided to relocate the Crystal Palace to a more permanent site, and the chosen location for this purpose was Sydenham Hill in South London. Sydenham Hill, a high ridge in South London, was considered an ideal site for the Crystal Palace for several reasons. First, the elevation of the hill provided a panoramic view of London, offering a striking position for the magnificent structure. Second, the surrounding area was predominantly open and undeveloped, which lent itself well to the creation of the park, gardens, and other attractions planned for the new location. Third, the site's proximity to London allowed for the development of railway lines and stations to facilitate visitor access. The relocation and reconstruction process of the Crystal Palace on Sydenham Hill commenced in 1852 and was concluded in 1854. Sir Joseph Paxton, the original architect, modified the design of the building to better suit the new site. The revised design consisted of a central transept which was taller and larger than the original version, and it expanded the overall dimensions of the building. The new Crystal Palace was constructed mainly using components from the original Hyde Park structure, with additional cast iron and plate glass. Extensive landscaping and the creation of spectacular gardens surrounded the building to enhance its appeal further. Upon its reopening on 10th June 1854 by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Crystal Palace became an iconic entertainment, cultural, and educational venue in South London. It housed numerous art exhibitions, concerts, sporting events, and showcased innovations in technology, such as the first ever public display of electric lighting in 1856. The park grounds also featured a series of life-sized dinosaur sculptures, showcasing the relatively new field of paleontology. Moreover, the development of the area contributed significantly to the growth of new residential neighborhoods and the emergence of various railway lines and stations. Unfortunately, the Crystal Palace met a tragic end in 1936 when it was destroyed in a fire. Despite its loss, the name 'Crystal Palace' has remained significant in the local area, currently referencing a district in South London, as well as several nearby landmarks such as the Crystal Palace Park and the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. The architectural marvel and its rich history continue to hold a special place in the hearts of Londoners and those who celebrate the cultural and technological accomplishments of the Victorian era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Being exposed to wind can cause erosion of soil, and on bare, dry soil, wind erosion can remove significant quantities of topsoil. Given these facts, what enhances the effects of erosion among the following options: - less wind - dry soil - coastlines - flooding - rivers - streams - increase in top soil - mulch","completion":"Wind erosion is a significant problem, especially in arid regions where vegetation is scarce, and the topsoil can easily be blown away by strong winds. Among the given options, some factors can enhance the effects of erosion or lead to different types of erosion. Let's delve into each option and analyze their influence on erosion. 1. Less wind: Less wind is a factor that would actually reduce the effects of wind erosion. Wind is a primary cause of erosion, specifically aeolian processes, and as wind speed decreases, the transportation capacity of soil particles decreases as well. 2. Dry soil: Dry soil can indeed enhance the effects of wind erosion. When the soil moisture content is low, the soil particles are not held together by water, and the soil's overall structure weakens, making it more susceptible to being picked up and moved by the wind. 3. Coastlines: Coastlines can also experience erosion, but it is primarily due to wave action, tidal movements, and coastal currents, rather than wind. Coastal erosion can be exacerbated in areas experiencing frequent storms or sea-level rise. While wind can contribute to erosion at coastlines, the main factors are usually water-related. 4. Flooding: Flooding is another factor that can contribute to erosion, but it is more related to water erosion rather than wind erosion. During floods, large amounts of water flow over the landscape, removing soil particles and other sediment in the process. This sudden movement can lead to significant erosion, especially in areas lacking adequate vegetation or plant cover to protect the soil. 5. Rivers: Rivers, similar to flooding, deal primarily with water erosion rather than wind erosion. The constant flow of water in a river can lead to continuous erosion of riverbanks and surrounding landscapes. The intensity of the erosion depends on various factors such as the river's velocity, volume, geology of the surrounding area, and human interventions, such as construction and land use. 6. Streams: Streams, like rivers, are associated with water erosion rather than wind erosion. Erosion from streamflow can lead to the formation of meanders or the carving of deep gullies in the landscape. Stream erosion is influenced by factors such as stream velocity, volume, sediment composition, and natural or human-made alterations to the stream's course. 7. Increase in topsoil: An increase in topsoil typically reduces the effects of erosion, as a thicker layer of nutrient-rich soil is more resistant to being eroded when roots of vegetation or small microorganisms are bound to the soil, making it more stable. However, in the case of wind erosion, increasing the topsoil's depth without any means to anchor the soil, such as vegetation or moisture, might still lead to soil loss. 8. Mulch: The addition of mulch to the soil surface can help reduce erosion. Mulch covers the soil surface, shielding it from direct contact with wind and water, thus reducing surface runoff and wind-related soil displacement. By covering the soil, mulch also promotes moisture retention, which strengthens the soil's structure and prevents it from being easily eroded by wind. In conclusion, among the given options, factors such as dry soil, coastlines (specifically through water erosion), flooding, rivers, and streams can enhance the effects of erosion, while less wind, increase in topsoil, and mulch may contribute to erosion prevention or reduction. It is essential to consider site conditions, climate, and overall landscape when discussing erosion to understand the complex interplay of factors involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The changes in the park's environment may cause alterations in the habitat's overall structure, leading to shifts in the specific distributions of species. As the park becomes more arid, the animals residing within it will need to adapt to their new circumstances in different ways. Firstly, there will likely be a decline in overall species diversity in the park, as some animals that are more dependent on water may not be able to survive the increasingly dry conditions. These water-dependent species may include amphibians, such as frogs and salamanders, which rely on moist habitats for reproduction and overall survival. Additionally, certain plants and trees that require a lot of water to grow – for instance, large deciduous trees – may die out or become less abundant, which can, in turn, affect various animal species that depend on the trees for food and shelter. Animals in the park will also face increased competition for the limited water resources. For instance, watering holes and other natural water sources will become increasingly scarce, and as a result, animals will be forced to travel farther to reach them. Consequently, some species may see a reduction in their populations due to intensified competition for water. This competition can also lead to increased aggression between different species, as well as within species, as they try to access the dwindling water supplies. To adapt to the changing conditions, some animals may alter their behaviors and diets. For instance, herbivores that rely on moist vegetation for sustenance may start consuming more drought-resistant plants, like cacti and succulents. On the other hand, predators may need to change their hunting strategies, as their prey becomes more dispersed or changes their habits due to the arid environment. Furthermore, some animals may become more nocturnal, staying active during the cooler and more humid nighttime hours to avoid the intense heat and dryness of the day, which could aggravate water loss in their bodies. The overall carrying capacity of the park will also likely be affected as a result of the increased aridity. Carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals of a particular species that can be sustained in a given habitat. With reduced available water and potentially less diverse vegetation, the capacity to support large populations of animals may decline, leading to reduced numbers of certain species or even local extinction. Finally, as the park's aridity increases, migration may become an essential survival strategy for some species. Animals that are unable to adapt or maintain their homeostasis in the increasingly harsh conditions might seek out new environments with more favorable conditions, effectively abandoning the park. In turn, this migration may affect other ecosystems as the animals may introduce new competition or predation pressures upon arrival in their new habitats. In conclusion, as the park becomes more arid and available water resources decrease, we can expect to see a variety of consequences for the animals that inhabit the area. These may include a decline in species diversity, increased competition and aggression for remaining water sources, behavioral and dietary changes, a reduced carrying capacity, and potential migration to more favorable habitats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How did the Cynics reject this?\\" Context: \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.\\" Answer:","completion":"The Cynics, with Diogenes of Sinope as one of their most notable figures, rejected public offices and civic service in a way that challenged the traditional societal norms that shaped the Greek world. Their approach to life focused on living in harmony with nature and according to a simple and self-sufficient lifestyle. They believed that this way of life was essential for achieving eudaimonia, or true happiness and well-being. In this context, the Cynics rejected the polis, the Greek political establishment and its institutions, as they found them to be unnatural and unnecessary. They believed that such structures only served to distract individuals from a life of virtue and happiness. By rejecting these institutions, they also rejected the societal conventions (nomos) that these political structures supported. The Cynics' disdain for material possessions was emblematic of their larger philosophical worldview. They believed that the accumulation of wealth and status were detrimental to true happiness and that only a life free from such trappings could lead to ultimate contentment. Consequently, they denounced the materialism and consumerism that were prevalent in Greek society and chose to live in poverty as a means of rejecting materialistic values. Diogenes of Sinope, for instance, famously lived in a large ceramic jar called a pithos, demonstrating that even the most basic shelter was sufficient for human needs. These principles also extended to their views on education and intellectual pursuits. The Cynics were critical of other philosophical schools, such as the Epicureans, Stoics, and those that continued the traditions of Aristotle and Plato, for their perceived intellectual arrogance and elitism. In rejecting civic involvement, material possessions, and social norms, the Cynics sought to underscore the importance of focusing on the cultivation of inner virtue and the pursuit of a simpler life free from the distractions and artificiality of societal pressures. Their radical rejection of the polis and its institutions represented a challenge to the conventional wisdom of the time and provided an alternative vision of what a truly fulfilled life looked like."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It has an area of , nearly 10 percent of which is fresh water, composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - In geography, statistics and archaeology, a settlement, locality or populated place is a community in which people live. A settlement can range in size from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Settlements may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities. A settlement may have known historical properties such as the date or era in which it was first settled, or first settled by a particular people. - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - The vastness of Canada's Northwest Territories (spelled 'North-West Territories' from 1870 to 1905) meant that for much of its history it was divided into several districts for ease of administration.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the specific category of drilling fluid that includes includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene? ? Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

Given the question: Given the following passage \\"Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).\\", answer the following question.

Hint: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. A:","completion":"In case B, the number of mesopredators would be more than in case A. The decrease in the number of Siberian tigers (apex predators) due to the introduction of guns would lead to a phenomenon known as mesopredator release. This occurs when the removal or reduction of top-level predators allows mesopredator populations to grow in size. Thus, with fewer apex predators like the Siberian tiger to control their numbers, the populations of mesopredators would increase."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches.\\" be a reasonable answer? Choose from: (A). No; (B). Yes; Answer:","completion":"(A). No; A detailed and long answer: World War 1, also known as the First World War or the Great War, began on July 28, 1914, and lasted until November 11, 1918. The direct cause of the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. To understand the deeper causes that led to the war, it is essential to understand the complex web of political, economic, and colonial rivalries among European powers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key factors that contributed to the conflict's origins include militarism, imperial ambitions, nationalism, and the alliance system formed by European powers at the time. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand set off a series of events that led to an escalation of tensions among the major European powers. Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand's empire, held Serbia responsible for the assassination and issued an ultimatum, which Serbia did not fully comply with. Consequently, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. This act set off a chain reaction that led to various other countries entering the conflict, due to the existing political alliances and treaties. Russia, having a pact to protect Serbia, began mobilizing its forces against Austria-Hungary and its ally, Germany. Germany, obligated by its alliance with Austria-Hungary, then declared war on Russia on August 1, 1914. Just two days later, Germany declared war on Russia's ally, France, and launched an invasion of Belgium to outflank French forces. This, in turn, led to Great Britain, protector of Belgian neutrality, declaring war on Germany on August 4, 1914. From this point on, the conflict escalated into a full-scale war, involving many nations across the globe. The opposing sides in the war were the Allies, which primarily consisted of Russia, France, Great Britain, Italy, and the United States, and the Central Powers, including Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. It is important to note that the quote provided, \\"After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches,\\" describes an event that took place towards the end of World War 1, rather than the beginning. This quote refers to the crucial period during 1918 when the tide began to turn against Germany and ultimately led to the end of the war. In conclusion, the starting point of World War 1 can be attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent series of political events that culminated in a global conflict involving many nations. The provided quote is not a reasonable answer to the question, as it describes events that occurred towards the end of the war, rather than its origin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If bushes detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness, then what detects and responds to the daily cycle of light and darkness? Answer choices: - fens - apples - oxygen - Oak - gravity - amoeba - earth's rotation - bushes Answer:","completion":"Bushes detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. This is due to their intrinsic biological processes known as circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms are driven by internal biological clocks found in plants and animals, including humans. These biological clocks regulate various physiological, developmental, metabolic, and behavioral processes that enable organisms to synchronize with the environment's daily fluctuations, such as light and darkness, temperature, and resource availability. In plants, such as bushes, light is the primary environmental cue that entrains the circadian rhythms. The detection and response to the daily cycle of light and darkness occur mainly through specialized photoreceptor proteins known as photoreceptors. These photoreceptors absorb particular wavelengths of light and transmit the information to the plant's internal biological clock, located in the cells. Five types of photoreceptors have been identified in plants: phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, ZEITLUPE family proteins, and UVR8. These photoreceptors work collaboratively or independently to regulate various light-dependent processes, including germination, growth, flowering, stomatal regulation, and photosynthesis. For example, phytochromes play a critical role in detecting and responding to changes in red and far-red light, influencing seed germination and vegetative development. Cryptochromes and phototropins, on the other hand, perceive blue and ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light, regulating responses like phototropism (growth towards the light source) and the opening of stomata for gas exchange and transpiration. Once the photoreceptors perceive the light signals, they undergo conformational changes and initiate signal transduction pathways within the plant's cells. These pathways modulate the activity of various circadian clock components, ensuring the synchronization of the internal clock with the external environment. Subsequently, the circadian clock regulates the expression of clock-controlled genes (CCGs), which coordinate essential physiological processes, enabling plants to adapt to the daily light-dark cycle. To summarize, bushes detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness primarily through their intrinsic circadian rhythm mechanisms. Photoreceptors in the plant cells absorb specific wavelengths of light, transmitting this information to the internal biological clock to synchronize the plant's physiological processes with the daily fluctuations in the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: This is part two of a four part series on Inner Wisdom Eating (IWE) The 4 steps of Inner Wisdom Eating (or eating like a thin person) are exactly the same as those promoted by Intuitive Eating. Eat when you’re hungry Eat what you want Eat consciously Stop when you are full The difference lies in the approach and the detail. I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel. YOU CAN STILL EAT DIET FOOD Low fat ice-cream, Diet Coke and protein powder are still in my diet but I eat them because I prefer the taste over their ‘real’ counterparts. I can still ask for dressing on the side and no butter on my sandwich not because I’m counting calories but because I can’t see the point in eating food I don’t actually want. Question: How frequently is the author likely to go on strict diets? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Never B: Occasionally C: Frequently D: Always Step 1: Understand the context. The passage is about Inner Wisdom Eating (IWE), a method for eating that emphasizes listening to your body's needs and desires, similar to Intuitive Eating. The main focus is on eating without restrictions or assigning value to certain foods. Step 2: Find clues in the text. The author states, \\"There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods.\\" and \\"There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation.\\" They also mention that they eat mostly unprocessed food because they love the taste and prefer how it makes them feel, not because it's \\"good.\\" Step 3: Evaluate answer options. A: Never - This seems to be the most likely option given the author's emphasis on not restricting food or assigning value to certain foods, and enjoying favorite indulgences in moderation. B: Occasionally - This option may not accurately reflect the author's approach as it implies some level of dieting. C: Frequently - This option contradicts the passage's main message of not assigning value to foods and eating without restrictions. D: Always - This option is the opposite of what the author endorses in the passage. Step 4: Choose the best answer. The best answer is A: Never, as the author's approach to Inner Wisdom Eating avoids strict diets and instead focuses on listening to the body's needs and desires without imposing unnecessary restrictions on food choices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: The bilirubin production system can run into trouble at one of three points: before, during, and after bilirubin production. Each of these problems can result from a set of related conditions: Adults can develop what is called \\"unconjugated jaundice\\" when the problem occurs before bilirubin is produced. This is most often caused by reabsorption of a large blood clot or by hemolytic anemia. During the production of bilirubin, adults can develop jaundice as a result of viruses such as hepatitis and Epstein-Barr, autoimmune disorders, and overconsumption of alcohol or certain medications including acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, and steroids. If the adult develops jaundice because of problems after bilirubin production, the problem may lie in the gallbladder or pancreas. If you have jaundice, you will want to have your bilirubin levels checked. Jaundice can be an indication of a serious health issue. Usually, your doctor will work to find and treat the cause of your jaundice and treat any complications of the jaundice. The jaundice itself is not usually treated. Sometimes a medication may be given to help with itching, which is a common symptom of jaundice. Jaundice is often accompanied by other symptoms, which may help your doctor determine the cause: Short term jaundice, which is caused by infection, may be accompanied by chills, fever, abdominal discomfort, or other flu-like symptoms. Jaundice caused by cholestasis -- the interruption of the flow of bile -- may be accompanied by itching, weight loss, darkened urine, or lightened stools. A number of uncommon medical disorders can lead to elevated bilirubin and jaundice. Gilbert syndrome is a genetic liver disorder. Patients have a reduced amount of the liver enzyme needed to break down bilirubin. Although present from birth, symptoms, which include jaundice, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal discomfort, may not appear until young adulthood. Crigler-Najjar disease is an extremely rare condition that is also caused by an enzyme deficiency. There are two types of this disease; the more common one, called Arias' syndrome, can be treated so that patients can live a normal or near-normal lifespan. People with sickle cell anemia or other blood disorders also have a higher risk of jaundice. Alcohol can damage the liver, which leads to increased bilirubin levels, so limit your consumption to the recommended daily allowance (1-2 drinks per day depending on your age). Some people may be advised to completely eliminate alcohol consumption. Alcohol can damage the liver in three ways: By leaving excess fat in liver cells. This condition is known as fatty liver disease. Many people who have this condition do not experience symptoms, but those who do may experience discomfort and fatigue. By causing scarring and inflammation of the liver. These symptoms may indicate alcoholic hepatitis. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Alcoholic hepatitis can sometimes be reversed by abstaining from alcohol. This can also be caused by viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. By disrupting the functioning of the liver. Cirrhosis of the liver is characterized by severe scarring of the liver and disruption of its ability to process food and to remove harmful substances from the blood. Studies have shown that obesity can be more damaging to the liver than alcohol consumption. Obesity can lead to fatty liver, even in children. Foods that are high in fiber are particularly good for the liver, including fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Certain foods are more likely to damage the liver, including those high in fat, sugar, or salt. Other foods that may damage the liver include fried food and raw or undercooked shellfish. Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viruses that negatively affect the liver. Avoid contracting the disease by taking precautions: Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for everyone starting shortly after birth. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for certain high-risk people or those traveling to high-risk areas. If you are traveling to areas of the world with high rates of hepatitis, get vaccinated before leaving. Hepatitis can also be contracted through risky behaviors such as intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. Be aware that some medications, including over-the-counter pain medication and common prescription drugs such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, antibiotics, and anabolic steroids, can cause toxic hepatitis. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure if you are taking medications that may be harming your liver. Some alternative medicines thought to improve liver health and function have actually been linked to liver damage. Consult your doctor before taking alternative medicines. Some of the commonly used herbs that can damage your liver include green tea, kava, comfrey, mistletoe, Chaparral, and skullcap. The liver is responsible for breaking down medications, and it is possible for them to cause damage during this process. Acetaminophen is the most commonly used over the counter medication that can damage the liver.","completion":"The bilirubin production system can face issues at three stages: before, during, and after production, resulting in jaundice. Unconjugated jaundice occurs before production, usually caused by reabsorption of large blood clots or hemolytic anemia. During production, jaundice may be due to viruses, autoimmune disorders, or overconsumption of certain substances. Post-production, gallbladder or pancreas issues may be the cause. Jaundice is often a symptom of a serious health issue, and it's important to monitor bilirubin levels. Several rare medical disorders like Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar disease can cause elevated bilirubin and jaundice. People with blood disorders like sickle cell anemia are also at risk. Limiting alcohol consumption is crucial, as it can damage the liver, leading to increased bilirubin levels. Obesity, certain foods, and hepatitis can also negatively affect the liver. It is essential to take precautions, ensure vaccines are up to date, and be cautious when using medications or alternative medicines that could harm the liver, such as acetaminophen and certain herbs. Consulting a doctor regularly to assess liver health is highly recommended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the 23rd century, Starship C-57D reaches the distant planet Altair IV to determine the fate of a 20-year-old expedition. Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the expedition's scientists, contacts the Earth ship. He states no assistance is required, warning the starship not to land; he cannot guarantee their safety. Commander John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) insists on landing co-ordinates. Adams, Lieutenant Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly), and Lieutenant \\"Doc\\" Ostrow (Warren Stevens) are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius' residence. There, Morbius claims that an unknown \\"planetary force\\" killed nearly everyone and finally vaporized their starship, the Bellerophon, as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes) and their daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) were somehow immune. Morbius fears that the Earthmen are in danger, and (silently) that Altaira is intrigued by them. The next day, Adams finds Farman educating Altaira on kissing; furious, he dismisses Farman and berates Altaira for her naivety and revealing clothes. Altaira is frustrated, but designs a new, more conservative dress to please Adams. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages equipment aboard the starship.

The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.

He comes to a red light and sees the car next to him is an expensive looking Honda Civic, owned by a man named Alejandro. Jacob and Alejandro agree to race, and when the light turns green they both slam their feet on the gas pedal and take off. Jacob's car arrives at the light pole down the street from the light sooner than Alejandro's car, and he wins the race. But I can use this background: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. What is an answer for this question: Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated slower? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower. Since acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object, and velocity measures both speed and direction, we can determine that the car which reached the finish line (light pole down the street) later must have experienced a slower acceleration. In this street race, Jacob's car arrived at the light pole sooner than Alejandro's car, which means Jacob's car must have had a higher acceleration rate, allowing it to cover the distance faster.

The design was intricate, with delicate filigree work surrounding the gemstone and shimmering diamonds that lined the edges.

She would imagine herself wearing them to various events, feeling elegant and turning heads with her exquisite choice in accessories. Christine, her dearest friend, knew how much Rebecca longed for these earrings. They had known each other since they were little girls, and practically grew up together. Over the years, they had endured life's ups and downs, created countless memories, and forged an unbreakable bond. They were practically inseparable and understood each other like no one else. One day, as they were taking a walk through the city, Christine felt a sudden urge to do something special for her best friend. She wanted to show her appreciation for all the love and support Rebecca had given her throughout their years of friendship. They had shared so much laughter, tears, and joy together, and Christine decided it was time to repay the kindness in her own way. As they approached the familiar jewelry store, Christine could see the anticipation in Rebecca's eyes. However, this time, Christine had a plan. She reached into her purse and pulled out her wallet, taking out a significant amount of cash. With a bright smile on her face, she offered it to Rebecca. \\"Here, take this, and go buy those earrings you've always wanted,\\" Christine said with a warmhearted sincerity that would melt even the hardest of hearts. Rebecca's eyes widened in shock, she couldn't believe what she was hearing.

She knew that their friendship was priceless, and she couldn't have asked for a better person to share her life with. As they entered the store, hand in hand, Rebecca carefully chose the earrings she had been dreaming of for so long. After the purchase was completed, she wore them right away, and both friends marveled at how the earrings indeed brought out the beauty of her eyes.

Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification of textual variants in either manuscripts or printed books. Ancient scribes made alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text (the archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or recensions, of a document's transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic's work is the production of a \\"critical edition\\" containing a scholarly curated text. Many ancient works, such as the Bible and the Greek tragedies,[citation needed] survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear. Textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original, hence which readings in those sources are correct.[citation needed] Although biblical books that are letters, like Greek plays, presumably had one original, the question of whether some biblical books, like the Gospels, ever had just one original has been discussed. Interest in applying textual criticism to the Qur'an has also developed after the discovery of the Sana'a manuscripts in 1972, which possibly date back to the 7–8th centuries. 1.

North Korea has said that Typhoon Bolaven, a powerful tropical cyclone that pounded the Korean Peninsula last week, killed 48 people in the country and left more than 21,000 homeless. The storm also injured more than 50 people and destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of crops, according to a report published Monday evening by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The secretive, militaristic North Korean regime has repeatedly asked for food aid from international aid organizations as it struggles to feed its own people after suffering extensive famines during the 1990s. Employees from humanitarian groups that operate inside North Korea have described severe malnourishment on a large scale. A deal earlier this year for the United States to ship food aid to the country fell apart after the authoritarian regime in Pyongyang went ahead with a controversial rocket launch. North Korea already experienced widespread devastation in late July from heavy rains and flooding. KCNA said the extreme weather resulted in the deaths of at least 169 people and left more than 200,000 homeless. The United Nations World Food Program called it an emergency and organized for emergency food aid to be delivered. North Korea then took the unusual step of releasing footage of the devastated areas, showing houses submerged and farmlands destroyed. The damage caused by Bolaven last week has now added to the woes of the North Korean population.

News article: Big changes are coming (again) to the SAT, the once almighty college admissions test that was overtaken in popularity by the ACT. The essay portion of the exam, added in 2005 with great fanfare as a crucial new part of the exam, is now being made optional, because apparently, it wasn’t all that crucial after all. And those silly vocabulary words that nobody ever needed to know except for the SAT (and weren’t on the ACT) are being dumped. Students will also no longer lose a quarter point for every wrong answer to multiple-choice questions (just as they don’t on the ACT). The College Board doth protest, but doesn’t it sound like the SAT is trying to be more like the ACT? In this story about the SAT changes, my colleague Nick Anderson quoted Shirley Ort, a top financial aid official at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and vice chair of the College Board’s governing board, as saying: “We’re not just chasing market share here, I can assure you that. We want the SAT to be more than just an event that takes place in a test center. We think it can serve as a catalyst for student engagement.” Sure thing. Considering that the ACT has long been seen as the exam that covers high school curriculum better and has less “tricks” than the SAT, this could be perceived as a useful turn of events. Still, a big problem for the College Board remains: The changes to the SAT aren’t likely to make it any more of an accurate predictor of how well students will do in college than it was before. And before, it wasn’t any good at it at all. It wasn’t predictive of anything. The changes won’t take away from the fact that no single standardized test score should be used for a high-stakes decisions involving young students — not for student promotion from grade to grade, high school graduation, etc. Some kids are simply better taking tests than others, some kids are sick when they take them, and historically, the scores are as reflective of the socio-economic divide in the country than they are of anything. Kids who live in poverty do worse than kids who don’t. The new test won’t change any of that, according to Bob Schaeffer, public education director of the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), a nonprofit group dedicated to ending the misuse of standardized test scores. It also won’t be any “less susceptible” to coaching by tutoring companies, he said. As part of its SAT changes, the College Board also said that it was making SAT test prep free for all students. Is that the end of the multimillion-dollar test prep industry? Not likely. There already are free test prep options, and many families won’t think they are getting good test prep unless they pay a lot of money for it. FairTest maintains an ever-growing list of more than 800 colleges and universities that don’t require ACT or SAT scores. Research shows that test-option admissions don’t hurt colleges a bit in their admissions processes and may help expand diversity and academic quality, Schaeffer said, adding: ||||| The announcement that the College Board will give the SAT a makeover, the first revamp in a decade, is a welcome step toward the ultimate transformation: an end to the college entrance exam. The test changes, which go into effect in 2016, include returning the test to its original 1600 grading scale (the current 2400-point scale was introduced in 2005), scrapping fancy vocabulary words and axing mandatory essays. The changes will shorten the exam by 45 minutes, to 3 hours. And it will likely be taken online. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT The updated exam will ask students to support their answers in the reading section with evidence from the passages. The math topics will have a narrower focus; calculators will be used for only some math sections. The only thing the SAT measures is how well a student does on the SAT. I have been a volunteer SAT tutor to dozens of students in New York City's public high schools. Many of the students I work with live below the poverty line; most will be the first person in their family to attend college. Some have autism; others are homeless. I tutor to help level the playing field. I tutor because education is relevant; it is the great equalizer. Education is a chance for the son of an insurance broker to grow up and lead the nonprofit College Board and earn 1.3 million a year, more than the president of Harvard. The changes being planned by the College Board include a partnership with educational website Khan Academy, which will offer free online SAT prep courses. It will likely deliver a crushing blow to companies like Kaplan and Princeton Review, which are at the center of the 1 billion test-prep industry. Test preparation is not the problem. The techniques I teach my students are effective in gaming the SAT; the \\"tricks\\" actually help students do better on the exam and raise their score by hundreds of points. Still, none of the test skills will help them in college. A professor will give them more than 25 minutes to write an essay, and they will not need to answer five multiple-choice questions in just seconds on how the Laffer curve measures prison populations. The greater problem is that the nation’s high schools are not properly preparing students to develop the intellectual firepower to get through college. Those who are graduating will tackle the SAT, which is the equivalent of judging every student by their ability to swim a mile. And they’re drowning. In New York City, the high school graduation rate is 60 percent. Chicago’s is 65 percent. In Los Angeles, 66 percent of students graduate from high school. The SAT is irrelevant. The test cannot measure the real-world success of students: the fashionista whose designs are worthy of a runway show; the potential social worker who visits the elderly; the future salon owner who is already earning income cutting hair for friends; the powerful stroke of a champion swimmer. The only thing the SAT measures is how well a student does on the SAT. An SAT essay finished in 25 minutes -- which must be written in long-hand, using a No. 2 pencil -- cannot signal a student's ability to write an insightful university term paper. One SAT section gives students 10 minutes to answer 14 questions. Do the math -- that's 43 seconds per question, to read, figure out, and then shade-in the tiny bubble on an answer sheet. For the student who needs help with geometry or who may take an hour to write just a few paragraphs, the test's rapid-fire model brings self-doubt and anxiety. It sets up students to fail. The only meaningful change will come when higher education officials acknowledge that a high school transcript, school attendance, teacher/coach recommendations, extracurricular activities, volunteer work, internships, jobs and interviews are the best gauge for whether a student will succeed in college. Lion Calandra, a Senior Editor at FoxNews.com, has been a volunteer SAT tutor in New York City's public high schools since 2007. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Major changes are coming to the SAT, a widely-used college admissions test in the United States.

The second segment is a spoof of \\"sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry\\" movies.

After his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher.

Article: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile. Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953.

Article: Gingrich’s emergence is the latest dramatic shift in the GOP contest that have made front-runners out of a series of contenders only to have them fall quickly back into the pack. Dan Balz discussed this article with readers Tuesday at 11 a.m. ET. Read the chat transcript now. Gingrich’s campaign was considered all but dead only a few months ago. The question now is whether he can capi­tal­ize on his current strengths to make himself a lasting contender. His support in national polls has been steadily increasing, and a victory in Iowa would probably give him a boost in the next two states to hold elections: New Hampshire, where he has been closing in on Romney, and South Carolina. A separate poll of South Carolina voters, by Winthrop University, shows Gingrich ahead of Romney in that bellwether state 38 percent to 22 percent. But Romney’s advisers think they have the money and infrastructure to wage a protracted campaign even if he loses two of the first three states. No Republican has done that in the modern era, but the rules are different this year because some states will distribute delegates proportionally. With 33 percent support among likely caucus-goers in the new poll, Gingrich runs well ahead of his two main rivals, Romney and Paul, a libertarian whose passionate following and anti-government rhetoric have made him a durable force in the race. Both are at 18 percent. But Iowa Republicans are far from decided. More than six in 10 potential caucus-goers say they could change their minds, and even among the likeliest attendees, fewer than half say they have definitely chosen a candidate. Of the top three, Paul’s supporters are the most solid, followed by Gingrich’s and Romney’s. Beyond the leaders, only Texas Gov. Rick Perry scores in the double digits, with 11 percent. Two candidates who have devoted as much or more time as any to the state — Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) — are in the single digits, at 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Running last among the major candidates is former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr., with 2 percent. Huntsman has staked his candidacy on a strong finish in New Hampshire. The survey was conducted Wednesday through Sunday, with all interviews following the latest allegations of sexual impropriety against businessman Cain and the candidate’s declaration that he was “reassessing” his candidacy. ||||| Craig Ruttle/AP Photo Newt Gingrich has leapt to a sizable lead in preferences for the Iowa Republican caucuses, drawing on a rally from conservatives, positive views of his political experience and a sense he best represents \\"core Republican values\\" to push Mitt Romney into a trailing tie with Ron Paul. Gingrich also scores evenly with Romney as the candidate best able to defeat Barack Obama, a mantle Romney long has sought. And this ABC News/Washington Post poll finds Gingrich ahead of the GOP field in trust to handle the economy, the top issue in Iowa, as it is nationally. Given these views, 33 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers currently favor Gingrich for the GOP nomination, with 18 percent apiece for Romney and Paul. Rick Perry garners 11 percent support; Michele Bachmann, 8; Rick Santorum, 7; and Jon Huntsman, 2 percent. There's room for movement. Just over half of likely caucus-goers, 52 percent, say there's a chance they may yet change their minds before the Jan. 3 event. Indeed, about one in four, 27 percent, say there's a \\"good chance\\" they'll switch their first preference - more than enough to shift the standings if the bulk of them were to move in the same direction. In Iowa, as nationally, Gingrich's fortunes reflect the restlessness of conservative Republicans as they've sought an alternative to Romney. Support for Romney craters to just 11 percent among \\"very\\" conservative voters - a dominant group in the caucuses, accounting for more than four in 10 likely participants. Romney inches to 19 percent support among \\"somewhat\\" conservatives in Iowa, still trailing Gingrich. Only among moderates (and the few liberals) does Romney pull into competition. But they're far too few in number to make up for his conservative shortfall. Romney's also vulnerable in another area: He faces a significant loyalty gap, in which his supporters are disproportionately likely to say they may change their minds. Paul's backers, by contrast, are highly loyal; Gingrich's fall between the two. ADVANTAGE - This poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, suggests that Gingrich holds the advantage to some extent because he lacks the negatives that are pulling back his top two rivals - for Romney, his record on health care and weak ratings on standing up for his beliefs; for Paul, his isolationist views and doubts about his electability. All three candidates have attributes that make them popular - Gingrich his political experience (70 percent call it a major reason to support him), Paul his views on limited government (66 percent call this a strong draw) and Romney his business experience (61 percent say it's a major positive). But 45 percent also see Romney's legacy of mandatory health care in Massachusetts as a major reason to oppose him for the nomination, and 46 percent say the same about Paul's opposition to U.S. military interventions overseas. Gingrich, by contrast, has no negative approaching that magnitude among likely caucus-goers in this survey - neither his views on immigration nor his marital history, seen as major shortcomings by just 15 and 16 percent, respectively. Slightly fewer than four in 10 likely caucus-goers call the economy and jobs the most important issue in their vote; for nearly three in 10 more, it's the federal budget deficit. Gingrich leads in both groups, but Romney's second among economy voters, while Paul's No. 2 among those focused on the deficit. ATTRIBUTES and ISSUES - On personal attributes, Gingrich and Paul alike lead Romney by 2-1 margins as the candidate who's most likely to \\"stand up for what he or she believes\\" - suggesting resonance in the charges that Romney's been inconsistent on the issues. Both similarly lead Romney on empathy, as the candidate who \\"best understands the problems of people like you.\\" Indeed, on these attributes Romney is numerically in fourth place, also behind Bachmann (albeit not by a statistically significant margin). Gingrich, meanwhile, walks away with views that he's got the best experience to be president: 43 percent say so, followed by a vastly lower 16 percent for Romney, 13 percent for Paul. And 29 percent pick Gingrich as having the best chance to defeat Obama. Twenty-four percent give Romney the best shot; Paul lags badly here, with just 8 percent. Gingrich, as noted, leads in trust to handle the economy, selected by 31 percent of likely caucus-goers, with Paul and Romney running essentially evenly behind him, at 21 and 20 percent, respectively. Gingrich also leads in trust to handle immigration, perhaps surprisingly, given his less orthodox views on the issue. He's weaker in trust to handle social issues such as abortion and gay marriage; on this more Iowans prefer Bachmann over the rest of the GOP field. Paul, for his part, leads Gingrich and Romney as the \\"most honest and trustworthy\\" candidate, and, as noted, runs evenly with Romney in trust to handle the economy, behind Gingrich. Paul's support, however, is disproportionately high among younger Iowans, a group whose turnout always is a question mark, especially at the historically lightly attended caucuses. Romney, by contrast, does better with seniors - again as has been the case in national polls - a more reliable turnout group. While turnout is a wild card, Gingrich leads not only among likely caucus-goers, but also among a larger group, potential caucus participants. In this population Gingrich has 28 percent support; Romney, 18 percent; Paul, 16; Perry, 12; Bachmann, 10, Santorum, 4; and Huntsman, 2 percent. Gingrich's rise follows the implosion of Herman Cain's campaign; he withdrew from the race Saturday following claims Nov. 28 by a single mother, Ginger White, that they'd had a 13-year affair. (Cain denied it.) This survey, the first conducted entirely after White's charges were made public, computed vote preference by allocating Cain's supporters to their second choice. When Cain is included as a candidate, he has just 4 percent support from likely caucus-goers, a complete collapse from his 23 percent in a Des Moines Register poll in late October. National polls have tracked the same drop-off for Cain, as well as, earlier, short-lived GOP rallies for Bachmann and Perry. The question for Gingrich is whether he can hold that ground. In one measure of candidate potential, relatively few likely caucus-goers rule out any of the candidates. Just under a quarter, 23 percent, say they definitely would not support Bachmann for the nomination; 18 percent say the same about Romney, 16 percent about Paul. Significant majorities, then, are not flatly rejecting any of these or the other candidates. Notably, among very conservatives, just 23 percent rule out Romney, meaning he may still have a chance in this group were Gingrich to stumble badly in the weeks ahead. Bachmann's problems seem to focus on ability, not likeability. She's rated competitively on qualities such as empathy, honesty, GOP values and standing up for her beliefs, and, as noted, on dealing with social issues. But she falls far short on handling the economy and immigration, having the best experience and in being seen as best able to defeat Obama in November. RELIGION - Religious belief was a strong factor in 2008, when evangelical Christians in Iowa flocked to Mike Huckabee, and enough expressed concerns about Romney's Mormon beliefs to make a difference. It looks like less of an issue now. Some likely caucus-goers, 15 percent, call Romney's religion a major reason to oppose him; 4 percent call it a major reason to support him, while 78 percent say it's not a major factor either way. Gingrich, in any case, leads across religious groups. Ideology, issues and attributes look like much bigger differentiators. OUTREACH and ATTENTION - One surprising result is that Gingrich leads in Iowa despite a shortfall in personal outreach. Three in 10 likely caucus-goers say they have been contacted in person by a representative of the Romney, Paul, Perry and/or Bachmann campaigns. Fewer, 19 percent, say they've been contacted by the Gingrich campaign, similar to Santorum (15 percent) and ahead only of Huntsman (7 percent.) Yet Gingrich leads - raising the question of whether Iowa's reputation as a bastion of retail politics is entirely deserved. Attention to the contest is substantial: Among all potential Republican caucus-goers, 83 percent say they're following the campaign closely; among likely caucus-goers this jumps to 94 percent. Seventy-six percent of likely caucus-goers also describe themselves as satisfied with their choice of candidates (compared with 63 percent of all potential caucus-goers.) And 92 percent of likely caucus goers describe themselves as enthusiastic about the candidate they currently support. Many fewer, though, are \\"very\\" enthusiastic, 36 percent, 9 points fewer than at this time four years ago. The debates have attracted substantial audiences, with 68 percent of likely-caucus goers (and 53 percent of potential participants) saying they've watched. Gingrich's advantage expands among debate watchers, as well as among those who are very closely following the campaign. A WORD ON TURNOUT - Turnout in the Republican Iowa caucuses is usually about a mere 5 percent of the adult population - about 120,000 people in 2008, or roughly the capacity of Michigan Stadium. That makes identifying likely caucus-goers difficult. This survey was conducted via random-sample telephone interviews (landline and cell phone alike) of the full Iowa adult population, winnowing down both to potential caucus-goers, then further identifying likely participants. Potential caucus-goers account for 21 percent of the general population; likely caucus-goers, 8 percent. METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Washington Post survey was conducted by landline and cell phone Nov. 30-Dec. 4, 2011, among a random sample of 858 potential and 356 likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 points for potential caucus-goers and 6 points for likely participants. This survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Newt Gingrich has taken a significant lead in the Iowa Republican caucuses, with 33% support among likely caucus-goers, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll. His rise comes as conservatives seek an alternative to Mitt Romney, who is in a trailing tie with Ron Paul, both at 18%. The poll indicates that Gingrich's lead is partly due to his lack of major negatives compared to his top two rivals. Although support for Romney drops to 11% among very conservative voters, he is not ruled out by the majority, indicating that he may have a chance if Gingrich falters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production.

The 31-year-old won a similar stage that ended atop the 'Beast of Provence' in 2013, catching Quintana before finishing 29 seconds ahead of the Movistar rider. The Briton went on to win his first Tour. Froome said: \\"Ventoux was kind to me, but when I got to the top last time I had to get straight on to oxygen support I was so tired. \\"It's a massive climb, one of the most iconic of this race and to win up there again would be unreal. \\"But it's going to be pretty hard knowing there's a time trial the next day. It will be interesting to see who is going to go that deep for victory up there.\\" That time trial is on Friday when the riders contend with the 37.5km Bourg-Saint-Andeol to La Caverne du Pont-D'Arc route, which has an uphill finish. \\"If Froome is unbeatable at the moment? I feel Nairo is, too,\\" said Quintana's Movistar team-mate Alejandro Valverde. \\"There's still a long way to go in this Tour - you must attack when it's your real time. You never know when it will come.\\" With two-time champion Alberto Contador withdrawing last weekend, it appears Froome only has Quintana to contend with. This is only the Bury-born rider's second Tour, but the expectations of what he can achieve have grown tenfold. Yates said his primary objective was to win stages, but he now finds himself in the mix for the final podium. \\"I'm still here for stages, I came to race for stages,\\" he said. \\"I am doing good on general classification (GC) but it's a background objective. I'm not too bad where I am and we have the rest day tomorrow. I'll rest up and see how the legs come out after.\\" South Africa's Louis Meintjes is 39 seconds behind Yates in the race for the young riders' white jersey, with Frenchman Warren Barguil almost another two minutes further adrift. Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford said Orica-BikeExchange rider Yates should not dismiss his hopes of making an impact in the GC. \\"He should continue racing as long as he can for three weeks, manage himself and see how he gets on,\\" he said. \\"I don't think that if he drops off a little bit that he should sit up and go for stage wins. [He should] keep on persevering with the whole adventure because I think that will stand him very good stead for future years.\\" The 31-year-old Manxman has taken his tally of Tour stage wins to a remarkable 29 - the second highest total ever and only five behind record holder and five-time race winner Eddy Merckx. He leads the points classification but expects to be replaced by Slovak Peter Sagan, who has finished with the green jersey in the last four Tours. \\"Once we hit the mountains, there's no way,\\" he said last Thursday. \\"Peter is on a different level to everyone else and when he decides to do something he just does it. It's nice to wear green but there's nobody targeting it in Paris other than Peter.\\" After Sunday's first major stage in the mountains, Cavendish said: \\"It was hot, I hate it in the Pyrenees. It's just too hot for me, I'm from the Isle of Man.\\" The 2011 green jersey winner did hold a 29-point lead over Sagan, but that is now down to seven.","completion":"Brits Chris Froome, Mark Cavendish, and Adam Yates are dominating the Tour de France, with Froome wearing the yellow leader's jersey, Yates leading the young riders category and Cavendish leading in points."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: a). no; b). yes;","completion":"The two questions are not asking precisely the same thing, so the answer would be a). No. First, let me address each question individually. 1. How do winners think? Winners possess a unique mindset that contributes to their success. Here are some essential aspects of how winners think: a. Positive thinking: Winners maintain an optimistic perspective and focus on their goals rather than dwelling on obstacles or failures. They believe in their abilities and are confident that they can achieve their objectives. b. Growth mindset: Winners embrace challenges and view them as opportunities to learn and grow. They are not held back by a fear of failure, and instead, they see setbacks as a chance to improve and develop new strategies. c. Goal-orientation: Winners have clear, well-defined objectives and devise a plan to achieve them. They set realistic, measurable, and time-based goals and are committed to accomplishing them. d. Perseverance: Winners understand that success is rarely immediate, and they are willing to invest their time and effort to reach their goals. They do not give up easily and are relentless in their pursuit of achievement. e. Emotional intelligence: Winners possess a high degree of self-awareness, and they can regulate their emotions effectively. They are also empathetic, enabling them to collaborate with others and form strong relationships. f. Taking responsibility: Winners take ownership of their actions and the outcomes they produce, both positive and negative. Acknowledging their mistakes allows them to learn from them and avoid repeating them in the future. 2. How do I become a winner? While the thought processes of winners are a significant factor in their success, transforming yourself into a winner involves taking concrete actions. Here's what you can do to become a winner: a. Develop a positive mindset: Cultivate optimism and maintain a can-do attitude. This will help you overcome challenges and stay focused on achieving your goals. b. Set clear goals: Define your objectives and break them down into smaller, manageable steps. This will keep you motivated and provide a roadmap to success. c. Embrace a growth mindset: Be open to learning from your experiences and developing new strategies when encountering roadblocks. Seek opportunities for personal development and skill enhancement. d. Cultivate discipline and good habits: Develop productive routines and practice time-management to make the most of your resources. Strive for consistency in your actions to build momentum toward your goals. e. Improve your emotional intelligence: Enhance self-awareness and emotional regulation to maintain focus and resilience. Foster empathy and strengthen relationships with others, as this can provide valuable support in your journey. f. Take responsibility for your actions: Embrace accountability for both your achievements and setbacks. Learn from your mistakes and use them as fuel for personal growth.

Clarity: The review is brief and gets straight to the point by mentioning the speed and ease of use. However, it has a typo with \\"East\\" (which should probably be \\"easy\\"). The message could be clearer if the reviewer provided some context about the product or service being reviewed. It's not immediately apparent if the reviewer is comparing this to another service or providing standalone feedback. Moreover, the mention of Windows, Mac, and Linux might be confusing to some readers; a better phrase would be \\"across different operating systems like Windows, Mac, or Linux.\\" 2. Balance: The review includes a positive aspect (speed and ease of use) and a potential concern (anonymity). It shows that the reviewer has thought about and investigated different features, displaying a level of impartiality that's essential in an informative review. But again, the context is missing. 3. Helpfulness: The review touches upon essential features that might interest prospective users, primarily speed and degree of anonymity. However, the reviewer's uncertainty about anonymity might leave readers with more questions than answers. Other factors that might be useful to mention in a review, such as stability, user interface, or customer support, are not discussed. 4. Objectivity: The reader can infer that the reviewer is comparing the product or service to Tor, a privacy-oriented web browser, and it's important for reviews to have a benchmark or comparison to evaluate the experience. Yet, the reviewer doesn't provide enough detail to fully understand the comparison or the particular aspects in which they find similarities or differences. 5. Conciseness: Although the review is concise, it could benefit from including more information about the product or service, specific features, or even the reviewer's personal experience. In conclusion, while the review has its merits in terms of offering a quick insight into the product or service's performance in comparison to Tor and across multiple operating systems, it falls short in providing adequate context and detail, ultimately reducing its usefulness to potential users.

Would \\"Related terms include bias (non- random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable ) and error (random variability).\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"When discussing the concept of editing precision, it is essential to first understand the terms \\"precision\\" and \\"editing\\" in the context of research methodology, data analysis, and statistics. Precision refers to the degree to which measurements or estimates are reproducible and consistent when the same data is collected or analyzed multiple times under the same conditions. Editing, in this context, refers to the process of correcting, refining, or adjusting data to ensure its accuracy, quality, and consistency. Regarding the question, \\"Would 'Related terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability)' be a reasonable answer?\\", we need to reconsider how this answer connects to the topic of editing precision. Accuracy and precision are the two key parameters in determining the quality of measurements and estimates. While accuracy refers to how close the measurements or estimates are to the true or reference value, precision assesses the consistency and reproducibility of these measurements or estimates. Bias and error are indeed related terms that influence the quality and interpretation of data. However, they do not directly refer to editing precision but are essential considerations in ensuring accurate and precise measurements. Bias refers to the presence of non-random or systematic errors in data and results that cause deviations from the true or reference value. These deviations can stem from various factors unrelated to the independent variable, such as errors in sampling, measurement, or data collection methods. Reducing bias is crucial for improving accuracy and credibility in research findings. Error, on the other hand, describes the random variability or fluctuations in measurements or estimates due to factors such as instrumental or observational imprecisions, external factors, or human errors. Error can be categorized into two types: systematic error (which contributes to bias) and random error. Random errors can be reduced by increasing the sample size or adopting better measurement techniques, thereby enhancing the precision of the study. Editing precision, while not directly related to bias and error, is an essential aspect of the data refinement process that can impact the accuracy and precision of research findings. Editing helps identify and rectify issues such as data anomalies, inconsistencies, or discrepancies that might arise from biases and errors present in the data. In doing so, editing precision contributes to minimizing the influence of bias and error on research findings, leading to more accurate and precise results. In conclusion, while the answer provided touches upon some important concepts, it does not directly address the concept of editing precision. A more appropriate response would be: \\"Editing precision refers to the process of ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reproducibility of data by carefully refining and correcting data points to minimize the influence of bias and error on research findings.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'date of birth' with '1960'. Answer:","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'date of birth' with '1960' is Houston Baptist University. According to the provided information, it is stated that Houston Baptist University (HBU) is a private Baptist university which was founded in 1960. The date '1960' thus, stands as the year of establishment or 'birth' for this particular institution. Houston Baptist University is located in the Southwest Management District, formerly Greater Sharpstown, in Houston, Texas, which is near the Southwest Freeway. The Cultural Arts Center at the university houses three museums: the Dunham Bible Museum, the Museum of American Architecture and Decorative Arts, and the Museum of Southern History. Despite its relatively recent establishment in comparison to some other institutions, HBU plays a significant role in the educational landscape, contributing to the academic and cultural life of its locale. It’s important to note that in this context, the term 'birth' is used metaphorically to represent the inception or commencement of an entity, which in this case is an educational institution. Although 'birth' is typically associated with living beings, it is not uncommon to use the term in reference to the creation or start of organizations, groups, or other entities. Such usage helps us to symbolize and understand them in terms of lifecycles, relating their establishment, growth, changes, and potential closure or end, to the familiar processes of life that we all undergo."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It involved adding bacon grease to whiskey which sat at room temp for a certain period of time and was then chilled . The next day , the grease has hardened so it was removed . What is the narrator researching on TV ?","completion":"The narrator on TV is researching a culinary technique called \\"fat washing.\\" Fat washing is the process of infusing a liquid, typically alcohol or liquor, with the flavor of a specific type of fat, such as bacon grease. This method creates a unique fusion of flavors in the spirit while also adding a subtle, rich, and umami taste. In the Food Network program mentioned, they are showcasing a bar serving bacon-flavored whiskey, which has undergone the fat washing process. They've used bacon grease to add a savory, smoky element to the whiskey, thus enhancing the overall taste experience. The process generally involves the following steps: 1. Preparation of the fat: The first step in creating a fat-washed spirit is to obtain the desired fat. In this case, bacon grease is used. The bacon is cooked until the fat is rendered out, and then the grease is collected while still in its liquid form. 2. Infusion process: Next, the liquid fat is combined with a measured amount of the chosen spirit, such as whiskey. The mixture is then stirred together and left to sit at room temperature for a specified period (ranging from hours to days) to ensure proper infusion. 3. Cooling and separation: After the infusion process is complete, the liquid is transferred to a chilled environment, such as a refrigerator or freezer. This step allows the fat to solidify and rise to the top of the mixture, making it easy to remove. 4. Filtering: Once the fat has solidified, it is carefully removed from the surface of the liquid, and the remaining liquid is filtered to ensure that all fat particles are removed. The resulting infused spirit is now ready to be enjoyed as a stand-alone beverage or incorporated into creative cocktails. 5. Tasting and enjoying: The final step in the process is, of course, tasting and savoring the unique, flavorful result of the fat washing process. The whiskey in this case would have a distinct bacon flavor profile, with hints of smokiness and umami notes, making it a unique and delicious libation to be appreciated by whiskey enthusiasts and culinary adventurers alike. The narrator's research into fat washing opens viewers' eyes to a myriad of possibilities when it comes to combining and experimenting with flavors.

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What do power plants burn to generate electricity? A: A:","completion":"Power plants burn a variety of fuels to generate electricity, depending on the type of power plant and the specific requirements of the location. There are several fuel sources that are commonly used in power plants, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here, we will discuss various fuels used in power plants to produce electricity. 1. Fossil Fuels: Fossil fuels are the most widely-used fuel sources in power plants across the globe. They include coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals, which have been subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. a. Coal: Coal is the most abundant and widely-used fossil fuel, predominantly in thermal power plants. Power plants burn coal to produce steam, which drives turbines that generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants are relatively cheaper to build and operate, but they emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing significantly to air pollution and climate change. b. Oil: Oil-fired power plants are less common than coal-fired plants, but they still play a role in electricity generation. They burn petroleum products like diesel or heavy fuel oil to generate steam, which powers turbines to produce electricity. Oil-fired power plants are often used as backup power sources or in areas where oil is abundant and easily accessible. However, they also contribute to air pollution and are usually more expensive to operate than coal-fired power plants. c. Natural Gas: Natural gas is an increasingly popular choice for electricity generation due to its abundance and lower environmental impact compared to coal and oil. Natural gas-fired power plants burn the fuel in combustion turbines or combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) to generate electricity. These power plants emit about half as much carbon dioxide as coal-fired plants and produce fewer air pollutants. However, the extraction and transportation of natural gas can have significant environmental impacts, including the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. 2. Nuclear Fuels: Nuclear power plants use nuclear fuels, primarily uranium, to generate electricity. In a nuclear power plant, the heat generated from nuclear reactions (fission) is used to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators. Nuclear power plants have the advantage of producing a large amount of electricity without emitting greenhouse gases or air pollutants. However, they present considerable challenges related to the storage and disposal of radioactive waste, as well as potential safety risks. 3. Biomass: Biomass power plants utilize organic materials, such as wood, crop residues, or animal manure, to generate electricity. The process involves burning these materials to produce steam, which powers turbines to generate electricity. Biomass power plants are considered a renewable energy source, but they still emit carbon dioxide and other pollutants, albeit at lower levels than fossil fuel power plants. The sustainability of biomass power plants depends on the sources and management of the biomass used. 4. Renewables: Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, have become increasingly popular for electricity generation. These power plants do not burn any fuel, but instead, they convert sunlight, wind, or water flow into electricity. While these renewable sources have lower environmental impacts and can help reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, their availability is subject to fluctuating weather conditions, which can impact the stability of the power supply. In conclusion, power plants burn a variety of fuels to generate electricity, including fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, nuclear fuels like uranium, and biomass materials. The choice of fuel depends on factors such as availability, cost, efficiency, and environmental impact. With growing concerns over climate change and air pollution, there has been a shift toward renewable energy sources that have lesser environmental impacts and can contribute to sustainable electricity generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To explain further, this sentence refers to the schedule for a particular construction project - the new terminal. The terminal could be referring to various types of facilities including an airport terminal, a bus terminal, a railway station terminal, or a shipping terminal among others. The term \\"commissioning\\" means the process of assuring that all systems and components of a building or industrial plant are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client. In this context, it's about signing off the terminal as ready for use. The phrase \\"second half of 2010\\" means that the terminal should be fully functional and ready for use sometime between July and December of the year 2010. This timeframe lets the parties involved in the project know when the construction should be completed and ready to serve its intended purpose. However, keep in mind that such deadlines are on the basis of proposed plans and could be subject to changes, depending upon a variety of factors including but not limited to the pace of work, any unanticipated complications or delays in the project, changes in the project scope, unforeseen financial issues, or a change in the requirements from the owner or final client. In project management this deadline is usually set by project managers, and in the construction industry it could involve numerous stakeholders like architects, engineers, builders, suppliers, and regulatory bodies each having key roles to play in ensuring the terminal is ready and operational by the second half of 2010. This also entails that proper planning, checks and balances, and a systemized approach to monitoring the progress of the project is utilized to prevent any deviations from the set deadline.

Write an article based on this summary: For more than 80 years a small brass plaque, no larger than a dinner plate, sat embedded in the tarmac in front of Bangkok's Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, worn down after being driven over countless of times by traffic.","completion":"Title: The Enigmatic Brass Plaque: A Piece of History Shrouded in Mystery Introduction For over eight decades, an unassuming brass plaque embedded in the tarmac in front of Bangkok's Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall stood as a testament to a crucial turning point in Thai history. Barely noticeable and no larger than a dinner plate, this emblematic artifact carried an untold story of strife and transformation that lay hidden beneath the worn-down surface, eroded by the relentless passage of time and the countless tires that drove over it. In this article, we delve into the fascinating tale behind this mysterious relic and examine its significance to the rich history of Thailand. The Brass Plaque and Its Origins The small brass plaque, nestled in the busy streets of the bustling Thai capital, paid homage to the transformation of the country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one. Installed in 1936, the plaque commemorated the Siamese Revolution of 1932, which saw the ruling Rama VII grant the first constitution of the Kingdom of Siam (now known as Thailand), paving the way for a parliamentary system. This significant change, primarily led by the People's Party, a group of military officers and civil servants, marked a crucial milestone in the Thai political landscape. The brass plaque bore the emblem of the new regime, characterized by the flag incorporating an image of the Garuda - a mythical half-human and half-bird creature - and the royal symbol of Thailand. This flag was a constant reminder of the nation's hard-fought journey towards democracy and autonomy. The Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall: Where Two Worlds Collide The unassuming bronze plaque was strategically placed in front of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, a historic landmark in the Dusit Palace complex. Built in 1915 during the reign of King Rama V, the magnificent throne hall embodies the quintessential blend of rich Siamese architectural styles and Italian neo-classical designs. This grand structure served as the seat of Thailand's first parliament, the same venue where the constitution was promulgated, signaling a shift from autocratic rule to a modernized government. By installing the brass plaque at this symbolic location, an eternal bond was cemented between the nation's royal heritage and its democratic aspirations. The Fate of the Brass Plaque and Thailand's Political Evolution Despite the powerful symbolism carried by the iconic brass plaque, the physical artifact recently vanished without a trace, further shrouding its existence in enigma and intrigue. It has been replaced by a new plaque that bears an inscription, which, loosely translated, reads \\"May Siam be blessed with prosperity and security.\\" Speculations abound on the reasons behind the plaque's disappearance and the nature of its replacement, with some believing it might signal a shift in political power. Nevertheless, the resilience of the Thai people in their pursuit of democratic ideals remains strong, with the memory of the original brass plaque continuing to live on in the country's collective consciousness. Conclusion The curious case of the small brass plaque serves as a poignant reminder of the power of seemingly mundane objects to tell a significant story. Embedded in the tarmac, and worn down by the passage of time and countless traffic, the plaque tells a tale of a nation's historic struggle, its triumph over absolutism, and its relentless quest for democracy. The disappearance of this humble artifact has only strengthened its enigmatic allure and further solidified its status as a powerful symbol of Thailand's complex political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.

Outline the penguin. Color in your penguin. Finished.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: How to Draw a Penguin in Simple Steps for Kids Hey little friends! Today, we're going to learn how to draw a cute penguin using easy shapes. Drawing can be so much fun, and it's a great way to use our imagination. So, grab your crayons, colored pencils, or markers, and let's start! Step 1: Draw an egg First, we need to draw the penguin's body. An egg shape is perfect because it's round and a little bit pointy at the top. This will be the main part of the penguin's body. Remember, it doesn't have to be perfect - just a simple shape is good enough! Step 2: Draw two circles for the eyes Now we need to give our penguin some eyes so it can see! Draw two circles on the upper part of the egg shape. Remember to leave some space in between for the beak later on. These circles will be our penguin's cute little eyes. Step 3: Draw ovals for the wings Next, it's time to give our penguin some wings! Draw two oval shapes on each side of the egg shape, near the middle. These ovals will become the wings that help our penguin swim through the water. They don't need to be too big, as they should be just the right size for our penguin buddy. Step 4: Draw small half ovals for the feet Our penguin needs feet, too! Draw two small half oval shapes at the bottom of the egg shape. These little half ovals should point outwards since penguins have webbed feet that help them waddle and swim. Now, our penguin is standing. Step 5: Outline the penguin With all the basic shapes for our penguin drawn, it's time to outline it, so it looks more like a real penguin. Start at the top of the egg shape and draw a small triangle for the beak in between the eyes. Then, trace around the wings and feet, adding some gentle curves to make them look more natural. Step 6: Color in your penguin Now comes the most fun part - coloring in our penguin! Penguins are usually black and white, with maybe a touch of orange on their beak and feet. Use a black color for the body (except where the eyes are) and color the eyes white or light blue. Don't forget to add some white on the penguin's belly, too. Finally, use a little bit of orange for the beak and feet. Step 7: Finished! Congratulations, you've drawn a cute and simple penguin! How does your penguin look? You can give your penguin a name, a snowy background, or even draw a whole family of penguins. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep drawing and having fun!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What had \\"killed and severely injured lake bathers recently?\\" Answer the above question based on the context below: Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These people say the real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for Jaws—may be the lesser known bull shark.\\"Biologists George A. Llano and Richard Ellis suggest that a bull shark could have been responsible for the fatal Jersey Shore attacks. Bull sharks swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have attacked people around the world. In his book Sharks: Attacks on Man (1975), Llano writes, One of the most surprising aspects of the Matawan Creek attacks was the distance from the open sea. Elsewhere in the book are accounts of well-documented shark-human interactions at Ahwaz, Iran, which is 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the sea.

Is \\"All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Who was the only Arab leader not to attend Nasser's funeral?\\"","completion":"While the sentence \\"All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.\\" technically answers the question \\"Who was the only Arab leader not to attend Nasser's funeral?\\" by identifying Saudi King Faisal as the only leader who did not attend, a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question can be provided. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the second President of Egypt and a key figure in the Pan-Arab movement, died suddenly of a heart attack on the 28th of September, 1970. His passing marked the end of an era and brought world leaders together to mourn his loss. Nasser's funeral, held on October 1, 1970, saw the attendance of a large number of international dignitaries, including numerous heads of state and government. Although most Arab leaders attended the funeral, Saudi King Faisal chose not to participate. King Faisal's decision not to attend can be traced back to the tumultuous period of Arab politics, particularly the divide between different factions vying for leadership and influence in the region. The cultural and political clashes between Egypt and Saudi Arabia during Nasser's presidency were well known, and this animosity hinted at the reason for King Faisal's absence. While Nasser's Egypt was a key driver of Pan-Arabism, which sought to unite the Arab world under a common cultural and political identity, Saudi Arabia was advocating for a more conservative and religiously-inspired form of governance. The two nations' differing geopolitical alignments further contributed to their discord: Egypt was a key ally for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, while Saudi Arabia was aligned with the United States. Furthermore, both nations competed for regional leadership, with Nasser positioning Egypt at the forefront of Arab unity, a role to which Saudi Arabia also aspired. The relationship between these two nations was fraught with disputes and, in some cases, outright hostility. For example, Egypt and Saudi Arabia were on opposing sides during the Yemen Civil War in the 1960s, with Egypt supporting the republicans and Saudi Arabia backing the royalists. These factors culminated in a tense relationship between the leaders of both countries. In conclusion, while the initial answer of \\"All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal.\\" may quickly relay the fact that King Faisal was the only Arab leader not to attend Nasser's funeral, it lacks the depth and historical context needed for a comprehensive understanding. By examining the political landscape of the time, the strained relationship between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and the differing ideologies at play, a more complete account of the absence of King Faisal at Nasser's funeral can be provided."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The Stanley Cup playoffs, as you've mentioned, is an elimination tournament in the National Hockey League (NHL), and it consists of four rounds of best-of-seven series. The playoffs include eight teams from each of the two conferences (Eastern and Western), and these 16 teams qualify based on their regular-season points totals. Here is a brief overview of the entire Stanley Cup playoffs structure: 1. **First Round (Conference Quarterfinals):** In the first round, the top eight teams from each conference are paired according to their seedings in the regular season, with the highest seeded team facing the lowest seeded team and so on. These eight series are best-of-seven, with the winners advancing to the second round. 2. **Second Round (Conference Semifinals):** In this round, the remaining four teams in each conference face off in another set of best-of-seven series, with the playoff bracket structure determining the matchups. The winners advance to the Conference Finals. 3. **Conference Finals:** The two remaining teams in each conference compete in best-of-seven series, with the winners being crowned the Conference Champions. The Eastern and Western Conference Champions advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. 4. **Stanley Cup Finals:** The final round of the playoffs, commonly known as the Stanley Cup Finals, is a best-of-seven series between the Eastern and Western Conference Champions. The team that wins four games out of the seven in this final round is awarded the prestigious Stanley Cup, the championship trophy of the NHL. Throughout all four rounds, the team with the better regular-season record (also called the higher-seeded team) is given home-ice advantage, meaning they get to host four out of the possible seven games. The first two games take place in the higher-seeded team's arena, followed by two games in the lower-seeded team's arena. If required, the series will alternate venues for the remaining games: Game 5 in the higher-seeded team's arena, Game 6 in the lower-seeded team's arena, and Game 7 back in the higher-seeded team's arena. In summary, the first round of the NHL playoffs is indeed a best-of-seven series, with all subsequent rounds following the same format until a team wins the Stanley Cup. The structure involves several highly competitive matchups and intense battles on the ice, making the playoffs an exciting and eagerly anticipated event for hockey fans across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The band originally called themselves \\"Magneto U.S.A.\\" but changed their name after signing with Hollywood Records. In 1998, their album All the Pain Money Can Buy reached platinum sales within six months of its release, and stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for a year. In addition, the group has been nominated for two Grammy Awards - Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for \\"The Way\\", and Best Long Form Music Video for their promotional video \\"The Way\\". The group headed back into the studio to record their third album, The Harsh Light of Day. Produced by Julian Raymond and Fastball, the album was released in September 2000. The release included \\"You're an Ocean\\", which featured the piano stylings of Billy Preston (who previously collaborated with The Beatles). Singer-guitarist Brian Setzer also contributed to the album with Latin guitar on \\"Love Is Expensive and Free.\\" \\"Instead of tailoring the music for short attention spans, we tried to make an album that holds up well to extensive listening... kind of cinematic, where you notice new themes entering the frame each time you see the film,\\" Zuniga said in the band's record company bio. Although The Harsh Light of Day sold less than 85,000 copies (compared to All The Pain Money Can Buy's 1,000,000+), the trio didn't lose steam and chalked it up to lacking a musical category to fit into. \\"You can't write down what we do in a sentence,\\" Zuniga told Mac Randall at Launch.com. \\"Marketing us is a problem.

Rebecca's toddler was a better eater than Kayla's, as a result of","completion":"Rebecca's consistent approach to introducing a diverse range of healthy foods from an early age. While Kayla struggled with her fussy eater, Rebecca took each meal as an opportunity to educate her child about the importance of varied and nutritious meals. This led to a substantial difference in their toddlers' eating habits, making it evident which of them had established a healthy relationship with food. Rebecca believed that it was crucial to start early in her child's life and consistently expose her toddler to various flavors and textures. She understood that young children were naturally apprehensive in trying new things, especially when it came to food. Instead of pleading and bargaining with her little one, she chose to create positive associations with mealtime. This, in turn, contributed to her toddler becoming an adventurous eater who enjoyed exploring different food options. One of the key strategies that Rebecca employed was offering an assortment of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. She wanted her child to discover the world of flavors without the interference of processed and sugar-laden foods. By consistently rotating foods and presenting them creatively, she gave her toddler every opportunity to taste and appreciate healthy options. This led to an increased willingness in the child to experiment with new food combinations. From the very beginning, Rebecca incorporated mealtime rituals such as eating together as a family and engaging in conversations. This method allowed her toddler to feel more secure and relaxed during mealtimes, resulting in a guilt-free and enjoyable experience. She emphasized the importance of mindful eating over pressurizing her child to finish their plate. Furthermore, Rebecca invested extra effort in cooking, focusing on building flavors and seasoning her meals. Healthy foods can often seem bland or boring, especially to a developing palate, but Rebecca's culinary skills ensured that her dishes were appetizing and appealing. Her toddler quickly learned that nutritious food could be delicious and satisfying, eliminating the notion that healthy eating was synonymous with sacrificing taste. Contrarily, Kayla encountered various challenges with her fussy eater. She didn't have the same mindset as Rebecca and opted for convenience over crafting flavorful and varied homemade meals. Though Kayla tried to offer healthy options, she often resorted to giving her child processed foods that catered to their limited palate, fearing that her toddler would go hungry. Unfortunately, this decision only reinforced her child's choosy tendencies and made it harder for them to accept new foods when they were introduced. Kayla's child ended up relying on a limited selection of meals, making it difficult for them to obtain a well-rounded and balanced diet. This caused Kayla considerable stress, as she grappled with the consequences of not implementing a positive eating environment from the beginning. In conclusion, the substantial difference in eating habits between Rebecca's and Kayla's toddlers can be attributed to Rebecca's early and consistent efforts in cultivating a healthy relationship with food. By exposing her child to a diverse palette, combining mealtime rituals with adventurous experimentation, and focusing on skillful cooking, Rebecca demonstrated the significance of a healthy and nutritious diet. On the other hand, Kayla's choice of convenience inadvertently contributed to the development of her child's picky tendencies, resulting in a more difficult and limited eating experience. This comparison highlights the importance of a dedicated and mindful approach to feeding toddlers in promoting healthier eating habits in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded. They cuddle, and their bodies form a heart-shaped silhouette on the horizon.","completion":"In the given article, Peter the penguin saves Polly from a shark.

Next question: which country's flag is called union jack?","completion":"The \\"Union Jack\\" is the national flag of the United Kingdom, which is a country located off the northwestern coast of mainland Europe. The United Kingdom is a union of four countries – England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Union Jack plays an important role in the history, culture, and identity of the UK and holds symbolic weight as its people's most easily identifiable emblem. The Union Jack's design and its name have evolved as the United Kingdom's composition and territorial expanse have changed. It derives its name from the concept of a \\"jack\\" – a small flag flown from a ship's jackstaff, primarily used to identify the nationality of the vessel to which it belongs. However, the term \\"Union Jack\\" is sometimes used more generically to refer to the flag, even when it is not flown aboard a ship. The Union Jack features a striking and unique design that combines elements of three different flags, each representing the three older countries that initially formed the United Kingdom, thus symbolizing their union: 1. The Flag of England: The flag of England is a red cross of St. George on a white background. St. George's Cross has been a symbol of English national identity since the Middle Ages and was used by England's navy during the Crusades. 2. The Flag of Scotland: Scotland's national flag is a diagonal white cross of St. Andrew on a blue background. Also known as the \\"Saltire,\\" it is believed to be the oldest continuously used flag in Europe, even predating its incorporation into the Union Jack design. 3. The Flag of Ireland: The Union Jack incorporates a red saltire, which represents St. Patrick's Cross, symbolizing the island of Ireland. While this version of St. Patrick's Cross is now predominantly associated with the whole island, it was initially intended to represent the kingdom of Ireland when added to the Union Jack design in 1801 following the Acts of Union between Great Britain and Ireland. When the United Kingdom was formed and the Union Jack adopted as its flag, the flag represented the union of England, Scotland, and Ireland, while Wales was considered a principality under the realm of England. In modern times, the Union Jack has been widely recognized and flown both within the United Kingdom and around the world. It has become a symbol of the British Empire and today represents the British Commonwealth in the many countries that once formed part of the empire. Additionally, the Union Jack plays an important role in diplomatic ceremonies, sporting events, and other international gatherings, serving to showcase the United Kingdom's presence, history, and influence on a global stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The overseas expansion under the crown of Castile was initiated under the royal authority and first accomplished by the Spanish conquistadores. The Americas were incorporated into the Spanish Empire, with the exception of Brazil and Canada, and the crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions. Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America (including present day Mexico, Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States). During the Napoleonic Peninsular War in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called juntas were established to rule in the name of Ferdinand VII of Spain. The Libertadores (Spanish and Portuguese for \\"Liberators\\") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly criollos (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), bourgeois and influenced by liberalism and in some cases with military training in the mother country. In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the Viceroyalty of New Granada. The first two were in present-day Bolivia at Sucre (May 25), and La Paz (July 16); and the third in present-day Ecuador at Quito (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the Mexican War of Independence following for over a decade. In 1821 Treaty of Cordoba established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The Plan of Iguala was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico. These began a movement for colonial independence that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the French and the American Revolution influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The British Empire offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas. In 1898, the United States achieved victory in the Spanish-American War with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era. Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States. The United States took occupation of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States, now officially continues as a self-governing unincorporated territory.

In the July 2 piece, writer Abdul Ali interviews Natalie Hopkinson, author of the new book “Go-Go Live: The Musical Life and Death of a Chocolate City.” The article outlines how local authorities have cracked down on the go-go scene over the years, but the opening paragraphs jump out. After the death of go-go progenitor Chuck Brown in May, Ali says he witnessed “a clash” between mourners and authorities outside of the Howard Theatre, describing it as “a rowdy showdown between go-go fans and the police.” It’s unclear whether Ali is referring to the impromptu gathering outside of the Howard on the evening of May 16 or the official wake on May 29, but both events were reported to be largely, if not entirely, peaceful. Ali declined to comment on the story, but said that the Atlantic will be posting a revised version shortly.

We regret the errors.”] Read the story’s original two paragraphs below: How Washington, D.C.

Chuck Brown, the guitarist who became synonymous with D.C.'s go-go music scene, had died at age 75. But while the assembled waited for the wake to begin, a man in a police jersey showed up and told the crowd to disband. The event quickly became political—a turf battle between the establishment and the fading, working-class, black population that calls go-go music its own. The crowd didn't budge. Instead, it got more vocal and agitated. \\"Wind me up, Chuck,\\" the masses roared (a common refrain shouted at Mr. Brown's concerts.) The clash may have looked to an onlooker like a rowdy showdown between go-go fans and the police, but it was also a lament from a community who over the past decade has witnessed repeated, flagrant reminders that their music isn't welcome in the new vision of D.C.” (Read the full story here.)

Question: suppose humans are eliminated happens, how will it affect more rocks are scoured. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If humans are eliminated, the production of acid rain would likely decrease significantly. This is because human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are the primary sources of chemicals (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide) that cause acid rain. With the reduced emission of these chemicals, their concentration in the atmosphere would decrease, which would lead to less acid rain. As a result of this decrease in acid rain, the scouring of rocks would be lessened, and the second effect mentioned (destruction of vegetation) would also be influenced by this reduction. With less acid rain, vegetation would be exposed to fewer harmful chemicals, which would lead to a lesser extent of damage. This would have a positive effect on vegetation, allowing it to regenerate and potentially restoring the surrounding environment to a more natural state. In conclusion, if human activities were to cease, and as a consequence, the production of acid rain decreases, it would have a lessened effect on both the scouring of rocks and the destruction of vegetation.

The nickname originates from the term \\"sooners,\\" which refers to the settlers who participated in the Land Rush of 1889. It is important to understand the historical context and the reasons behind this unique nickname for Oklahoma. In 1889, vast unassigned parcels of land in what is now known as Oklahoma were opened for settlement through an event called the Land Run. The Land Run of 1889, also known as the Oklahoma Land Rush, took place on April 22 of that year. The 1889 event was the first of several land runs in Oklahoma Territory, and it allowed settlers to claim public land on a first-come, first-served basis. At this time, Oklahoma was not an official state and was considered part of the region known as the Unassigned Lands. It was a rural area that was formerly designated for use by Native American tribes, but when tribal reservations were reduced, these lands became available for non-native settlement. On the day of the event, the U.S. government announced that at noon, settlers could enter the Unassigned Lands and claim a parcel by marking the corners of the plot with stakes or by initiating occupancy in the dwelling if a structure was present. As the government wanted to ensure a fair and orderly process, they imposed strict rules against entering the land before the official start time. However, some individuals chose to ignore these regulations. They crossed into the territory before the official start time, hoping to claim the best available land. These individuals were dubbed \\"sooners,\\" earning them a somewhat negative reputation as cheaters and opportunists, as they disregarded the rules and gained an unfair advantage in the rush for land. Despite this initial negative portrayal, the term \\"sooner\\" was later adopted as a nickname for Oklahoma residents with a sense of pride. Today, it is a symbol of their resilience, resourcefulness, and willingness to seize opportunities to improve their lives. The term has transcended its original meaning, and the \\"Sooner State\\" now pays homage to the state's rich history, including the role it played as a key event in the westward expansion of the United States. In addition to being known as the Sooner State, Oklahoma has other symbols that represent the diverse culture and geography of the state. The state's official bird is the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, and the state tree is the Redbud. Oklahoma's flag features an Osage Nation buffalo-skin shield crossed with two symbols of peace, an olive branch, and a peace pipe, along with an eagle feather and the state’s name on a blue field. Overall, Oklahoma's Sooner State nickname showcases the tenacity and determination of its residents, highlighting the region's significance in American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nur Alam Shah was not put on trial, although he was exposed as an active Indian nationalist with links to Ghadar. Instead, he was detained and deported, as the British did not want to stir up trouble among their Muslim subjects.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: The muscular system consists of all the muscles in the body. This is the body system that allows us to move. You also depend on many muscles to keep you alive. Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood around your body. Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are long, thin cells that can do something that other cells cannot dothey are able to get shorter. Shortening of muscle fibers is called contraction. Muscle fibers can contract because they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long filaments (or fibers). When muscles contract, these protein filaments slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the cell. When your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position. Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction. You can control some muscle movements. However, certain muscle movements happen without you thinking about them. Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles. Muscles that are not under your conscious control are called involuntary muscles. Muscle tissue is one of the four types of tissue found in animals. There are three different types of muscle in the body ( Figure 1.1): 1. Skeletal muscle is made up of voluntary muscles, usually attached to the skeleton. Skeletal muscles move the body. They can also contract involuntarily by reflexes. For example, you can choose to move your arm, but your arm would move automatically if you were to burn your finger on a stove top. This voluntary contraction begins with a thought process. A signal from your brain tells your muscles to contract or relax. Quickly contract and relax the muscles in your fingers a few times. Think about how quickly these signals must travel throughout your body to make this happen. 2. Smooth muscle is composed of involuntary muscles found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. These muscles push materials like food or blood through organs. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle can never be under your control. 3. Cardiac muscle is also an involuntary muscle, found only in the heart. The cardiac muscle fibers all contract together, generating enough force to push blood throughout the body. What would happen if this muscle was under conscious or voluntary control? There are three types of muscles in the body: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. Question: what muscle pushes food through your intestines? Output:","completion":"smooth muscle"},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Please answer the following question: Thick fur can be used for keeping warm, and pelts are the skins of animals with the fur attached. Given these facts, what can be used by an animal to keep warm among the following options: - a thick pelt - heat energy - evaporation - energy - kinetic energy - electricity - four limbs - organic molecules Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the most effective way for an animal to keep warm is by using a thick pelt. A thick pelt acts as a natural insulator that can trap air close to the animal's body, which in turn helps to keep them warm. The trapped air functions as a barrier between the animal's body and the cold external environment, preventing heat loss. Additionally, the fur found on a pelt can also effectively reduce the effect of wind on the animal's skin, creating an extra layer of protection against cold temperatures. Heat energy and energy also contribute to an animal's ability to keep warm, as these two concepts are related to fur's ability to retain warmth. When the animal's body generates heat due to metabolic processes, that heat is retained within the fur. This retention of heat helps maintain the animal's internal body temperature. However, considering the options listed, a thick pelt is the most directly connected element for maintaining warmth in animals. Kinetic energy is a type of energy that is associated with an object in motion. While an animal's movement can generate heat through the use of kinetic energy, this energy is not as effective in retaining warmth as a thick pelt. Movement can provide a temporary source of heat generation, but does not provide the same level of insulation and protection against heat loss as a thick fur covering. Electricity is not generally used by animals to keep warm, as it is a form of energy often harnessed by humans in technology, such as electric heaters. Animals typically do not use electricity as a heat source in their biological processes. Evaporation generally leads to cooling, not warming. In animals, evaporative cooling can occur through processes such as sweating or panting, which help to dissipate heat from their bodies. In this case, evaporation is not used to keep warm but rather to cool down when the animal becomes overheated. Four limbs are not directly related to an animal's ability to keep warm, as they serve primarily as a means of mobility and support for the structure of the animal's body. However, in some cases, animals can use their limbs to curl up in order to conserve heat and reduce their exposure to the external environment. Organic molecules generally refer to carbon-based molecules that make up living organisms, including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. While these molecules are vital to the overall function and survival of animals, they do not specifically serve to keep an animal warm in the way that a thick pelt does. In summary, among the given options, a thick pelt is the most effective method for an animal to keep warm. It provides insulation and protection against heat loss, which helps the animal maintain its internal body temperature in cold environments."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you will be shown a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending.

The disorders differ in which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Many people eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. There are nine main categories of muscular dystrophy that contain more than thirty specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are involved in making muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which represents about half of all cases of muscular dystrophy, affects about one in 5,000 males at birth. Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word \\"dystrophy\\" is from the Greek \\"dys\\", meaning \\"difficult\\" and \\"troph\\" meaning \\"nourish\\". Gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - Myasthenia gravis ( from Greek \`\` muscle '' , \`\` weakness '' , and Latin : gravis \`\` serious '' ; abbreviated MG ) is a neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue . In the most common cases , muscle weakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction , inhibiting the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions . Alternatively , in a much rarer form , muscle weakness is caused by a genetic defect in some portion of the neuromuscular junction that is inherited at birth as opposed to developing through passive transmission from the mother 's immune system at birth or through autoimmunity later in life . Myasthenia is treated with medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants , and , in selected cases , thymectomy ( surgical removal of the thymus gland ) . The disease is diagnosed in 3 to 30 people per million per year . Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Muscle weakness or myasthenia (my- from Greek meaning \\"muscle\\" + -asthenia meaning \\"weakness\\") is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years). - A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a nerve cell (neuron) whose cell body is located in the spinal cord and whose fiber (axon) projects outside the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands. Motor neurons' axons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors to produce effects. Types of motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons. - Muscle is a soft tissue found in most animals. Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and motion. They are primarily responsible for maintaining and changing posture, locomotion, as well as movement of internal organs, such as the contraction of the heart and the movement of food through the digestive system via peristalsis. - Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle fibers. In physiology, muscle contraction does not mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state. - Weakness or asthenia is a symptom of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. - Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be exchanged to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body. - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. - Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a long term neuromuscular disease that leads to varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. The most commonly affected muscles are those of the eyes, face, and swallowing. It can result in double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, and trouble walking. Onset can be sudden. Those affected often have a large thymus gland or develop a thymoma. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease which results from antibodies that block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the junction between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their first few months of life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or nerve conduction studies. Myasthenia gravis is generally treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, may also be used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may improve symptoms in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required. Myasthenia gravis affects 50 to 200 per million people. It is newly diagnosed in 3 to 30 per million people each year. Diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness. It most commonly occurs in women under the age of 40 and in men over the age of 60. It is uncommon in children. With treatment most of those affected lead relatively normal lives and have a normal life expectancy. The word is from the Greek \\"muscle\\" and asthenia \\"weakness\\", and the \\"serious\\". - Inflammatory myopathy (inflammatory muscle disease or myositis) is disease featuring weakness and inflammation of muscles and (in some types) muscle pain. The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs and electromyography, MRI and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). - An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolyte separates into cations and anions, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an electric potential is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases. Some gases, such as hydrogen chloride, under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides) and synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed \\"polyelectrolytes\\", which contain charged functional groups. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as \\"lytes\\". - A neuromuscular junction (or myoneural junction) is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction. - Neuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and ailments that impair the functioning of the muscles, either directly, being pathologies of the voluntary muscle, or indirectly, being pathologies of nerves or neuromuscular junctions.

Paragraph: Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

Article: The Ancient Town of Fenghuang, one of China's most well-known ancient towns, was under water as heavy rain hit the center of the country, with tens of thousands of people leaving from the area. Heavy rain and floods lasted for the past few days. Waters in the nearby Tuojiang River rose by almost one meter above warning level , causing heavy rainstorms. More than 120,000 local people and tourists have been helped to leave there because of the terrible _ . And more than 4,000 shops in the town have been shut. Several bridges on the Tuojiang River have been damaged or destroyed. Water has flowed into many bars, restaurants and hotels in its ancient town, and electricity in the ancient town has been cut off. About 128,000 people have been affected by the floods. Though the heavy rains have stopped, but the popular tourist spot remains closed for local people's safety. A shoe shop owner named Kuang said the flood was the worst the town had experienced. \\"The floods came so quickly that I didn't have time to move the shoes,\\" he said sadly. \\"The flood has led to Fenghuang old town becoming a water town.\\" said a post on a discussion page on the topic set up on Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. \\"We could only live in an old factory now where many homeless people have to stay together.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] and the situation: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock. Answer the following question: Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? The answer is:","completion":"Big Lake had less occurrences of divers drowning. Step 1: Analyze both lakes' conditions - Arrow Lake had a river flowing into it, resulting in potential freshwater and saline water layering and temperature rises as divers descend. - Big Lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity, leading to convection currents and possibly warmer water at deeper levels. Step 2: Consider the causes of drowning in each lake - Many divers drowned in Arrow Lake due to temperature shock, likely because of the rapid change in temperature as they descended through the thermocline. - For Big Lake, there is no mention of divers drowning as the unique conditions in this lake may promote convection currents which help to balance out the temperature differences as the diver descends. Step 3: Compare and conclude - Comparing both lakes, Big Lake has less occurrences of divers drowning due to its underwater conditions and the lack of any mention of drowning cases being connected to those conditions in the given situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Combine them by adding the coefficients: (-399 + 2)*s = -397*s So now, the equation becomes: -397*s = 8702 + 3208 On the right-hand side of the equation, we have two constants: 8702 and 3208.

To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable \\"s\\" which is -397: -397*s⁄(-397) = 11910⁄(-397) Since dividing a number by itself results in 1, we are left with: s = 11910⁄(-397) Now, divide the right side of the equation: s ≈ -30 So the solution to the given equation -399*s + 2*s = 8702 + 3208 is s ≈ -30."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Therefore, it would be more appropriate to evaluate the hypothesis in terms of its usefulness, and whether it offers a well-informed suggestion for travelers. In the described situation, the Northwest flight attendant strike is due to take place on the 15th, and the traveler's trip is booked for the 24th. Although the strike is scheduled for a specific date, there is an uncertainty about the potential effects of the strike, including whether it will be resolved by the 24th or if it will cause subsequent delays. Given this uncertainty, following the advice presented in the hypothesis to book a different flight to avoid the possibility of missing important events or arrangements might indeed be a valuable suggestion for travelers. It's worth noting that we cannot say for sure whether Northwest (NW) will rebook affected passengers with other airlines if the strike persists, as it depends on the airline's policies and the availability of alternative options. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively say if the hypothesis is true or false, it does offer advice that can address concerns or possible negative impacts related to the strike.

Arlen Specter switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party on Tuesday, saying he has found himself increasingly \\"at odds with the Republican philosophy.\\" Sen. Arlen Specter was expected to face a tough re-election battle in 2010. \\"This is a painful decision. I know I'm disappointing many of my colleagues,\\" he said at a news conference announcing the move. \\"The disappointment runs in both directions. \\"I'm putting principle at the top of the list,\\" he added. The switch puts Senate Democrats one vote shy of a filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats. They can reach the 60-seat mark if Al Franken holds his current lead in the disputed Minnesota Senate race. \\"As the Republican Party has moved farther and farther to the right, I have found myself increasingly at odds with the Republican philosophy and more in line with the philosophy of the Democratic Party,\\" Specter said. \\"In the course of the last several months ... I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and have found that the prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak.\\" Specter, a five-term Senate veteran, was facing what most political observers believed would have been a tough fight for the Pennsylvania GOP Senate nomination in 2010. Specter said President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would campaign for him as he runs for re-election -- now on the Democratic ticket -- in the 2010 race. Obama called Specter shortly after learning the news during his daily economic briefing in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning, according to a senior administration official. \\"You have my full support, and we're thrilled to have you,\\" Obama told Specter. Jubilant Senate Democrats also welcomed the news. Watch constituents cheer for Specter ». \\"Sen. Specter and I have had a long dialogue about his place in an evolving Republican Party,\\" Reid, D-Nevada, said in a written statement. \\"We have not always agreed on every issue, but [he] has shown a willingness to work in a bipartisan manner, put people over party and do what is right for Pennsylvanians and all Americans.\\" Reid called Specter a \\"man of honor and integrity\\" who would be welcome in the Democratic caucus. One key Senate Democrat warned that reaching the 60-vote mark would not automatically ensure a Democratic victory on every major issue. \\"It's great news,\\" North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad said. But it means \\"a lot less\\" than some people think. \\"The Democratic caucus is not homogenous. [There is a] lot of disagreement in the Democratic caucus, so this idea that it's some great watershed event ... I don't think so.\\" Neither party has had a filibuster-proof majority in the U.S. Senate since the 95th Congress, from 1977 to 1979. The Democrats controlled 62 seats during the first two years of the Carter presidency. Learn about other senators who have switched parties ». Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele ripped Specter, calling him a Republican in name only who was out of step with the rest of the party because of his \\"left-wing voting record.\\" \\"Some in the Republican Party are happy about this. I am not,\\" Steele said in a written statement. \\"Let's be honest -- Sen. Specter didn't leave the GOP based on principles of any kind. He left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record.\\" Steele said Republicans \\"look forward to beating Sen. Specter in 2010, assuming the Democrats don't do it first.\\" Steele later said Specter essentially \\"flipped the bird\\" at the GOP leadership with his decision. Speaking to CNN's Gloria Borger and Kyra Philips, the chairman said it was \\"not only disrespectful but downright rude\\" of Specter to make this decision after the national party made it clear that it would stand behind him in a contentious primary fight. Watch more of Steele's comments ». National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John \\"Cornyn went out on the line for this man,\\" he said. \\"For the senator to flip the bird back to Sen. Cornyn and the Republican Senate Leadership, a team that stood by him, who went to the bat for him in 2004, to save his hide is not only disrespectful but down right rude. \\"I'm sure his mama didn't raise him this way,\\" Steele added. Specter was expected to face a very tough primary challenge in 2010 from former Rep. Pat Toomey, who nearly defeated Specter in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary in 2004. A Quinnipiac University survey of registered Pennsylvania voters released last month showed Specter trailing the more conservative Toomey in a hypothetical primary matchup, 41 to 27 percent. Watch why Specter decided to switch ». A separate Franklin & Marshall survey showed Specter leading Toomey 33 to 18 percent. Another 42 percent, however, were undecided. More than half of the Republicans polled in the Franklin & Marshall survey said they would prefer to see someone new in the Senate. Specter singled out the conservative group Club for Growth, which endorsed Toomey in 2004 and has endorsed him for 2010, as one the primary culprits behind his increasing political isolation in the Pennsylvania GOP. He argued that the organization, which targets moderate GOP incumbents who do not adhere to the doctrine of supply-side economics, had helped undermine the competitiveness of the Republican Party across much of the country. Club for Growth members and other conservatives \\"don't make any bones about their willingness to lose the general election if they can purify the party,\\" he said. \\"I don't understand it, but that's what they say. ... There ought to be a rebellion [against them]. There ought to be an uprising.\\" But Club for Growth President Chris Chocola replied in a statement, \\"Sen. Specter has confirmed what we already knew: He's a liberal devoted to more spending, more bailouts and less economic freedom. Thanks to him, Democrats will now be able to steamroll their big government agenda through the Senate. \\"This cynical play for political survival calls into question whether Pennsylvania taxpayers can believe anything Arlen Specter says.\\" Numerous Republicans are angry with Specter over his recent vote in support of President Obama's 787 billion stimulus plan. \\"When the stimulus package came up for a vote, I felt that it was indispensable to vote aye in order to avoid the possibility of a 1929-type depression,\\" Specter said. He said that the vote highlighted a \\"schism\\" and an \\"irreconcilable conflict\\" between himself and the bulk of the GOP. Specter, one of only three GOP senators to vote for the measure, has been part of a dwindling group of GOP moderates from the northeastern part of the country. The 79-year-old Kansas native and former Philadelphia district attorney has been a leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee for much of the past two decades, serving as its chairman from 2005 to 2007. Specter has been a defender of abortion rights in an overwhelmingly anti-abortion party and opposed Reagan's controversial nomination of Robert Bork to a Supreme Court seat in 1987. But he drew criticism from many women for his aggressive questioning of law professor Anita Hill, who accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during Thomas' 1991 confirmation hearings. Specter served on the Warren Commission, which investigated the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, helping develop the so-called single bullet theory that Kennedy and Texas Gov. John Connally were hit by the same slug. He has survived bouts with cancer three times, most recently undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in 2005.

Answer this question: who sang the song big rock candy mountain??","completion":"The song \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain,\\" a folk song about a hobo's idea of paradise, a modern version of the medieval concept of Cockaigne, was originally composed and sung by Harry McClintock. Also known by his stage name Haywire Mac, McClintock was a prominent folk figure, and his ballad about a hobo's utopia quickly gained popularity. Harry McClintock, born in Nashville in 1882, established himself as a kind of jack-of-all-trades. He became an active union member, a newspaper columnist, and a radio broadcaster, but above all, he was a folk singer, hobo, and cowboy revered for his storytelling skills. Using his wisdom and experience of a life of adventure, McClintock composed songs that spoke to life's struggles through a roguish, humorous lens. These songs left a lasting imprint on American folk music. McClintock first recorded \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" in 1928. Despite being a folk masterpiece soon after its release, there was some controversy concerning its lyrics. The original lyrics detailed a hobo's paradise filled with cigarettes trees, alcohol streams, and more. However, some parts of the song were heavily censored over time to exclude references to alcohol and cigarettes to make it more suitable for all audiences. Despite these changes, McClintock's efforts, both as a singer and a songwriter, laid the foundation for the song's continued endurance. \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" has since been covered by multiple artists throughout the decades, such as Burl Ives and Tom Waits, amplifying its popularity across generations and different musical styles. The song also appeared in various films and television shows, including O Brother, Where Art Thou?, reinforcing its cultural significance and demonstrating the distinctive charm of folk music. In many ways, the song remains an emblem of McClintock's body of work, reflecting both his adventurous spirit and his sharp-eyed view of trials and tribulations of life on the road."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love.

Let's analyze the sentence in more detail and consider various possible contexts to better understand the sentiment behind it. 1. Neutral sentiment: When the sentence is used to describe a factual occurrence or an expected event, it can be perceived as neutral. For example, someone might say \\"there are lulls\\" to describe periods of less activity during a workday or in a sports game. In this context, the statement simply implies a pause in the activity, neither positive nor negative. 2. Calm sentiment: The sentence might also be seen as portraying calmness or tranquility, especially when used to describe a peaceful environment or a welcomed break. For instance, someone could use the phrase \\"there are lulls\\" when describing moments of quietness in a busy household or a serene spot amidst a bustling city. In this context, the sentiment might imply a sense of relief, rest, or serenity. 3. Reflective sentiment: In some cases, the sentence could convey a sense of introspection and reflection. When used to describe a period of pause in someone's life or during a conversation, \\"there are lulls\\" could imply an opportunity to contemplate, think deeply, or process emotions and thoughts. This sentiment might not be inherently positive or negative, as it would depend on the individual's perspective and what they are contemplating. In conclusion, how the sentiment of the sentence \\"there are lulls\\" is perceived depends largely on the context in which it is used and the intentions of the speaker or writer. It might convey a sense of neutrality, calmness, or reflection, all of which could contribute to a thoughtful atmosphere or a more measured perspective on a given situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: how to winterize windows Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Winterizing windows is essential for maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature during the colder months. It eliminates drafts and also ensures that heat does not escape from inside the house, leading to greater energy efficiency. Here are some steps to winterize windows: 1. **Inspection**: The first step is to inspect the windows for any cracks, gaps, leaks, or drafts. This is done to understand the level of work needed to winterize them. We begin with the inspection to ensure that we cover all problematic areas that might let in cold air. 2. **Cleaning**: Once inspection is done, we must clean the windows. This involves cleaning the window glass, frame, and nearby wall areas. Cleaning is important because certain winterizing materials like weatherstripping or window film won't stick properly to dirty surfaces. 3. **Weather Stripping**: It's essential to apply weatherstripping around the edges of the windows. This helps to form a barrier that prevents cold air from entering and warm air from leaving. The application of weatherstripping is a critical step in the process as it deals directly with insulating the window against drafts. 4. **Window Insulation Film**: Install window insulation film on the glass panes. This clear plastic sheet is like a second layer of glass that inhibits heat from escaping. It's mainly used on single-pane windows that provide very little insulation. Installing window film significantly increases the windows' resistance to heat flow and reduces their u-factor (the rate at which a window conducts non-solar heat flow), thereby improving insulation. 5. **Use Draft Snakes**: Draft snakes are effective at preventing air from entering through gaps at the bottom of a window. They are simple to use and can be a quick solution for drafty windows. 6. **Consider Insulated Curtains**: These special curtains have thermal properties that can help keep the heat inside your home and the cold outside. Using insulated curtains will add one more layer to preventing heat loss. By following these steps, we'll ensure a well-insulated home during the cold months and efficiently reduce heating costs. It makes sense to organize our approach to winterizing windows this way because we're systematically addressing two main concerns: sealing drafts from cracks and insulating the window to prevent heat loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your dial indicator should have an attachment that you can use to secure it to a stand. The stand will stabilize your dial indicator while you take your measurements.","completion":"After mounting your dial indicator on a stand, follow these steps to properly read and use the dial indicator: 1. Prepare the object or surface you wish to measure. Be sure it is clean, smooth, and free from grease, dirt, or any other contaminants that might affect the accuracy of your measurements. 2. Position the object or surface close to the dial indicator. Ensure that the measuring point (also known as the contact point) of the dial indicator will touch the object or surface you want to measure as perpendicularly as possible. 3. Zero the dial indicator. Before taking any measurements, spin the outer bezel of the dial indicator around the face until the zero mark is aligned with the pointer. This will ensure accuracy in your readings. Some dial indicators have a locking mechanism for the bezel to prevent any accidental movements. 4. Press the measuring point of the dial indicator against the surface of the object you are measuring. Apply a gentle pressure to ensure that the contact is secure, but not too forceful as to compress the components of the object. 5. Take note of the initial reading. The dial indicator's pointer should now give you a reading corresponding to the position of the measuring point relative to the surface of the object. This reading usually shows the displacement in thousandths of an inch or in micrometers. You might have a dial indicator with a large outer dial for major measurements (e.g., in 0.001-inch increments) and a smaller, inner dial for minor measurements (e.g., in 0.0001-inch increments). Read both dials to get an accurate measurement. 6. If you are comparing the difference in heights or depths between two surfaces, move the measuring point of the dial indicator from the first surface to the second one. Keep the dial indicator in contact with the surfaces and maintain steady pressure as you move between the two points. 7. Record the new reading on the dial indicator. This measurement will represent the difference between the two surfaces. You may need to do some basic arithmetic to determine the exact difference if the dial did not return to zero between measurements. 8. In the case of comparing multiple measurements, be sure to keep the dial indicator at the same angle and pressure for each measurement, and always zero the indicator for consistency. 9. Once you have obtained your desired measurements, carefully remove the dial indicator from the surface and detach it from the stand. 10. Clean the measuring point of the dial indicator with a clean cloth and store it in a storage case to protect it from any damage or debris. Remember, accurate measurements with a dial indicator are essential for various applications like machine alignment, quality control, and troubleshooting mechanical issues. By following these steps, you'll ensure that you're using the dial indicator correctly and achieving precise results."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Loop through the list and compare the difference of consecutive integers: i. Calculate the difference between the current integer and the next integer. ii. Calculate the absolute value of the difference. iii. Compare this absolute difference with the current 'min_difference'. iv. If the absolute difference is smaller, update 'min_difference' with the new value. d. Once the loop is done, 'min_difference' will have the minimum absolute difference between any two integers in the list. 5. Answer: Applying the above steps, we can calculate the minimum absolute difference for the list [-18, -70, 70, 91] as follows: a. Sorted list: [-70, -18, 70, 91]. b. min_difference = infinity. c. Loop through the list: i. |-70 - (-18)| = |52| (Update min_difference to 52) ii. |-18 - 70| = |88| iii. |70 - 91| = |21| (Update min_difference to 21) d. The final value of min_difference is 21. So, the answer to this task is 21, as the smallest possible absolute distance between any two integers in the list is 21."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. Why was there still a possibility of a shutdown? A. the bill was approved for too much money B. the senate still had to vote by the deadline C. the senate still had to vote when they could make arrangements D. not enough information A:","completion":"B. the senate still had to vote by the deadline"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Two siblings Jane and Matt, needed eyeglasses. Matt was nearsighted, while Jane was farsighted. they bought themselves two nice pairs of eyeglasses. and a hint : Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Please answer this question : Which sibling didn't have hyperopia?","completion":"Given the information provided, Jane is the one who had hyperopia, as she was farsighted, meaning she could see distant objects clearly but had difficulty seeing close objects.

Answer this question: When igneous rock is changed into metamorphic rock, which form of energy is this process? OPT: (A). heat; (B). chemical; (C). magnetic; (D). light;. Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine step-by-step how an igneous rock transforms into a metamorphic rock. Step 1: Understanding the formation of igneous rocks Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. They are typically found in areas where there is volcanic activity or where the Earth's mantle has pushed up through the crust. Step 2: Identifying the factors that cause rocks to undergo metamorphism Rocks undergo metamorphism when they are subjected to changes in temperature, pressure, or both, often due to movements in the Earth's crust or other geological processes. These changes cause the minerals in the rocks to re-crystallize, forming new minerals and textures, and ultimately transforming the rock into a new type. Step 3: Evaluating which of the given forms of energy is responsible for the transformation of igneous rocks into metamorphic rocks Now, let's review the given options and evaluate their relationship with the metamorphic process: A) Heat: As the primary factor causing metamorphism, heat can cause the minerals within igneous rocks to break down, rearrange, and re-crystallize, leading to the formation of metamorphic rocks. B) Chemical: Chemical changes may occur during the metamorphic process, but they are not the primary cause of metamorphism. Instead, these chemical changes are a result of the heat and pressure that the rocks are exposed to. C) Magnetic: This form of energy doesn't play a significant role in the metamorphic process. Metamorphic rocks may display changes in magnetic properties, but this is not the primary cause of the transformation. D) Light: This form of energy doesn't have an impact on the transformation of igneous rock into metamorphic rock. Based on the energy forms involved in the transformation process, we can conclude that: Answer: (A). heat"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. Now, I have a new situation: A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable.

Information: - The Sinai Peninsula or simply Sinai ('; ', ; \\"\\") is a peninsula in Egypt, situated between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, serving as a land bridge between Asia and Africa. It is the only part of Egyptian territory located in Asia. Sinai has a land area of about and a population of approximately 1,400,000 people. The bulk of the peninsula is divided administratively into two of Egypt's 27 governorates (with three more straddling the Suez Canal area). - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - Afri (singular \\"Afer\\") was a Latin name for the inhabitants of Africa, referring in its widest sense to all the lands south of the Mediterranean (Ancient Libya). Latin-speakers at first used \\"afer\\" as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of \\"Africa\\", i. e., an African. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - The African bush elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") is the larger of the two species of African elephant. - The African forest elephant (\\"Loxodonta cyclotis\\") is a forest-dwelling species of elephant found in the Congo Basin. It is the smallest of the three extant species of elephant, but still the third-largest living terrestrial animal. The African forest elephant and the African bush elephant, \\"L. africana\\", were considered to be one species until genetic studies indicated that they separated an estimated 27 million years ago. Due to a slower birth rate, the forest elephant takes longer to recover from poaching, which caused its population to fall by 65% from 2002 to 2013. - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. - So - called pygmy elephants live in both Africa and Asia . The African pygmy elephant , formerly described as \`\` Loxodonta pumilio '' , is currently considered to be a tiny morph of the African forest elephant ( L. cyclotis ) . The Borneo elephant ( Elephas maximus borneensis ) , a well - documented variety of elephant , is also called \`\` pygmy elephant . '' This elephant , inhabiting tropical rainforest in north Borneo ( east Sabah and extreme north Kalimantan ) , was long thought to be identical to the Asian elephant and descended from a captive population . In 2003 , DNA comparison revealed them to be probably a new subspecies . The term pygmy elephant should not be confused with \`\` dwarf elephant '' , which is used for a number of extinct species of elephants that evolved their size due to island dwarfing . - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. What is the relationship between 'pygmy elephant' and 'loxodonta cyclotis'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The relationship between 'pygmy elephant' and 'Loxodonta cyclotis' is that the African pygmy elephant was once considered a separate species known as 'Loxodonta pumilio'. However, recent studies have shown that the African pygmy elephant is actually a small morph of the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). So, the term 'pygmy elephant' in the African context refers to a smaller form of the African forest elephant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Eleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on August 18, 1927 in Plains, Georgia. She was the eldest of four children of Wilburn Edgar Smith, an auto mechanic and farmer, and Allethea \\"Allie\\" Murray Smith, a dressmaker. Her brothers were William Jerrold \\"Jerry\\" Smith (1929-2003), an engineer, and Murray Lee Smith (1932-2003), a teacher and minister. Her sister, Lillian Allethea (Smith) Wall (born 1936), is a real estate broker. Context: When her husband's gubernatorial term ended in January 1975, Rosalynn, Jimmy and Amy Carter returned to Plains. Jimmy had already announced his plans to run for President of the United States. Rosalynn returned to the campaign trail, this time on a national quest to gather support for her husband. She campaigned alone on his behalf in 41 states. Because of her husband's obscurity at the time, she often had to answer the question, \\"Jimmy who?\\" She promoted the establishment of additional daycare facilities and adjustments to \\"Social Security and so many other things to help the elderly.\\" During the months when she was campaigning across the country, she was elected to the board of directors of the National Association of Mental Health, honored by the National Organization for Women with an Award of Merit for her vigorous support for the Equal Rights Amendment, and received the Volunteer of the Year Award from the Southwestern Association of Volunteer Services. Rosalynn sat in the balcony at Madison Square Garden with friends and family the night of the nomination while her husband was with his mother and daughter. She had \\"butterflies in her stomach,\\" until the Ohio delegation announced its votes were for her husband. Rosalynn wished she could have been with him at that time. The Carters met with all the potential running mates, and instantly gained affinity for Walter Mondale after meeting with him and his wife Joan. Following the election, the Carters traveled to the White House and met with President Ford and First Lady Betty Ford, the latter becoming a role model for Rosalynn. Question: who was the current president? Answer:","completion":"Since you are asking about the time when Rosalynn Carter was campaigning for her husband, Jimmy Carter, the current president during that period was Gerald Ford. He was the 38th President of the United States before Jimmy Carter became the 39th President."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mark Johnson and Charles Newirth produced the film for DreamWorks Pictures. - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Weather Girl is a 2009 comedy film written and directed by Blayne Weaver .

To mark this rare astronomical event, Krispy Kreme decided to introduce a twist on their Original Glazed Doughnuts. For the very first time in the company's history, the Original Glazed Doughnuts were \\"eclipsed\\" by a chocolate glaze. Krispy Kreme used this significant occasion to provide a total sensory experience for viewers through their doughnuts. Krispy Kreme's move was also a unique marketing strategy. This chocolate glazing of the iconic Original Glazed Doughnut was likened to the experience of the solar eclipse. Fans of the doughnut giant could get their hands on these limited-edition treats on August 21, 2017, as well as during the evening \\"Hot Light\\" hours (when fresh batches are made at the Krispy Kreme bakery and the \\"Hot Light\\" sign is turned on) on August 19 and August 20. Before the release of the Chocolate Glazed Doughnuts, Krispy Kreme had launched another novelty item that already stirred excitement among its consumers: the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups doughnut. The sun turning into darkness during the eclipse and the original glazed doughnuts turning chocolate signifies Krispy Kreme's dedication to creating enjoyable and memorable experiences coupled with their dessert offerings. As explained by Jackie Woodward, the Chief Marketing Officer for Krispy Kreme at that time, \\"The Chocolate Glazed Doughnut is a delicious way to experience the solar eclipse — no matter where you are — and we can’t wait for fans to try it.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

Article: By Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump's choice for his running mate, is virtually unknown to most voters nationwide. Eighty-six percent of voters are undecided or don't know enough about him to have an opinion. Even among Republican voters, over eight in 10 are not familiar with Pence. Seven percent have a favorable view of him, while six percent view him unfavorably. Among conservatives nationwide, nine percent have a favorable view of Pence, while five percent have an unfavorable view. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll of Indiana voters conducted in April found 42 percent approved of the job Pence was doing as Governor, while 41 percent disapproved. The Veep Choice: How Important Is It? In a separate CBS News/New York Times Poll, most voters (69 percent) say a vice presidential candidate matters at least some in their vote for president, but just 30 percent say it matters a lot; another third says it doesn't really affect their presidential vote. There's little difference between Trump and Clinton supporters on this question. This poll was conducted by telephone July 8-12, 2016 among a random sample of 1,028 adults nationwide, including 841 registered voters. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of registered voters is four points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

USA TODAY's Susan Page gives you 3 things to look forward to in Cleveland. CLEVELAND — We're halfway through the Republican National Convention, and with any semblance of doubt about who will be the standard-bearer for the GOP put to rest Tuesday night (Trump officially claimed the nomination in the roll call vote), the party turns its eyes to November. And a few may be looking ahead to November 2020. Here's your viewer's guide to all the action from Cleveland on day 3, \\"Make America First Again\\" night, which is scheduled to kick off at 7:20 p.m. ET: America, meet Mike Pence Indiana Gov. Mike Pence reacts with his wife, Karen, as they arrive for a Welcome Home Rally on July 16, 2016, in Zionsville, Ind. (Photo: Darron Cummings, AP) In keeping with convention tradition, Donald Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, will get his prime-time moment on night three. While a known commodity in Washington, the Indiana governor and former congressman is largely unknown on the national stage. A CBS News poll taken this month found that 86% of were undecided or didn't know enough about him to have an opinion. For Pence's sake, he'd probably be wise not to have Trump introduce him if he wants to maximize his speaking time. On Saturday in New York, at an event ostensibly designed to introduce his vice presidential nominee to the nation, the real estate mogul talked for 28 minutes in rambling remarks that — brace yourself for this bit of shocking news — at times tended to focus more on Trump himself. Trump even felt compelled at one point to say \\"back to Mike Pence\\" to steer his own speech back to his running mate. So what will the Indiana governor's mission be Wednesday night? Pence's anti-abortion and social conservative bona fides are well established, so it's likely a major part of his speech will be spent assuring like-minded Republicans that Trump is someone they can get behind. Pence also figures to highlight the folksiness he brings to the GOP ticket, a counterbalance to the Manhattan panache of Donald J. Trump. How folksy is Mike Pence? Even in New York the Pence family dines at Chili's. Busy weekend in NY! Enjoying a quick dinner with the family at @Chilis. Looking forward to getting back to Indiana. pic.twitter.com/SUFjYcvQpH — Mike Pence (@mike_pence) July 16, 2016 Pence is likely to speak sometime after 10 p.m. ET. Conventions are about the future Yes, we're still more than three months away from the 2016 presidential election, but if you're already thinking ahead to 2020, you may get a sneak peek Wednesday. Speakers include Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a video message from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — all vanquished Trump 2016 opponents and all under-50 ambitious pols who would likely quickly turn their attention toward the 2020 White House race should the Republican presidential ticket fall short in November. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker talks to Sen. Ted Cruz during a campaign event in Madison, Wis., on April 4, 2016. (Photo: Andy Manis, AP) Notably, all three former presidential hopefuls leveled blistering attacks against Trump during the primary campaign — and he against them — so expect to hear more about why Hillary Clinton wouldn't make a good president than why Trump would. Cruz, after all, hasn't even endorsed Trump yet, and it's not clear whether he will Wednesday. But it has been months since the real estate mogul linked the Texas senator's father to the Kennedy assassination, insulted his wife's appearance and called him \\"the single biggest liar\\" he's ever encountered, so he's probably ready to give a real stemwinder on behalf of Trump. The obligatory Trump family representative Eric Trump stands on the convention floor in Cleveland on July 19, 2016. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) By the time this convention concludes, there won't be too many Trumps you haven't heard from. On Wednesday, it's Eric Trump's turn, who will give remarks following a video titled \\"My Father, Donald Trump.\\" He'll also follow a speech from Lynne Patton, who's vice president of The Eric Trump Foundation. So who is the latest member of the Trump family to address the convention? He's 32 and the third child of Donald and Ivana Trump, the billionaire's first wife. Like his two older siblings, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, he works for the Trump Organization as an executive vice president and is also president of Trump Winery. He married wife Lara Yunaska at his father's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2014. And there's Newt. Because, why not? Donald Trump and former House speaker Newt Gingrich share the stage during a campaign rally earlier this month in Ohio. (Photo: John Minchillo, AP) Newt Gingrich was a finalist to be Donald Trump's running mate and even gave up his gig at Fox News amid speculation he was under consideration. The job, of course, went to Mike Pence, but the former House speaker is still going to bat for Trump. Gingrich and his wife, Callista, are scheduled to appear before Pence in one of Wednesday night's final segments. It's arguable, to say the least, how effective Newt Gingrich will be as a surrogate who can soften Trump's edges to female voters or broaden his appeal in swing states. But hey, few people have more experience going after the Clintons that Gingrich, so expect a vintage, 1990s-era evisceration of the presumptive Democratic nominee from the man who relished going after her husband. More convention coverage from USA TODAY Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29Td1o3 ||||| The third day of the Republican National Convention kicks off Wednesday, July 20, at 7:20 pm. The third night's theme is \\"Make America First Again,\\" a much vaguer unifying principle than Monday's \\"Make American Safe Again\\" (which presaged a night full of attacks on Hillary Clinton's national security record and stern warnings about the threat of \\"radical Islamist terrorism,\\" which was always referred to by that name) and Tuesday's \\"Make America Work Again\\" (which had a business/economy theme, albeit a looser one than the national security theme of night one). But Wednesday features some of the biggest speakers of the whole convention, from failed presidential candidates (Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, a video from Marco Rubio), elder statesmen (Newt Gingrich), family members (Eric Trump), and, most importantly of all, vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, who'll get his first big chance to introduce himself as a national political figure. How to watch: C-SPAN is airing the convention, gavel to gavel. It also provides a live stream for web viewers. CNN is doing 24-hour coverage of the convention, with its normal programs such as Wolf, The Lead, and The Situation Room airing from Cleveland. CBS News and Twitter are teaming up to stream the convention live. Finally, the RNC is streaming the proceedings live on YouTube, which you can see above. The schedule: Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus is scheduled to call the convention to order at 7:20 pm; you can read the full list of speakers, who are not given set times, here. The major speakers are, in order: Laura Ingraham , talk radio host and Fox News regular Phil Ruffin , billionaire casino owner and Trump friend Pam Bondi , Florida attorney general who , Florida attorney general who solicited a Trump donation before deciding not to join New York state's investigation of Trump University. Eileen Collins , retired astronaut and first female space shuttle commander. Michelle Van Etten , a multilevel marketer behind the Alex Jones–backed nutritional supplement company Youngevity Ralph Alvarado , Kentucky state senator Darrell Scott , pastor from Cleveland Heights and notable , pastor from Cleveland Heights and notable African-American Trump supporter Harold Hamm , billionaire best known for pioneering fracking in Montana and North Dakota who famously argued he , billionaire best known for pioneering fracking in Montana and North Dakota who famously argued he made his billions due to dumb luck rather than skill to limit the amount he had to pay his ex-wife in their divorce Scott Walker , governor of Wisconsin and former presidential candidate Lynne Patton , vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation and assistant to Eric, Ivanka, and Donald Trump Jr. Marco Rubio, US senator from Florida and former presidential candidate (appearing in video) Ted Cruz, US senator from Texas and former presidential candidate Eric Trump Newt Gingrich and Callista Gingrich , former US House speaker and 2012 presidential candidate and president of Gingrich Productions, respectively Mike Pence, Indiana governor and vice presidential nominee What to expect The first set of speakers on Wednesday are allies of Trump's from the world of business, and while odds are they won't ruffle any feathers, there's potential for some wackadoo hijinks too. Michelle Van Etten, in particular, runs a highly dubious-seeming enterprise that sells supplements designed by a naturopath (not a real doctor) through a multi-level marketing system that looks rather a lot like a Ponzi scheme. She probably won't dive too deep into your business model but if she does, the whole event could take a turn toward the Dr. Oz. Then there are the runners-up. Scott Walker wasn't in the race long enough to really get bitter, but Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz got down in the mud with Trump and haven't exactly been enthusiastic backers since he defeated them. Rubio's prerecorded video should be courteous and will probably follow the \\"praise generic Republicanism, not Trump\\" approach of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. Ted Cruz will probably have more nice things to say about Trump personally, but don't expect too many fireworks there either. He knows he needs to play reasonably nice to shore up his status as frontrunner for 2020 after Trump (presumably) loses. But the real star is Mike Pence, who was denied a real chance to introduce himself at his formal unveiling this past Saturday and will now get his big national debut. Pence isn't the most compelling speaker, but he's good at talking the talk to conservative audiences. Expect him to try to vouch for the ticket's conservative bona fides, and to tie Trumpism to more traditional strands of Republicanism. ||||| Pence does it the old-fashioned way He stuck to the script, reusing familiar lines and boiling down the Trump campaign’s message into a neat sales pitch. There was no swearing and no attacking other Republicans. In other words, Mr. Pence, the governor of Indiana, gave his speech like a career politician — and it worked. Mr. Pence, overshadowed by Donald J. Trump throughout the vice-presidential rollout, used his first prominent solo performance to describe the 2016 election as a choice between a candidate of change (Mr. Trump) and “a stale agenda and the most predictable of names” in Hillary Clinton. He vouched for Mr. Trump’s moral character, calling him “the right man for these times.” After two days of meandering speeches from obscure politicians and minor celebrities, Mr. Pence brought roars of enthusiasm from the crowd and set a high bar for Mr. Trump to clear, with his more freewheeling approach, on Thursday. Cruz 2020 begins The runner-up in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, did not endorse Mr. Trump for president. He congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination but urged Americans only to vote their conscience in the fall. At one point, Mr. Cruz explicitly looked past the 2016 election. ||||| CLEVELAND — Rancor and hard-edged attacks dominated the start of the Republican National Convention on Monday as speakers branded Hillary Clinton as a liar who deserved to be in prison and two African-American Republicans ridiculed the Black Lives Matter movement. The divisive day even swept up the presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. Renegade delegates forced a floor fight in an effort to embarrass him, and his top aide called Ohio’s governor “petulant” for not endorsing Mr. Trump. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who is the chairman of the convention, also distanced himself from Mr. Trump’s approach to racial unrest and from one of his signature proposals. The unusual jousting among Republicans at their own convention gave way to more traditional, fiery speeches aimed at Democratic leaders, Mrs. Clinton and President Obama. The most impassioned remarks came from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who described an America plagued by crime and violence and repeatedly praised police officers for keeping families safe without regard to race. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The third day of the Republican National Convention saw Indiana Governor Mike Pence give his first prominent solo performance as Donald Trump's running mate. Although he stuck to the script, he reused familiar lines and essentially gave his speech like a career politician. During the evening, themes of police support dominated amid discussions about crime and violence. Ex-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani gave an impassioned speech, calling for unity against terrorism and reassuring Americans that Trump would make them safe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Question: how much year ago andy is died? Movie title: Malice Movie plot: Andy (Bill Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) are a newlywed couple living in a Victorian house that they are restoring in Western Massachusetts. He is an Associate Dean at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow), one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. With this knowledge, Tracy and Andy decide to sue Jed and the hospital.

Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. - In astronomy and navigation, the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, concentric with Earth. All objects in the observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy, allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances are unknown or unimportant. - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - A dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) is a term in astronomy applied to low luminosity galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way and to the similar systems that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). While similar to dwarf elliptical galaxies in appearance and properties such as little to no gas or dust or recent star formation, they are approximately spheroidal in shape, generally lower luminosity, and are recognized only as satellite galaxies in the Local Group. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Andromeda V is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy about 2.52 Mly away in the constellation Andromeda . Andromeda V was discovered by Armandroff et al . and published in 1998 after their analysis of the digitized version of the second Palomar Sky Survey . The metallicity of Andromeda V is above the average metallicity to luminosity ratio of the Local Group 's dwarf galaxies . - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They both seek to understand the underlying reasons behind the contagious nature of yawning. Yawning is considered to be contagious because it often triggers a reflex in people who observe another individual yawning. This phenomenon is called \\"contagious yawning.\\" There have been various theories and research studies conducted to understand this intriguing aspect of human behavior. Some of the main reasons include: 1. Social instinct: Contagious yawning may be rooted in our evolutionary history as social animals. As humans, our survival has depended on our ability to understand and interpret the emotions and intentions of those around us. One hypothesis is that we have evolved to synchronize our behaviors and emotions with those of others in our group, to facilitate cooperation and communication. Yawning may be a part of this mimicking process, which helps us bond with our group members. 2. Mirror neurons: Researchers have discovered that specific neurons in the brain, called \\"mirror neurons,\\" are responsible for our ability to mimic the actions of others. These neurons activate both when an individual performs an action and when they see someone else perform the same action. Evidence suggests that mirror neurons may be responsible for contagious yawning, as they create a strong neural response to the sight of someone else yawning. 3. Empathy: Contagious yawning has been linked to empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of empathy are more likely to experience contagious yawning. Likewise, those with lower empathy levels, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder, tend to exhibit reduced contagious yawning. This connection suggests that when we see others yawn, we either consciously or subconsciously empathize with their feelings of fatigue, boredom, or stress, which in turn makes us yawn. 4. Physiological factors: Yawning is known to regulate brain temperature, increasing blood flow, and oxygen levels in the brain. Observing someone else yawn may serve as a cue for our bodies to maintain homeostasis, prompting us to yawn in response to maintain proper brain functioning. Furthermore, the contagious nature of yawning may be evolutionarily advantageous, as it helps the entire group maintain optimal brain conditions by cueing everyone to yawn collectively. 5. Psychological factors: Another possibility is that contagious yawning is simply a learned behavior. Through repeated exposure to others yawning, we might associate yawning with feelings of fatigue, boredom, or even stress. This conditioning would make it more likely for us to yawn in response to witnessing someone else yawn. That being said, no single theory can fully explain the contagious nature of yawning, and it is likely that a combination of these factors contributes to this fascinating human behavior.

Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\\".Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car.

Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. I am facing a new situation today: Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers. Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team had people getting less oxygen to their cells? A:","completion":"A: Team two, which consisted of people with sickle-cell anemia, had people getting less oxygen to their cells. This is because their red blood cells contain hemoglobin with a mutation that causes the hemoglobin to clump together, leading to the distorted, crescent-shaped cells. These misshapen red blood cells cannot efficiently transport oxygen throughout the body, resulting in less oxygen reaching the tissues in comparison to individuals with normal red blood cell levels, as seen in team one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the question about the Treaty of Nanking or its consequences? No, it's about the Taiping Rebellion and the control of Zhejiang during that time. There is no explicit connection between the Taiping Rebellion and the text's content. 2. Is the question about Ningbo, one of the cities in Zhejiang?

Paul Ryan blasts Boehner over budget deal 'I think the process stinks,' Ryan says of the secretive talks that produced the tentative budget and debt ceiling agreement. Rep. Paul Ryan on Tuesday blasted Speaker John Boehner, Senate leadership and the White House for the secretive process they used to negotiate a two-year budget and debt ceiling agreement that appears poised to pass Congress this week. \\"I think the process stinks,\\" said Ryan, who is expected to be elected speaker on Thursday. The Wisconsin Republican added that he hadn't gone through the details of the agreement, which was released Monday night. Story Continued Below \\"This is not the way to do the people's business,\\" Ryan said. \\"And under new management we are not going to do the people's business this way. We are up against a deadline — that's unfortunate. But going forward we can't do the people's business (this way). As a conference we should've been meeting months ago to discuss these things to have a unified strategy going forward.\\" Ryan has promised major changes to the legislative process as speaker in response to complaints from conservatives. They say Boehner's style has been too top-down and crisis-driven, largely ignoring the input of committees and rank-and-file members. Ryan has been an ally of Boehner's throughout the Ohio Republican's five years as speaker. Ryan's remarks criticizing how the deal came to fruition represent his starkest public split with the man he's set to replace as Republican leader. Boehner said he wasn't a fan of the process himself. \\"Totally agree, totally agree,\\" the outgoing speaker said in response to Ryan's criticism. Parroting Ryan's own terminology, Boehner added, \\"It stinks. This is not the way to run a railroad.\\" At the same time, Boehner defended the substance of the deal, which would stave off the dual threat of a debt default and a government shutdown for more than a year. The 144-page agreement would boost spending by 80 billion over two years — split between defense and non-defense programs — and save hundreds of billions of dollars through changes to entitlement programs, including Social Security disability insurance. The measure would also forestall a large increase in Medicare premiums for some beneficiaries that was set to kick in in January. The federal government risks a first-ever default if its borrowing authority wasn't extended by Nov. 3. A little more than a month later, government funding is set to expire. The pact has broad backing in Congress among both parties, and the White House has signed off as well. Some conservatives have objected to the fact that rank-and-file members were not included in the talks, as well as to aspects of the deal, but they don't appear to have the votes to stop it from passing. \\"While it certainly is not the process I would like, remember what the alternative was. The alternative was a clean debt ceiling (bill) or default on our debt .. (and when) we got to Dec. 11, we would be facing another government shutdown. \\"So when you look at the alternative, it starts to look a whole lot better. But I would hope that the process in the future would have a little more length to it and involve more members,\\" Boehner concluded. Ryan, the likely next speaker, has not said how he'll vote on the accord, which is expected on the House floor Wednesday. The deal, however, helps Ryan immensely. It sets budget levels for two years, lifts the debt ceiling until March 2017 and removes the threat of a government shutdown until October 2016. Ryan did not negotiate the deal, and wants to put some space between himself and the accord. Many Republicans are expected to vote against it. The House Republican Conference will vote on Ryan's candidacy for speaker Wednesday and the full House will vote on the next speaker Thursday. ||||| Outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) expressed optimism about a pending bipartisan agreement on the federal budget at a news conference Oct. 27. (AP) Congressional leaders worked late into the night on Tuesday to resolve last-minute issues with the bipartisan budget agreement reached between Congressional leaders and the White House, paving the way for the House to vote as early as Wednesday on the legislation. The deal hit a snag Tuesday night after many Republicans raised questions about whether the 80 billion in spending increases in the legislation would be fully offset by spending cuts and other revenue. Conservatives continued to fight the bill throughout the night, including attempting to kill the bill in a late-night hearing of the House Rules Committee. But Republican leaders worked out last-minute fixes and the committee voted to clear the bill, setting up a possible Wednesday floor vote. Some Republicans raised concerns that the bill only includes about 75.7 billion in spending cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office, about 4 billion short of the 80 billion in spending increases. Congressional leaders amended the deal late Tuesday to resolve the discrepancy. Boehner spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said the amendment included a “technical fix” to off-budget money, known as the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, that was used to help offset some spending. “With this amendment, all budget cap relief is fully offset with mandatory spending cuts and other savings,” Schillinger said. But the amendment did not resolve additional concerns about the deal and it is unclear how much support there will be for the deal among Republicans. Conservative members testified before the committee that they were angry with both the substance of the agreement and fact that it was negotiated in secret by outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who is expected to step down later this week. Lawmakers are considering outgoing House Speaker John Boehner's plan to avert another government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling. Here's what you need to know about it. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) “It don’t feel right to me that we let the guy that’s leaving office do a budget that the rest of us have to live with, and we don’t even know where the new guy coming in stands on it,” said Rep. Curt Clawson (R-Fla.) during the late-night Rules meeting. Boehner’s likely successor, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), is said to have not been involved in the negotiations. In fact, Ryan strongly condemned the way the deal was assembled, explaining that he had yet to actually lay eyes on it. “About the process, I can say this: I think the process stinks,” Ryan said. Ryan added that “under new management,” the “people’s business” would be conducted differently. Leaders were forced to combat a long list of sticking points on Tuesday, including anger from members who opposed a reduction in crop insurance payments, which would raise 3 billion over 10 years. The top members of the House and Senate agriculture committees released a statement on Tuesday opposing it. “Make no mistake, this is not about saving money. It is about eliminating Federal Crop Insurance,” said House Agriculture Committee Chairman K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.). “The House Agriculture Committee was not consulted regarding any changes to policies under the jurisdiction of our committee.” Others were upset that Boehner negotiated the deal in secret with the White House, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). The small group kept a tight lid on the negotiations, revealing the deal only once it was complete. Earlier in the day, Boehner conceded the deal was crafted before his departure because he didn’t want the new speaker “to walk into a dirty barn full of you know what.” He agreed that the package should have been assembled in a more inclusive way, saying, “This is not the way to run a railroad.” Boehner presented the budget deal to his Republican colleagues at a private meeting Tuesday morning, outlining his plan to avert another government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling as a parting gift to his successor. The deal would increase federal spending by 80 billion over two years and raise the federal borrowing limit through 2017. The 144-page bill, which was released Monday shortly before midnight, was welcomed by Democrats who have been pushing for budget negotiations all year. “We have a budget agreement,” Boehner (R-Ohio) said after the meeting of House Republicans. Boehner, who will step down on Friday, added that the alternative was a clean debt-ceiling suspension with no extra funding for troops. “This is a good deal,” he said. [Congressional leaders, White House reach two-year budget deal] Democrats largely embraced the plan. Vice President Biden praised the deal Tuesday. “The last seven years, we’ve gone from crisis to recovery, and we’re on the verge of being able to have a genuine economic resurgence here,” Biden said. “And what we’ve put together is a good deal. No one got everything they wanted. But it will last for two years and it will prevent us from lurching from crisis to crisis.” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday that the agreement reaches the issues that were important to Republicans, including more money for defense programs and offsetting funding increases through spending cuts rather than tax increases. “I’m hopeful and optimistic that that bill will come over to the Senate, and when it does, we’ll take it up,” McConnell said. Early indications are that key Senate Republicans are also on-board. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said he will support the budget deal because “it restores all but 5 billion of the defense requirements.” He said that if the budget agreement passes he could move quickly to adjust and pass the National Defense Authorization Act that was recently vetoed by President Obama over budget concerns. McCain’s backing all but ensures the support of other defense hawks, including Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), a GOP presidential candidate. “We’re in a box here,” Graham said. “But if Senator McCain is okay with it, then I’ll probably be okay with it.” [Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post’s new political tipsheet] Following the meeting Tuesday morning, some conservatives complained that the negotiations were conducted without the input of committee chairs and rank-and-file members. But they’re unlikely to have the numbers to derail the pact as long as Democrats and moderate Republicans stay onboard. “I don’t know if this thing could pass,” said Rep. John Fleming (R-La.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “It could break apart, and we could begin tackling this piecemeal well into Paul Ryan’s speakership.” Centrists such as Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said that the deal isn’t perfect but that it prevents default and gives certainty to the military while making long-term reforms to Social Security and Medicare. “I think it’s a pretty easy choice to make,” Cole said. “It’s a compromise and that means we had to give some things up that we don’t want, but we got some great things.” Pelosi embraced the agreement Tuesday morning, signaling that the 188 House Democrats could provide a large portion of the vote needed to get a majority in the House. “The bipartisan budget package unveiled last night represents real progress for hard-working families across the country,” Pelosi said. “I look forward to working toward House passage of this proposal this week. Next, we must move forward to complete the appropriations for FY2016 and keep government open.” If Pelosi and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) can deliver votes from most, if not all, of their members, Boehner will have to win the support of only about 40 to 50 Republicans to pass the deal. It would also take the pressure off Ryan. Conservatives will be closely watching whether Ryan supports the deal. “I hope Paul Ryan will let us know how he feels about the process,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said Monday after a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. [Can Paul Ryan disarm the Freedom Caucus?] White House officials also weighed in to back the proposal. “The agreement reached by congressional leaders last night meets these key tests: It provides substantial relief from harmful spending cuts, and it does so equally on the defense and non-defense sides of the budget,” one White House official said in an e-mail. The deal isn’t a complete victory for Democrats, who were pushing for even more spending increases and hoped to pass an increase in the federal borrowing limit without including it in a broader budget deal. Obama has insisted that the debt limit not be used as a negotiating tool for spending cuts. The deal allows Obama to say he secured a bargain on a scale that has not been seen since the 2013 agreement between Ryan and the Senate Budget Committee’s then-chairman, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). Democrats still get to celebrate a messaging victory and will probably take credit for the deal. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a member of leadership, pointed out that the proposal is the kind of spending agreement he and other Democrats have been promoting. “For months, we Democrats have asked for a budget that increases spending significantly above sequester levels and does so in a way that is equally balanced between defense and key middle-class programs,” Schumer said. “This agreement does both.” The agreement includes about 80 billion in spending increases over two years, divided equally between defense and domestic programs, with 50 billion in new spending in the first year and 30 billion in the second. Those increases would be paid for with savings from changes to the Social Security Disability Insurance fund and Medicare payments to doctors and other health-care providers. New revenue would be raised by auctioning off portions of the government-owned broadcast spectrum, selling oil from the strategic oil reserve and cracking down on audits of large business partnerships. It also includes an additional 16 billion over two years from off-budget spending increases from the Overseas Contingency Operations fund. That portion would not need to be offset, but Democrats previously opposed using the money for defense-only spending. In addition, a premium increase for Medicare Part B recipients would be prevented from going into effect. Mike DeBonis and Paul Kane contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"Paul Ryan, current front-runner for Speaker of the House, has criticized the outgoing Speaker, John Boehner, for the secretive process used to negotiate the two-year budget and debt ceiling agreement, which is set to pass Congress this week.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hippolytus of Rome (170 - 235 AD) was one of the most important 3rd-century theologians in the Christian Church in Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. As a presbyter of the church at Rome under Pope Zephyrinus (199 - 217 AD), Hippolytus was distinguished for his learning and eloquence. It was at this time that Origen of Alexandria, then a young man, heard him preach. He accused Pope Zephyrinus of modalism, the heresy which held that the names Father and Son are simply different names for the same subject. Hippolytus championed the Logos doctrine of the Greek apologists, most notably Justin Martyr, which distinguished the Father from the Logos (\\"Word\\"). An ethical conservative, he was scandalized when Pope Callixtus I (217 - 222 AD) extended absolution to Christians who had committed grave sins, such as adultery. Hippolytus himself advocated an excessive rigorism. At this time, he seems to have allowed himself to be elected as a rival Bishop of Rome, and continued to attack Pope Urban I (222 - 230 AD) and Pope Pontian ( 230 - 235 AD). G. Salmon suggests that Hippolytus was the leader of the Greek-speaking Christians of Rome. Allen Brent sees the development of Roman house-churches into something akin to Greek philosophical schools gathered around a compelling teacher. Under the persecution at the time of Emperor Maximinus Thrax, Hippolytus and Pontian were exiled together in 235 AD to Sardinia, likely dying in the mines. It is quite probable that, before his death there, he was reconciled to the other party at Rome, for, under Pope Fabian (236-250), his body and that of Pontian were brought to Rome. The so-called chronography of the year 354 (more precisely, the Catalogus Liberianus, or Liberian Catalogue) reports that on August 13, probably in 236 AD, the two bodies were interred in Rome, that of Hippolytus in a cemetery on the Via Tiburtina, his funeral being conducted by Justin the Confessor. This document indicates that, by about 255 AD, Hippolytus was considered a martyr and gives him the rank of a priest, not of a bishop, an indication that before his death the schismatic was received again into the Church. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What happened to them?","completion":"Hippolytus and Pontian were sent away to a faraway place called Sardinia by an emperor named Maximinus Thrax. They had to work in difficult places called mines, and it is believed that they died there. Before they died, they probably became friends with the people they used to argue with in Rome. Later, their bodies were brought back to Rome and they were considered as heroes or martyrs for the Christian people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Pfeiffer was born in Santa Ana, California, the second of four children of Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor, and Donna (nee Taverna), a housewife. She has one elder brother, Rick (born 1955), and two younger sisters, Dedee Pfeiffer (born 1964), a television and film actress, and Lori Pfeiffer (born 1965). Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. Pfeiffer chose to begin the process of dissolving her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas. In the Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath (2000), Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office in July 2000, and went on to gross US291 million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), opposite Sean Penn. Despite grossing 97.8 million worldwide, the movie received unfavorable reviews; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \\"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland cliches that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever\\". Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: \\"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material\\". Pfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist named Ingrid Magnussen in the drama White Oleander (2002), alongside Alison Lohman (in her film debut), Renee Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was an arthouse success and Pfeiffer garnered a substantial amount of critical praise; Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described her as \\"incandescent,\\" bringing \\"power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator\\" in a \\"riveting, impeccable performance\\". She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was \\"too sexual,\\" then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \\"You know, you really can fire me\\", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.

Bob Graham's seat, with polls showing a close race between Republican hopefuls Mel Martinez and Bill McCollum. Betty Castor was leading the field of three prominent Democrats.","completion":"Topic: U.S Senate Election in Florida The U.S Senate election in Florida took place on Tuesday, as voters headed to the polls to choose the candidates who will be competing for the seat left vacant due to the retirement of Democratic Senator Bob Graham. This election has generated significant interest, as the outcome will have a considerable impact on the balance of power within the U.S Senate, as well as on the political landscape in the state of Florida. Two Republican candidates, Mel Martinez and Bill McCollum, are locked in an intense race, with polls indicating that the contest is too close to call. On the Democratic side, Betty Castor has emerged as the frontrunner, leading the three prominent Democratic contenders. Mel Martinez, former U.S Housing and Urban Development Secretary under President George W. Bush, is one of the leading Republican candidates to replace Senator Bob Graham. Martinez has the support of many establishment Republicans, as well as the endorsement of the President. His campaign is mainly centered around his experience in government and public service, as well as his conservative values. Bill McCollum, a former Florida Congressman and Attorney General, is the other prominent Republican candidate in this race. McCollum has previously run for the U.S Senate and is considered a strong contender, with significant name recognition and support within the state. His campaign highlights his experience in Congress, where he served for two decades, and his commitment to fiscal responsibility and national security. On the Democratic side, Betty Castor, a former Florida Education Commissioner and State Senator, is leading the field. Castor has a strong background in education, having served as President of the University of South Florida, in addition to her experience in the state legislature. Her campaign is focused on improving education, expanding access to quality healthcare, and advocating for women's rights. The Florida U.S Senate election is set to be a closely watched race, given the implications it will have on control of the U.S Senate. With polls showing a tight contest between Republicans Mel Martinez and Bill McCollum, and Democrat Betty Castor emerging as the frontrunner, the final result remains uncertain. Factors, such as voter turnout, campaign momentum, and regional dynamics, may all play a crucial role in determining the outcome of this critical election. Ultimately, the winning candidate will have the responsibility of representing the diverse interests of the people of Florida in the U.S Senate."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question 2: How can I not be alone and shy anymore? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answer to these two questions would be similar, as both questions deal with overcoming shyness and loneliness. However, I will provide a detailed and long answer that addresses both aspects, social connection and confidence-building techniques, to ensure that the response covers all aspects raised by these questions. 1. Improve self-confidence: The first step in overcoming shyness is to build self-confidence. Recognize your strengths, embrace your weaknesses, and know that no one is perfect. Start by setting small, achievable goals and work toward them. As you meet these goals, your confidence will grow. 2. Develop social skills: Begin by learning appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication skills, such as maintaining eye contact, smiling, and speaking clearly. Additionally, it can be helpful to learn conversational skills, such as open-ended questions and active listening. 3. Join clubs or organizations: Participate in clubs, organizations, or groups where people share the same interests as you. These environments create opportunities to engage in social interactions. Regularly participate in their activities, as it will increase your chances of building connections and overcoming shyness. 4. Volunteer: Offering your time and skills through volunteering allows you to interact with others and contribute positively to the community. The shared purpose of helping others can make it easier to form new connections and boost your confidence. 5. Practice social situations: Rehearsing social interactions can lessen anxiety due to unfamiliarity. You can practice with family or friends or role-play situations that make you feel shy. This preparation can make real-life social interactions feel more comfortable. 6. Gradually increase social exposure: Begin by attending events or gatherings where you feel comfortable. Then, step by step, try moving out of your comfort zone. For example, attend a party where you may not know many people or join a conversation among strangers. 7. Seek professional help: If your shyness is significantly affecting your daily life, consider seeking professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide personalized guidance and resources to help you work through your shyness and social anxiety. 8. Adopt a growth mindset: Embrace challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth and development. Understand that every social interaction, whether successful or not, is a chance to learn and improve. 9. Develop hobbies and passions: Having interests outside of work or school not only gives you something to talk about in social situations but also helps you feel more accomplished and confident in your abilities. 10. Be patient and persistent: Overcoming shyness and building meaningful connections takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and maintain a positive attitude. Remember, even small steps are progress. Keep working towards your goal, and eventually, you will find it easier to connect with others. By addressing both shyness and loneliness, you can work towards a more fulfilling social life. It's essential to be persistent, take small steps and, if needed, seek professional help.

This collective of artists and performers engages in provocative public performances, blending punk rock music and political activism. The group primarily focuses on themes such as feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, democracy, and opposition to the prevailing political regime in Russia. On February 21, 2012, five members of Pussy Riot entered Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and performed an impromptu \\"punk prayer\\" titled \\"Holy Shit.\\" The prayer was a direct protest against the close relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Putin regime, focusing on the church's support for Putin during his election campaign. The event sparked international coverage, and a video of the performance quickly went viral on social media platforms. The controversial performance led to the arrest of three Pussy Riot members: Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina, and Yekaterina Samutsevich. They were charged with \\"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred.\\" On August 17, 2012, after a highly publicized trial, the three women were found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison. The harsh sentencing provoked protests and criticism from human rights organizations, artists, and political leaders worldwide. During their time in prison, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina used their platform to shed light on the harsh conditions of Russian prisons and advocate for prisoners' rights. They were eventually released in December 2013, as part of a broader amnesty which was widely perceived as a public relations gesture by the Russian government, ahead of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Since their release, the members of Pussy Riot have continued to advocate for various social and political causes, using their unique style of protest art to draw attention to pressing issues. They remain one of the most recognized feminist and political activist groups in Russia and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to German: Processing power is also fixed in another way: it is finite.","completion":"Die Rechenleistung ist auch auf eine andere Weise begrenzt: sie ist endlich. Hier ist eine detaillierte und lange Antwort auf die Übersetzung der gegebenen Aussage ins Deutsche: Rechenleistung ist ein grundlegender Bestandteil von Computern und anderen Geräten, die digitale Informationen verarbeiten. Sie bezieht sich auf die Fähigkeit eines Systems, Berechnungen und Aufgaben durchzuführen und dabei eine bestimmte Menge an Ressourcen wie Zeit, Energie und physische Komponenten zu verwenden. Der Begriff \\"Rechenleistung\\" kann sich auf die Geschwindigkeit beziehen, mit der ein Computer oder ein anderes Gerät Daten verarbeiten kann, sowie auf die Anzahl der Operationen, die es gleichzeitig ausführen kann. Die oben genannte Übersetzung lautet auf Deutsch: \\"Die Rechenleistung ist auch auf eine andere Weise begrenzt: sie ist endlich.\\" Dies bedeutet, dass die Rechenleistung, die ein Gerät zur Verfügung hat, nicht unendlich ist und einen bestimmten Höchstwert hat. Es gibt mehrere Gründe dafür: 1. Physische Begrenzungen: Die Größe und Architektur der Hardwarekomponenten eines Geräts, wie z.B. Prozessoren, Speichermodule und integrierte Schaltkreise, bestimmen seine Rechenleistung. Da diese Komponenten physische Größen- und Raumgrenzen haben, können sie nur eine begrenzte Menge an Ressourcen für die Datenverarbeitung bereitstellen. 2. Energieverbrauch: Die Rechenleistung eines Geräts ist auch durch die Menge an Energie begrenzt, die es verbrauchen kann. Höherer Energieverbrauch führt zu mehr Abwärme, die wiederum gekühlt werden muss. Daher müssen Hersteller von Computern und anderen Geräten einen Kompromiss finden, um die Rechenleistung zu maximieren, während sie den Energieverbrauch und die damit verbundenen Temperaturen unter Kontrolle halten. 3. Technologische Grenzen: Bei der Entwicklung von Hardwarekomponenten stößt man immer wieder auf technologische Herausforderungen, die die Steigerung der Rechenleistung erschweren. Zum Beispiel verlangt das Erreichen immer kleinerer Größen bei der Halbleiterfertigung neuartige Materialien und Techniken, um die Leistungsfähigkeit der Bauteile zu erhalten oder weiter zu verbessern. 4. Softwarebasierte Begrenzungen: Die Fähigkeit eines Systems, seine verfügbare Rechenleistung effektiv zu nutzen, hängt auch von der Qualität der Software ab, die darauf ausgeführt wird. Schlecht optimierte Software kann zu unnötigem Ressourcenverbrauch und einer reduzierten Gesamtleistung führen. Angesichts dieser Begrenzungen ist es wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Rechenleistung eines Geräts endlich ist und eine ständige Weiterentwicklung und Optimierung von Hardware und Software erforderlich ist, um die Leistungsfähigkeit von Computern und anderen digitalen Geräten zu verbessern."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick, I said \\"I have to watch this movie\\". She's the undisputed main character, Domino, a bounty hunter. Her \\"job\\", as the \\"no action\\" scenes would teach us, reflects her rebel, violent attitude to life. I have to admit that it's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. So, this stomped me a bit. Anyway, for all the John Woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand. The cast is absolutely brilliant. Going beyond Keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, Mickey Rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.Let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. The talk show scene is \\"disgustingly\\" real. Anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. As well as the producer, when Domino's mom says that the reality that should show Domino's life is \\"trash; no offense\\", he answers \\"I don't take it like an offense\\". This movie portrays a difficult life. Domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, Ed (Mickey Rourke), a bounty hunter \\"not so bounty\\", Choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using Ed's words), \\"the correctional institutes he's been\\", and Alf, the driver/bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation. This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born \\"without the shirt\\"; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. The intro of the movie says that it is \\"inspired by true story . . . more or less\\", so I couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. Anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been \\"added\\" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be \\"edulcorated\\". The interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring. What hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (Lucy Liu, sober as never in her acting career). It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). Probably, the only \\"con\\", in a movie with a lot of \\"pros\\". All in all: This isn't \\"SWAT\\". The characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape. They have a name and a surname (not just \\"Gamble\\" and \\"Street\\"). It's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet. Question: is it a negative review? A:","completion":"Part 1: Identify the sentiment of the movie review. Usage: The sentiment in this review appears to be positive. The reviewer praises the movie for its cast, realistic portrayal of characters and situations, good character interaction, and interesting story. They only express one negative point about the role of the psychiatrist. Overall, it is a positive review. Part 2: Determine if the question asks if the review has positive or negative sentiment. Usage: The question asks, \\"is it a negative review?\\". In this case, the question is about negative sentiment. Part 3: Compare the sentiment of the review with the sentiment inquired about in the question. Usage: As the review has a positive sentiment, and the question asks about a negative sentiment, they do not match. Part 4: Generate an answer based on the comparison. Usage: Since the sentiment inquired in the question does not match the sentiment of the review, the answer is \\"no\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: \\"Whos genome has junk DNA, prokaryote or human?\\" Context: \\"Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Human genomes contain junk DNA, unlike prokaryotes. In the context provided, there is a comparative analysis between the genomes of prokaryotes and those of eukaryotes. It highlights the distinction that eukaryotic genomes often contain regions of DNA with no discernible function, a phenomenon not generally observed in the gene-dense chromosomes of prokaryotes. The term \\"junk DNA\\" has been widely used to describe these apparently nonfunctional regions of DNA. While simple single-celled eukaryotes possess relatively small amounts of such DNA, it makes up the majority of the genomes of complex multicellular organisms like humans. However, it is essential to note that recent analyses have challenged the notion that these non-coding DNA regions should be labeled as \\"junk.\\" According to current scientific understanding, only around 2% of the human genome encodes for proteins, but roughly 80% of the DNA bases may still be expressed in one way or another. It means that the term \\"junk DNA\\" could be misleading, as these non-coding regions may actively participate in crucial gene regulation processes, structural organization, and other aspects of genomic functionality. To recap, the human genome contains what has historically been referred to as junk DNA, whereas, prokaryotes do not have this phenomenon. However, caution must be exercised when using the term \\"junk DNA,\\" since these regions may play a more significant role in the overall functionality and regulation of the genome than previously presumed."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. After reading the above, is \\"It used to be the best in the world, and his plan will help restore that accolade\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What assertion did President Obama make about the country's infrastructure?\\"?","completion":"Yes, that's right!

William and Kate’s royal wedding: British monarchy’s new era is sealed with a kiss More than any other moment, it symbolized the turning of a page for the British monarchy, of a new generation of kings and queens who would, perhaps, stand somewhat closer to the people. After a majestic wedding in Westminster Abbey that comforted a nation in tough times and celebrated what it means to be British, the lofty royal family greeted the throngs outside the palace on a balcony shared by the beaming bride, the descendant of coal miners and daughter of run-of-the-mill Brits made good. Although polls showed one in three here claiming no interest in the royal wedding, the spirit of the moment appeared to become infectious. An estimated crowd of 1 million lined the central London procession route between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, besting the outpouring of 600,000 for the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer. “I cannot tell you how proud I am today to be British, and how I felt when I heard them say, ‘I do,’ ” said Alice Morley, 18, draping herself in the Union Jack outside Buckingham Palace. “. . . And with Kate, who is one of us, a commoner, I feel closer to them, like anyone can be in that palace.” Kate is not, in fact, a princess yet — at least not in official title. Instead, at the bequest of Queen Elizabeth II, the couple will now be known as Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The peculiarities of British titles kicked off a day that began with the pomp and circumstance of old royalty and ended with a bow to youth: disco dancing at the wedding reception in Buckingham Palace. The BBC reported more than 5,500 traditional street parties across the nation, with the wedding seeming to generate a patriotic fervor and a toast to the quirky notion of Britishness. Britons held duck races. They attended “fancy-dress parties” where men wore women’s clothes. They gorged on pork pies in the park and drank bitter Pimm’s and lemonade. Why? Because that’s how the British have fun. At a street party in east London punctuated by men in wedding dresses, Steve Edge, a 53-year-old owner of a design agency, said that “subconsciously everybody loves” the monarchy, an institution he called the “true brand of Englishness.” You can see it, he said, “on days like today . . . with over a billion people watching” and his countrymen suddenly dropping their famed reserve. “The English can be very dour, not get too excited, but on special occasions they do it very well.” Around the world, the wedding seemed to be helping the British build a new empire of love, with up to 2 billion estimated to be tuning in to Westminster Abbey. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text highlights the significance of William and Kate's royal wedding in signaling a new era for the British monarchy and bridging the gap between the royal family and the people. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey, drawing an estimated crowd of 1 million people along the procession route, which is larger than the crowd of 600,000 at Prince Charles and Diana Spencer's wedding. Kate Middleton, a commoner with a modest background, brings a sense of relatability and connection to the royal family. Despite polls showing that one in three people in Britain claimed no interest in the royal wedding, the event became a source of national pride and celebration of British identity. The couple will be known as Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as per Queen Elizabeth II's bequest.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity....

He believes weird creatures are lurking, just waiting to attack him. He believes that the only thing keeping him safe is his house. When his parents decide to move, Willy isn't thrilled with the idea of going to a new school and living in a strange home. One day, Gooby, a teddy bear that Willy had as a little boy, arrives at the new house. This version of Gooby is nearly six feet tall, able to talk, and wants to help; Willy decides that the two will be friends, but he must hide Gooby from his parents. Left alone for long hours while Willy goes to school, Gooby is frequently bored. He passes the time by causing trouble, convincing the nanny that there are critters inside the house, stealing cookies from the kitchen, ransacking the garage for parts to build Willy's fantasy racer and sneaking around Willy's school where anyone could see him. When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by Mr. Nerdlinger, a children's book writer who desperately wants to become famous.

I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.

They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. Question: Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? Options: A: Trees gain a growth ring each day.

John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However, bridge building experts throughout the world thought this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea, but Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. \\"We told them so.\\" \\"Crazy men and their crazy dreams.'' \\"It's foolish to chase wild visions.\\" Evcryone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap, Washington was never discouraged. One day he was lying on his bed in hospital, seeing the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment with the sunlight streaming through the windows, and a gentle breeze bowing the flimsy white curtains apart when an idea hit him. He decided to make the best use of the only finger he could move. Thus, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm until the bridge was finally completed.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device It found more than a third (35%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped, and 8% said they had taken steroids. Half believe performance enhancing substance use is \\"widespread\\" among those who play sport competitively. Ukad chief Nicole Sapstead described the figures as \\"incredibly alarming\\". A BBC State of Sport investigation into doping in UK amateur sport also found that 49% thought performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) were \\"easily available\\" among people who play sports regularly. According to figures from UK Anti-Doping (Ukad), the national body responsible for protecting clean sport, there are currently 52 athletes and coaches serving bans. Of these, only 12% are professional sports men or women; 62% are amateurs, 21% are semi-professional, and 5% are coaches. Of the 186 sanctions handed out across 22 separate sports by Ukad since it formed in 2009, 46% have been rugby union or league players - mainly at amateur and semi-professional levels. Reacting to the ComRes poll for BBC Sport of more than 1,000 men and women who are members of sports clubs and teams, Sapstead said: \\"Certainly the figures as regards the prevalence of performance-enhancing substances at an amateur level are incredibly alarming. \\"That said, it does confirm what UK Anti-Doping has long suspected and also seen through some of our intelligence-led testing. \\"I don't think any sport can say that they don't have a problem at an amateur level. \\"I think now is the time for everybody to sit up and acknowledge that this is a reality in every single sport and that you can't just be washing your hands of it or hoping that someone else will address it.\\" Sapstead also told BBC Sport: Media playback is not supported on this device Of the 79 people interviewed who had specifically taken anabolic steroids, 41% said improving performance was the main reason for taking them, followed by pain relief (40%) and improving how they look (34%). However, when this is widened out to include those who admitted taking other performance-enhancing substances, boosting results was no longer the primary reason. Only 25% of users overall claim they have taken substances with the intention of improving performance. Over half say they were primarily used for pain relief, while 17% say they were used to improve looks. \\"I think there are clearly a group of individuals seeking to enhance their performance by taking prohibited substances,\\" said Sapstead, \\"and then there are others who were taking these substances because they have a body image problem, or actually because they think it's the done thing.\\" Younger people are the main users of anabolic steroids in amateur sport, according to the poll for BBC Sport. Among sports club members aged 18-34, 13% say they have taken steroids to support performance or recovery while playing. Not one interviewee aged 55 or over said they had used anabolic steroids. However, users aged between 35 and 54 are significantly more likely than those aged 18-34 to say pain relief is among the main reasons they have used steroids or other sports supplements. But there is hardly any difference in gender, with 9% of men admitted taking steroids, compared with 8% of women. And 71% of all those polled said they would not know where to get hold of anabolic steroids. Using steroids for image reasons is a \\"worrying\\" problem among young people in Wales, according to the nation's social services and public health minister Rebecca Evans, who said in January: \\"It's not just a problem in sport - it is a wider societal issue.\\" According to the poll, a wide range of substances - both legal and illegal - are taken by amateur sports men and women to support their performance or recovery. Performance-enhancing substances can also include recreational drugs and prescribed medications: We also asked people about other substances they consumed while playing sport, including: energy drinks (68% had), pain-relief gels (60%), over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (59%) and protein shakes (46%). Media playback is not supported on this device Former amateur cyclist Dan Stevens was banned after refusing a test in 2014. He turned whistleblower but labelled Ukad's handling of his information \\"a catastrophic failure\\". Responding to the BBC Sport poll, Stevens, 41, said: \\"I think it is widespread in all ranks. I think it is widespread in celebrity, I think it is widespread in the beauty industry; I think it is certainly widespread in the sports industry. \\"I also think it is just a way of modern day life - we are living in a pharmacised world.\\" Stevens said he took thyroxine and testosterone on prescription, and EPO out of \\"curiosity\\". \\"I'd always been a clean athlete and this situation happened to me when I was 39 years old. That was enough to see a huge, huge gain. \\"But the real thing for me wasn't really about racing - I didn't do a lot of racing on these substances. The main thing was curiosity. \\"I don't think in the amateur ranks it is about winning. You've got a situation where someone is overweight, a little bit fat, need to lean down, get in shape. And they get in shape. \\"They then get railroaded into doing a marathon or a long bike ride or some kind of competitive event and they improve their fitness levels again and they become a healthier individual and become more body conscious and more health-orientated.\\" More than a third of people (36%) who report consuming recreational drugs to support their performance while playing amateur sport have also taken steroids. Dr Lambros Lazuras, an assistant professor of social psychology at Sheffield Hallam University who studies doping behaviour, told BBC Sport that there is a \\"pill-taking culture\\" in amateur sport and general society, which can act as a \\"gateway\\" to stronger substances. \\"There are people who engage in stacking practices, using as many as 10 substances at the same time,\\" he explained. \\"For these people, it's not what they use anymore, it's what they want to achieve.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device \\"The use of steroids, for example, has been associated with problems like heart disease, kidney failure and even sudden death,\\" said Dr Lazuras. \\"You're not just cheating, you're putting your life at risk. \\"This is an emerging public health issue,\\" claimed Dr Lazuras. \\"You're using substances that are meant to treat diseases, and you're actually misusing them without any prescription. \\"We push people into exercise because we want to promote the health benefits. We forget that people in most exercise settings might consider using substances. \\"This is actually the dark side of exercise. You don't care about your health anymore. You care about your performance and how you look to other people - or yourself.\\" A British weightlifter who has served a doping ban told BBC Sport steroid abuse is rife at all levels in his sport and that the culture starts at amateur level. \\"It begins in the gym,\\" the weightlifter, who wishes to remain anonymous, said. \\"In weightlifting it gets to the point where you're not growing anymore. You can train, train, train and not get anywhere. \\"Every weightlifter will take steroids. Some of them are taking light stuff and some of them are really heavily using steroids - it all depends how much money you have. \\"Is it easy to buy bread in the shop? That's how easy it is to get steroids in the UK. \\"If you're not taking steroids, basically you're nowhere in the competition, you're not going to get anywhere really. \\"I'm really proud of how they fight steroids in England. But the problem is, why are England losing? England won't cheat. \\"I've been caught because I didn't think that somebody would come to my house. I left taking steroids one month before competition and I never ever thought somebody would come to my house and test.\\" \\"I can't do something that I really love. Only because I've been cheating with steroids, come on. It's like I killed somebody. I'm not even an Olympic sportsman.\\" Lewis Conlin, 32, a publisher from Buckinghamshire, used a supplement containing the banned substance DMAA when he started weight-training in his early 20s. DMAA is an amphetamine-derived substance banned from sale in the UK and named on Wada's prohibited list. It has been linked with high blood pressure, tightening of the chest, stroke, heart attacks and even death, according to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. \\"In terms of the energy and focus that I got, it was the best pre-workout supplement I'd ever had,\\" Conlin, who was weight-training four or five days per week with friends, told BBC Sport. \\"You felt invincible, you felt you could do anything, you were just completely zoned out. You'd stare at a weight and go and lift it. That was great. Afterwards wasn't so great. \\"About three hours later you would have a crash and you'd have a real comedown. I'd be depressed and I'd be ratty, happy just to keep myself in isolation and then later on that day I was getting chest pains. \\"I would have trouble sleeping and would have heart palpitations - but that didn't actually stop me from taking it the next day. The training I was doing was so high and so intense I just wanted to have that every day. \\"Had I known at the time exactly what DMAA did to your blood pressure and your heart rate then there is no way I would have carried on taking it.\\" More drug testing among amateur sports people is a \\"waste of time\\", according to one amateur cyclist who received a two-year ban for missing a post-race drugs test. It would cost too much money and detract from focusing on drug use in the professional ranks, he added. \\"I don't see the point at all,\\" said the Briton, who asked to remain anonymous. \\"What effect is it going to have on anything, unless it is something like a national championship where people can move on in the professional ranks and actually earn a living from it? It is a problem then because you're actually affecting people's lives. In my opinion more testing would be just a waste of time at low level sport \\"How far do you go - do you want to test people for doing a fun run? It's up to them if they want to do whatever they want to do, in my opinion,\\" he said. \\"If you want to catch someone then catch the right people - like the people that win the Tour de France and get away with it. \\"But then that's too much politics and money involved. They would rather get someone that doesn't mean anything because it is easy.\\" Ukad has an annual budget of around £7m, mainly state funding. A single drug test costs around £350. Ukad directs the vast majority of its testing to elite sport, with Sapstead saying: \\"I would love to able to address the issues that we see at an amateur level, but the reality is we just don't have the resources to do that. \\"I strongly believe a further investment needs to be paid from sport, whether that's from a levy on ticket sales - some contribution into a greater integrity pot of money, that's distributed not just to anti-doping, but anti-corruption bodies. \\"Someone somewhere needs to put their hand in their pocket and their money where their mouth is, and start to help pay for us to do this job, and do it as effectively and efficiently as possible. \\"Cheating impacts against the people you are competing against. So it doesn't matter if you're an Olympian, or a Paralympian, and it doesn't matter if you don your trainers at a weekend for a fun run. \\"Actually, you're competing, and therefore it absolutely matters that everyone is toeing the line and playing a fair game.\\" BBC Sport - using ComRes to conduct the poll - interviewed 1,025 British adults, who are members of sports clubs, teams or gyms, online, between 27 and 31 January 2017. The data was drawn from a nationally representative sample of British adults aged 18 or over and the full tables are available here.

At the time, bin Laden was lesser known to the general public but was on the FBI's Most Wanted list for his role in the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Clinton was in Melbourne, speaking to a small group of business leaders on Sept. 10, 2001, and he was asked about terrorism. \\"I’m just saying, you know, if I were Osama bin Laden — he’s a very smart guy, I've spent a lot of time thinking about him — and I nearly got him once,” Clinton says in the recording. \\"I nearly got him. And I could have killed him, but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children, and then I would have been no better than him. And so I just didn't do it.\\" The recording was lost and forgotten about until last week, when Michael Kroger, the former head of the Liberal Party in the Australian state of Victoria, remembered he had the tape, and Sky News in Australia played it on Thursday.

Only 10 hours before the first plane struck the World Trade Center, Clinton explained at a conference in Melbourne that when he was President, he let the chance to kill Bin Laden pass because the operation would have also killed hundreds of innocent civilians in Afghanistan,according to a Sky News Australia report. The Clinton administration purportedly had several chances to take out Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, but passed on them. Clinton has never before discussed his role in missing out on killing the terrorist leader so candidly. (AP) “I’m just saying, you know, if I were Osama Bin Laden — he’s a very smart guy, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about him — and I nearly got him once,” Clinton says on the recording of his speech. “I nearly got him. And I could have killed him, but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children, and then I would have been no better than him.” “And so I didn’t do it,” the former commander-in-chief adds. The Sept. 10, 2001, speech was recorded with Clinton’s permission but the audio was never released until one of the men in attendance unveiled it Wednesday night on the Australian television network. A Clinton spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It’s been reported that Clinton missed a potential opportunity to kill Bin Laden during his presidency. The 9/11 Commission Report found that administration officials decided against a strike in Afghanistan in late 1998 that could have taken out the Al Qaeda leader in Kandahar, which is actually a city of more than 400,000. The U.S. had tried to wipe out Bin Laden in August 1998 with a missile strike that hit a terror camp in Afghanistan. Bin Laden was killed in May 2011 during the Obama administration in a U.S. raid on his Pakistan hideout. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Reading is one of the most important keys for language development. Reading out loud teaches children what words are supposed to sound like: it teaches them to connect sounds with letters. The more words a baby hears, for example, the broader their vocabulary at age 3. Yes, you can simply talk to your infant to boost how many words they hear, but reading gives you words so that you don't have to think of things to say, and it teaches the baby new words. When you read to your child one-on-one, it adds to their perception of reading as a positive, nurturing activity. Not only that, it has been proven that reading out loud helps children cope with trauma. Reading out loud helps children return to reading later in life, both because it reminds them of happy times with parents and because it helped them through a hard time. Difficulty reading leads to failure in school, which of course leads to problems later in life. Exposing children to reading even before they can read exposes them to words and experiences they would have never received in daily life, which lays the foundation for them to be familiar with concepts they will later learn in school. Failure in school leads to social problems like delinquency, teen pregnancy, and substance abuse. Reading out loud familiarizes children with experiences they would not otherwise be exposed to, giving them knowledge before they ever enter school. It also teaches them to have a bigger vocabulary, which can help them get further in life. For example, teachers tend to pay attention to kids who have better reading comprehension than the rest of class, and often provide them with access to books at higher levels of reading, giving a child more knowledge than other students. Reading to a child provides you with an opportunity for a child to look up to you because when you are excited about reading, a child will be too. You set the example for your child to become a reader, and when they engage with reading over time, they turn to you for help. Reading out loud provides children with a world they can imagine, even when the book already contains pictures. Books give children ideas, characters, and settings outside of their experience, which they often will explore when playing “pretend.” Summary:","completion":"Reading out loud is essential for language development in children. It teaches them to connect sounds with letters and helps broaden their vocabulary. Reading to infants and young children not only increases the number of words they hear but also presents new words and concepts, setting a strong foundation for their future education. Reading out loud creates a positive and nurturing environment that fosters a love for reading, which can help children cope with trauma and maintain good reading habits throughout their life. Difficulty in reading can lead to school failure and social problems, while a strong reading background provides better opportunities for success both in school and life. Teachers tend to pay more attention to students with better reading comprehension and provide them access to more advanced reading materials. Reading to your child sets an example for them to follow and encourages their love for reading, leading to a continuous engagement and learning process. Furthermore, reading out loud sparks children's imagination by exposing them to various characters, ideas, and settings outside of their daily experiences. This exposure helps them develop important cognitive and imaginative skills that they can utilize in various aspects of their life, such as playing \\"pretend\\" and understanding different perspectives. Overall, reading out loud to your child is not only an essential activity for language development, but it also provides invaluable benefits that can contribute to their lifelong success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who agree to share the cost of getting rod of Truck? ? Mack \\"Truck\\" Turner is a former professional football player who becomes a Los Angeles-based bounty hunter after an injury. Truck visits his girlfriend, Annie, who is in jail and wants to leave LA when released. Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty, a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda, who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes. A tip from Truck's friend Duke allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line. Dorinda offers Gator's competing pimps a deal: whoever kills Truck gets to replace Gator while she runs the stable. The only pimp interested in the violence is Harvard Blue. Truck survives several ambushes by Blue's goons. When Blue points out that Dorinda will not be able to deal with Truck, they agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck, and Blue will take over more control of Gator's stable. Blue's men force Nate to call Truck and tell him that there is a big job. Truck does not feel sober enough after a night of partying, so he calls Jerry, who dies in Blue's ambush. Nate warns Truck of the hit out on him. Truck frames Annie for shoplifting, and the police arrest her. Truck visits Nate again in the hospital. Truck gives Nate Jerry's gun for protection, and then they shoot Blue's goons when they burst in. Blue flees, but Truck shoots him. Blue dies a few minutes later in the driver's seat of his car. Truck confronts Dorinda and more goons at her house, and kills her when she reaches for a gun. The answer is:","completion":"Dorinda and Harvard Blue are the full names of the people who agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I once did a year of voluntary service in a residential home for people with learning disabilities. was set in an English village deep in the countryside, quite different from my home in Sweden. One of my fellow volunteers, a girl from Tanzania, seemed a little unhappy, so I asked what the problem was. She told me she had a friend back home who had financial difficulties and maybe it was impossible for her to complete her university courses. So this friend of mine had sent all her money to Tanzania to support her friend! This meant that she didn't have much food to eat and no money to go anywhere outside the village. I was so touched and I felt I had to do something. So, during my next trip to one of the nearby towns I walked into a shop. I didn't have much money left myself but I thought I'd buy her an extra box of chocolate we both liked and some rice. I started talking to the woman(also a volunteer)working in the shop and eventually told her about my friend. The woman looked at me, amazed. \\"Does she eat pasta?\\" she asked. \\"Yes,\\" I replied. She immediately started loading a bag with pasta, cookies, and other things until the bag was full. \\"Give her this for me. It's my treat!'' I couldn't believe it but accepted with happiness. As I left the shop to go home with my unexpected bag of food, I asked the woman her name. \\"Just Gloria,\\" she said. Imagine my friend's face when I arranged the gifts on my kitchen table and fetched her from her room to see! I had never seen her so happy!

The incident occurred about 10:25 a.m. when firefighters responded to a report of a bee sting in the 23000 block of Buckland Lane, the Orange County Fire Authority tweeted. The woman was basically covered with bees from head to toe when officials arrived, said Ryan Wilson, one of the four firefighters credited with saving her life. “As we approached her — I got maybe 15, 20 feet from her — and I could see clumps of bees all over her body,” Wilson told KTLA. Several hundred were on her face alone, “in her hair, just kind of intertwined and kind of engulfed her whole head,” Wilson said. “They were in sheets, kind of, attached to her all over — in her ear, her neck.” The swarm was so severe that firefighters didn't have time to put the special safety gear on that they would normally wear while responding to such incidents, according to Fire Authority Capt. Tony Bommarito. “They got out, they started felling the bees, they saw the patient down this cul-de-sac completely covered — her face was completely covered with bees,\\" he said. They grabbed an extinguisher in an effort to remove the bulk of the bees off of the victim, then “basically dragged” her to a safe area about 200 yards away. “She was kind of just struck over with fear, and I kept grabbing her, telling her, ‘Let’s go,’ and she had bees all over her arms,\\" Wilson said. \\"So we made the decision just to grab her, and take off and get out of the area, because we didn’t know where the bees were coming from.” The woman, a 48-year-old housekeeper named Maria, had gone out to a vehicle to grab cleaning supplies when she was attacked, according to the homeowner. The victim was stung at least 200 times, fire officials said, and she was taken to a hospital in critical condition. A beekeeper who removed the hive estimated there were between 60,000 and 80,000 bees. The woman was intubated an the intensive care unit Monday night, her family told firefighters, but was expected to recover and be released within the next few days. The firefighters were also stung “multiple times” and taken to a hospital in stable condition, but returned to work later Monday afternoon.

Write some highlights for the following article: British Airways cabin crew members went on strike Saturday, leaving thousands of would-be passengers' travel plans during the next two weeks in disarray. The strike came after British Airways Chief Executive Willie Walsh and the joint general secretary of the Unite union, Tony Woodley, emerged Friday from a meeting and announced the effort to avert the walkout had failed. \\"This company does not want to negotiate,\\" Woodley said of British Airways. \\"This company wants ultimately to go to war with my members and the union.\\" Walsh said he \\"deeply regrets\\" the inconvenience the strikes will cause to passengers but said the company will still try to operate as many flights as possible. \\"I am disappointed the union has not been able to see the sense of the proposal we tabled today,\\" Walsh said. Advice for passengers. British Airways posted lists on its Web site of flights that it plans to operate during the walkout. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he \\"believes that this strike is in no one's interest and will cause unacceptable inconvenience to passengers. He urges the strike be called off immediately\\" and the two sides return to bargaining. In addition to the three-day strike beginning Saturday, Unite has decided to strike for four more days beginning March 27. Unite represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew members, but not all of them plan to strike. The airline has unveiled an ambitious contingency plan to get as many passengers as possible to their destinations. Walsh said he hopes that by leasing aircraft and using replacement workers, BA will be able to deliver about two-thirds of its customers to their planned destinations during the strikes. In a full-page ad in British newspapers Friday, Walsh said a \\"significant number\\" of cabin crews don't support the strike and will continue to work, supported by volunteers from across the airline. The airline said it has also made agreements with more than 60 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge if their British Airways flights are canceled during the strike period. Will a strike by British Airways affect you? But in a posting on its Web site, Unite called the schedule \\"an accomplished work of fantasy.\\" The industrial action is over planned changes to the way cabin crews operate, which British Airways says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds (90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew staffing levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. \\"Unite believes the new contractual changes are an attempt to force staff to pay the price for management failings with the company wringing more and more out of fewer and fewer staff who will be paid less,\\" the union said in a posting on its Web site. A cabin crew member's starting salary is 11,000 pounds (16,500), Unite said. Unite said that BA management submitted a formal offer to the union last week, but the offer failed to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. That prompted Unite officials to announce the strike dates. BA then rescinded its offer. British Airways submitted a new offer Friday, but Woodley said it reduced the amount of pay that had been in last week's offer. iReport: Are you caught up in the strike? A sticking point in negotiations was reportedly how BA could be compensated for the 27 million pound (40.5 million) loss it had already incurred through canceled tickets before the talks broke down. Walsh said he told Unite that the expense must be recovered, so the financial value of Friday's offer was \\"not as attractive\\" as last week's. The new offer, however, would have secured long-term pay protection for all existing crew, \\"new opportunities\\" for BA crew at London's Gatwick airport, and modernization of its industrial relations, he said. Any BA workers who go on strike now risk losing permanently their travel perks, such as free and heavily discounted travel. \\"We said to them that we will not continue to provide valuable perks and benefits to people who seek to inflict serious and ongoing damage to our business,\\" Walsh said. \\"It wasn't a threat. When we said that those traveling concessions will be withdrawn, that's exactly what we meant, and that's exactly what will happen.\\" Should BA staff lose travel perks? Unite said BA cabin crews offered changes to pay and work practices that would have saved the company more than 100 million pounds (150 million), but that their offer was rejected. The airline's management said the proposed changes would have saved the airline less money than management's planned changes. CNN's Richard Quest contributed to this report.

In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike.

Paragraph : Temperature affects the rate at which photosynthesis, cellular respiration and decomposition take place. The rate of reaction increases with increasing temperature and decreases at lower temperatures. Question: john was watching the rate of reactions going on in some plants. he noticed that the rate increased when the temperatures increased or decreased? Answer:","completion":"John was observing the rate of reactions going on in some plants and he noticed that the rate increased when the temperatures increased. The paragraph states that temperature affects the rate at which photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and decomposition take place. The rate of reaction increases with increasing temperature and decreases at lower temperatures. This increase in reaction rate with temperature is explained by the collision theory and the concept of activation energy. Higher temperatures provide more energy to the molecules involved in the reactions, causing them to move faster and collide more frequently. This results in an increased likelihood of successful collisions and the formation of new product molecules, thus accelerating the rate of reaction. In the context of plants, an increased temperature boosts the rate of photosynthesis, which is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This is a vital process for plant growth and development. Cellular respiration, another key process in plants, involves breaking down glucose molecules to produce energy needed for various cellular activities and functions. Both of these processes are temperature-sensitive and follow the same trend of increased reaction rates with higher temperatures. However, it is important to note that this relationship between temperature and reaction rate is not linear, and there is an optimum temperature for these biological processes, beyond which reaction rates begin to drop. This drop occurs because high temperatures can cause enzymes, the biological catalysts responsible for facilitating these reactions, to denature or lose their structural integrity. Once an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer fulfill its function, and the overall rate of reaction declines. In summary, John observed that the rate of reactions in plants increased when temperatures increased, which is consistent with the information provided in the paragraph. As temperature rises, the rate of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and decomposition processes increase, promoting more efficient growth and energy production in plants. However, it is crucial to consider the limitations of these temperature-sensitive processes, as too high temperatures can have detrimental effects on the enzymes and overall reaction rates."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: A street sign is shown Monday, Nov. 7, 2011, in Bellevue, Wash., near the stretch where a woman told investigators her 2-year-old son disappeared after she left him alone in her car Sunday after it ran... (Associated Press) A street sign is shown Monday, Nov. 7, 2011, in Bellevue, Wash., near the stretch where a woman told investigators her 2-year-old son disappeared after she left him alone in her car Sunday after it ran... (Associated Press) Police searching for a 2-year-old Washington state boy focused their efforts Monday around the home of his mother, who reportedly told investigators she last saw him in her stalled car on a city street as she walked away for an hour to get gas. It wouldn't be the first time Sky Metalwala had been left alone in a car. When he was just 3 months old, court records revealed, his parents left him in their sport utility vehicle in a Target parking lot for 55 minutes on a 27-degree day. They only came out of the store to get him after police arrived and asked for the vehicle's owner to be paged. The toddler's disappearance Sunday in Bellevue, a city of 122,000 across Lake Washington from Seattle, came at the height of a custody fight between his parents, Julia Biryukova and Solomon Metalwala. They separated in March 2010 amid back-and-forth protective orders and allegations of abuse and psychiatric problems. Last December, a social worker determined that there was a \\"preponderance of evidence\\" that Metalwala had struck his daughter hard enough to cause bruising, court records show. The social worker also said Sky had troubling bruises, but because the boy could not talk, it wasn't clear where he got them. However the attorney for Metalwala, Leslie Clay Terry III, said Monday that case worker had only interviewed the mother and that Child Protective Services later conducted an investigation that cleared Metalwala. \\"He was exonerated completely,\\" Terry said. Last week, at a mandatory mediation session, a tentative agreement was hammered out that would allow Metalwala to have some visitation with Sky and his older sister, his lawyer said. Biryukova reported that her car ran out of gas in Bellevue on Sunday morning, police said. She said she left Sky in the unlocked vehicle and walked with her daughter, who is 4, about a mile to a gas station. When she returned to the car, Sky wasn't there, she said. Investigators searched a 20-block area and even went door to door but found no sign of him. There was no gas can at the car, police said. The Bellevue Police Department said both parents were cooperating, and Biryukova had consented to have her vehicle and home in nearby Redmond searched. The older child has been placed in protective custody. \\"We're looking at it from all angles, at this point,\\" said Bellevue Police Maj. Mike Johnson. \\"Missing person, abduction, foul play has not been ruled out.\\" Biryukova did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Her younger brother, Stanley Biryukov, said Julia was crying frantically when she called him Sunday afternoon and explained what had happened. \\"I'm hoping they'll find the child,\\" he said. Metalwala spoke with reporters at the office of his lawyer, Terry. They said his estranged wife's story was bizarre: Why didn't she call for help, knock on a nearby door, or take the child with her? \\"I don't understand why she would leave a little baby in the car,\\" Metalwala said. \\"The whole story is puzzling.\\" Several TV stations reported that Metalwala took a polygraph test Monday evening. His lawyer, Terry, told KING-TV the results were \\"inconclusive right now.\\" He said his client was too tired to give an accurate result and would take another test later. Terry did not immediately return an Associated Press call. In December 2009, Redmond police cited both parents for reckless endangerment at the Target parking lot. A shopper who heard the baby crying in the SUV called police, and a responding officer reported that the car felt cold. Paged inside the store, the couple said they had left the baby in the car for 15 to 20 minutes because they didn't want to wake him up. Surveillance video of the parking lot later proved it had actually been 55 minutes. The case was dismissed early this year after the pair completed a year of probation, 40 hours of community service and a 10-week parenting class. The couple had been together for 14 years. He was 21 and she was a high school sophomore when they began dating, according to one of her court declarations. In another declaration, her mother, Nadia Biryukova, wrote that they married in 2003 in her kitchen just before he was to be deported to Pakistan. In court documents filed in connection with their divorce, Julia Biryukova said their relationship deteriorated in 2008 after they bought an expensive home in Kirkland and couldn't keep up with the payments on that property and a condominium they also owned. The couple separated in March 2010, court records show. In June 2010, the same month Metalwala filed for divorce, Biryukova, 30, filed for a protection order on behalf of herself and their two children. She said Metalwala, 36, had a severe anger problem, was verbally abusive and that he had beat her for the first time on Christmas Day, just weeks after the incident at the Target parking lot. The reason was that she had allowed Sky to sleep later than expected, she said. \\"He became furious like I have never seen him before, he grabbed me by my hair (in front of our 3 1/2 year old daughter), dragged me into our hallway, threw me down on the floor and then threw me against a decorative column we have in the entrance of our home,\\" Biryukova wrote. \\"He continued to assault me with his feet _ by kicking me and then he took out his car keys and continued to scratch me in any area he could.\\" The abuse escalated after that, with Solomon telling her to go live on the street and work as a prostitute, she said. \\"The most, most recent have been his threats to kill me if I say anything against him or if in any way I proceed with action of seeking custody of our two small children,\\" Biryukova added. \\"I live in constant fear for my life and my children's life. Please investigate and help me!\\" He responded that she had mental health problems and was involuntarily committed to a mental clinic in 2010. \\"The accusations against him were totally false,\\" his lawyer said. Earlier this year a social worker with state Child Protective Services reported that a doctor found her to be in good mental health and an appropriate caregiver for the children. One psychologist who evaluated Biryukova wrote in July 2010 that though she was dealing with \\"a severe form of obsessive compulsive disorder, I do not believe that interferes with her ability to be a compassionate, effective parent to her children.\\" CPS received six referrals about the family from late 2009 to late 2010, state officials reported in court documents. ___ Johnson and Le reported from Seattle. Associated Press writer Donna Gordon Blankinship contributed to this report. ||||| The father of missing 2-year-old Sky Metalwala was charged with leaving a child unattended in a motor vehicle in 2009, Redmond, Wash., prosecuting attorney Larry Mitchell told ABCNews.com today. The FBI has joined the search for the toddler who has been missing since Sunday morning after his mother, Julia Biryukova of Redmond, said she left him alone for an hour in an unlocked car in Bellevue, Wash. Biryukova told police she was driving with her two children when she ran out of gas on 112th Avenue, a two way street that borders Interstate 520. So she and her 4-year-old trekked about a mile to a nearby gas station, Northtowne Chevron Service, leaving Sky in the car, she said. Police said she then called a friend who dropped her off at her car about an hour later. But when they returned to the 2-door silver Acura, Biryukova said, the boy was gone. There was no sign of forced entry, according to police, who stopped searching the wooded area near the car Sunday. A gas can wasn't found in Biryukova's car, a detail that \\"could mean a lot of things,\\" Bellevue police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told ABCNews.com. They are now searching the area near Biryukova's home. \\"Currently, we're searching in the area around the mother's apartment. Since the last time she saw the child was in her car and [prior to that she] was in her apartment,\\" Iafrate said. Police said family member have been cooperating with investigators. Prior Charge for Sky Metalwala's Father Solomon Metalwala, a Kirkland, Wash., resident, pleaded guilty to leaving a child unattended in 2010 after a December 2009 incident in which Sky, who was 3 months old at the time, was discovered sitting alone in the couple's car in a Target parking lot. \\"A citizen noticed and had called the police,\\" prosecutor Mitchell said. \\"They eventually made contact with the mother and father who were in the store shopping. There was some discussion about leaving the child unattended.\\" Solomon Metalwala paid a fine, did 40 hours of community service and completed a parenting class, so the case was dismissed in February of this year. The child's uncle, Sam Metalwala, told ABC affiliate KOMO-TV in Seattle the boy's parents are going through a divorce after being married for seven years. And for now, all the family can do is hope for a new lead. \\"They just told us to wait by the phone, so we're just waiting by the phone to see,\\" he said. Solomon Metalwala could not be reached for comment. According to The Associated Press, the couple had been together for 14 years. They married in 2003 and separated in 2010, the same year Biryukova, 30, filed for an order of protection for herself and her children, the AP reported. She claimed Metalwala, 36, had become abusive. \\"He became furious like I have never seen him before, he grabbed me by my hair (in front of our 3 1/2 year old daughter), dragged me into our hallway, threw me down on the floor and then threw me against a decorative column we have in the entrance of our home,\\" Biryukova wrote in court documents obtained by the AP. \\"He continued to assault me with his feet -- by kicking me and then he took out his car keys and continued to scratch me in any area he could.\\" According to the AP, Metalwala claimed she had mental health issues and he didn't trust her to care for the children. Searching for Sky Metalwala Sky is half Indian and half Caucasian, with brown eyes and dark buzz-cut hair. He was last seen wearing a dark green hooded sweatshirt with blue and gray striped Carter's pants, the same outfit he's pictured in above. Anyone who sees a child matching this description is asked to call 911 immediately. Police are urging anyone who might have traveled along 112th Ave N.E., between I-520 and NE 24th Ave N.E., Sunday morning between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. is to call Bellevue, Wash., police.

It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the records of 1814.

Peebles Corp. proposed a 330 million complex of residences, hotel rooms, and retailers. As a development site, the state-owned property at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Boylston Street has its problems. The land is hemmed in by an MBTA station and divided by the open scar of the Massachusetts Turnpike. But that hasn’t stopped developers from dreaming big. Three companies on Friday submitted proposals to build large complexes on the 50,000-square-foot lot, across from the Hynes Convention Center. The pitches include a curvy, 11-story building with residences, a hotel, and stores, as well as a 21-story complex with shops and 350 apartments. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation will select a winner in the coming months. The redevelopment would create a new entrance to the Back Bay and help enliven a disjointed section of the otherwise bustling neighborhood. The winning bidder will also be required to overhaul the MBTA’s Hynes Convention Center stop on the Green Line. Transportation officials want to relocate the entrances to the station, modernize its layout and architecture, and add elevators and new turnstiles, among other improvements. The state’s property, known as Parcel 13, is one of several air rights parcels slated for redevelopment in the Back Bay. Developers Adam Weiner and Steve Samuels are planning to transform nearby lots into a 32-story hotel, residences, and retail stores in coming years. But don’t expect construction to start right away. Air rights parcels are particularly difficult to develop in Boston, facing many bureaucratic hurdles and financial challenges due to the added cost of building over an active highway. The bidders for Parcel 13 include Boston Residential Group, Trinity Financial LLC, and the Peebles Corp., a minority-owned firm from Florida looking to break into Boston’s red-hot real estate market. ■ Peebles proposed a curvy, 330 million complex that would include 181 residences, a 156-room hotel, and 20,000 square feet of retail space. The complex, designed by Handel Architects of New York, would rise to 11 stories and contain 138 parking spaces as well as 6,800 square feet of community space. It would be called Viola Back Bay, a homage to the adjacent Berklee College of Music. “We want the building to be very contextual, but you will know it’s a new building,” said R. Donahue “Don” Peebles, the company’s chief executive. “The architecture of the building is significant, so a viewer will recognize and appreciate that.” Peebles has developed large projects nationwide, including the Royal Palm Hotel in Miami Beach and 10 G Street, a 280,000-square-foot office building near Union Station in Washington, D.C. ■ Trinity Financial of Boston proposed a multitiered building that would rise to 21 stories along Boylston Street. The 223 million development would include 350 apartments, retail space, and about 100 parking spaces. Trinity has partnered with the transportation department on other major projects near transit stations. It developed the 241-unit Avenir housing complex at North Station and is now building One Canal, a 350-unit residential project on adjacent property. It also built a housing complex above Ashmont Station in Dorchester. “We really feel like we’ve assembled the team that can pull this off,” said Kenan Bigby, a vice president at Trinity. “We see this as filling in a missing tooth in what is a very active and vibrant neighborhood.” ■ Boston Residential Group also submitted a proposal for the property, according to state officials, but executives with the company could not be reached for comment on their plans Friday.

Book Review - 'Willie Mays - The Life, the Legend,' by James S. Hirsch - Review - NYTimes.com A long time ago in America, there was a beautiful game called baseball. This was before 30 major-league teams were scattered in a blurry variety of divisions; before 162-game seasons and extended playoffs and fans who watched World Series games in thick down jackets; before the D.H. came to the American League; before AstroTurf on baseball fields and aluminum bats on sandlots; before complete games by pitchers were a rarity; before ballparks were named for corporations instead of individuals; and long, long before the innocence of the game was permanently stained by the filthy deception of steroids. Illustration by Rodrigo Corral; photograph from Bettmann/Corbis In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player In that vanished time, there was a ballplayer named Willie Mays. He came to a Manhattan ballpark named the Polo Grounds in 1951, when he was 20, to play for the New York Giants. Within a few months, he showed that he had the potential to become one of the greatest players ever to walk on the green grass of the major leagues. He could hit, he could run, he could catch, he could throw. And he brought to the playing of baseball a mysterious, almost magical quality that has disappeared from the professional game. Willie Mays brought us joy. All of us. Even those of us who from birth were fanatical acolytes of the secular church of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The ­Dodgers were in my DNA. My father was an immigrant from Belfast and didn’t become truly American until he got baseball. I’m sure that passionate embrace was true of millions of other immigrants, and was swiftly passed to their American children. My father took me to my first ballgame at Ebbets Field in 1946. I went with my own friends one June day in 1947, just before my 12th birthday, and saw Jackie Robinson in his first brave season, saw him get hit by a pitch, then steal second, then drive the pitcher nuts with his jittery feints, and then score on a single. And heard the gigantic roar from all the Brooklyn tribes. Bed-Stuy was joined at last with Bensonhurst and Park Slope, Flatbush and Bay Ridge. For Robinson and the team president, Branch Rickey, had done more than simply integrate baseball. They had integrated the stands. From the box seats to the bleachers, we were consumed by love of the Dodgers. The phrase “Dem Bums” was uttered with deep affection. All those old passions rose in me again when reading James S. Hirsch’s fine new book, “Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend.” Above all, I remembered Mays getting a thunderous round of applause when he first came to bat in games at Ebbets Field (the only other visiting player to hear such cheers was Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals). Even the most fanatical Dodger fans wanted Mays to go 3 for 4, steal two bases and make one astounding catch in center field, as long as the Dodgers won, 6-4. Here I must plead guilty to nostalgia, but not to sentimentality, which is always a lie about the past. Like millions of others, I was there. And I remember the joy of watching a young man named Mays play the game for everything it was worth. To all of us then, it was worth a lot. “By the time he retired,” Hirsch writes, “he was an American icon whose athletic brilliance and stylistic bravado contributed to the assimilation of blacks during the turbulent civil rights era, a distinctive figure of ambition, sacrifice and triumph who became a lasting cultural touchstone for a nation in search of heroes.” In his long, fascinating account, Hirsch tells the full story of Mays’s baseball life. He was born in 1931 in a mainly black mill town outside Birmingham, Ala., where he was raised by his father, Willie Mays Sr. (known as Cat), and his mother’s two younger sisters. His mother, Annie Satterwhite, never married his father, but the strapped Depression household was full of feminine warmth. Beyond that small community, the world could be ominous with danger. In Alabama, there were still living Americans who had been born into slavery. The Ku Klux Klan, the most enduring of American terrorist organizations, remained the ultimate enforcer of the iron rules of segregation. When Willie was 7, the family moved to Fairfield, a nearby town that was biracial. By then, the boy had discovered baseball, and he was tutored by Cat, who played semipro ball. Young Willie learned to hit and run and slide and catch and throw. The full curriculum. Most important, he learned the rules of the game. They were at once a challenge and a comfort. “Willie Mays,” Hirsch writes, “always recalled his childhood as a joyous, sunlit time surrounded by loving friends and family who encouraged his dreams and sheltered him from hardship.” In great detail, Hirsch — the author of “Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter” — tells the story of the rise of the teenage Mays, who first starred in high school sports (including basketball and football) and then, even before graduation, joined the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro leagues. Older players guided him in baseball and in life. In 1950, he was signed by the New York Giants for 4,000 and assigned to a minor-league team in Trenton; in 1951, he moved to the triple-A Minneapolis Millers. He was hitting .477 in the first 35 games when the Giants called him up. The Giants’ owner, Horace Stoneham, assigned a boxing promoter named Frank Forbes as the kid’s personal guardian, charged with warding off all temptation and finding him a place to live in Harlem. But his baseball guardian was the Giants’ manager, Leo Durocher. Hirsch gives us a delightfully raffish portrait of the man Mays would call Mr. Leo for all the years to come. Mr. Leo’s desire to win, at all costs. His baseball intelligence. And his marvelous gift for obscenity (the one Durocher characteristic Mays did not adopt). With his nerves pulsing steadily, Mays started off poorly, going 1 for 26 (the one hit was a home run off the great Warren Spahn). Then he started to hit, and the career had begun. That rookie year, he was in the on-deck circle during the playoff game with the Dodgers, trembling with stress, when Bobby Thomson hit “the shot heard round the world.” Before he was done, Mays would hit 660 home runs of his own. Pete Hamill, the author of more than 20 books, is a distinguished writer in residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"In \\"Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend,\\" author James S. Hirsch offers a fascinating account of the baseball legend Willie Mays, detailing his childhood, rise to fame, and the impact he had on the game. The book presents Mays as a cultural touchstone and an American icon who, through his athletic prowess and charisma, helped integrate black players into the world of professional baseball during the civil rights era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: A woman has been put into isolation at Northampton General Hospital with a suspected case of Ebola, it has emerged. The hospital released few details about the patient last night but it is believed she had recently travelled abroad. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'I can confirm that we have a suspected case of Ebola. It is a female adult. She will be in isolation if she is suspected of having the illness.' Scroll down for video. The woman has been placed in an isolation unit at Northampton General Hospital (pictured) with what is suspected to be Ebola. The hospital spokesman said she was unable to provide further details about the identity of the woman or how she may have contracted the illness. It comes just two days after it was revealed the condition of Pauline Cafferkey had improved - the 39-year-old nurse was struck down by the virus after returning from Sierra Leone in west Africa. In recent months Northampton General Hospital has attempted to reassure the public it has plans in place to manage cases of Ebola in the event of an outbreak. A spokesman said: 'We have robust systems and processes which will ensure we are able to identify and isolate a patient who presents with symptoms of Ebola or any other infectious disease. 'We have sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, and access to expert testing and advice. Pauline Cafferkey (pictured) was a volunteer with Save the Children in Sierra Leone but only became ill with Ebola after having returned to Britain. 'We would like to reassure local people that the risk of infection in the UK remains very low. 'Nevertheless we are being extremely vigilant and taking all appropriate measures to ensure we are fully prepared. Our plans are being kept under continuous review and amended as the situation changes.' Miss Cafferkey had been a volunteer with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town but only became ill when she returned to Britain just after Christmas. After taking an experimental anti-viral drug and receiving blood plasma transfusions from a European Ebola survivor at the Royal Free Hospital in north London, her condition improved. A hospital spokesman said Monday: 'The Royal Free Hospital is pleased to announce that Pauline Cafferkey is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill. 'She remains in isolation as she receives specialist care for the Ebola virus.' David Cameron welcomed the news during Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons. He said he was sure everybody was thinking of her, adding: 'It is very good news that she is out of critical care, but there is still a long way to go.' He was responding to Conservative Nicola Blackwood, who said: 'I'm sure the whole House will want to honour the bravery of NHS Ebola volunteers and welcome the news that nurse Pauline Cafferkey is off the critical list.' She also raised the work going on in Oxford to develop a vaccine, which the Tory leader called 'vitally important'. He added: 'The minister for government policy is leading the work on this and making sure we do everything to try and cut through some of the bureaucracy that otherwise would be in place so that we can develop a vaccine fast.' There are currently no specific drugs to cure Ebola, nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease. Two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the UK, US, Mali and Uganda. Experts expect to see the first results of those trials early next year. The Royal Free Hospital is the only High Level Isolation Unit in the UK to house two high-security containment beds. They are located inside isolation 'bubbles' - specially-designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection. Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola. There are around 50 other designated Ebola beds at these three centres. Around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants. The process could yield 20 to 40 doses a month. Evidence suggests that effective treatment with ZMapp requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. It is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies, which can prove effective in fighting the disease. The nurse, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, had volunteered with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, before returning to the UK. Save the Children has launched an investigation into how she was infected, but admits it may never establish the exact circumstances. She flew back to the UK via Casablanca in Morocco. Her temperature was tested seven times before she flew from Heathrow to Glasgow and she was cleared to travel. She later became feverish and followed advice given to her at Heathrow to contact local services and was admitted to an isolation facility at the Brownlee unit in Gartnavel Hospital, Glasgow, at 8am on December 29. After a blood sample tested positive for Ebola, she was transferred in a military plane to the Royal Free Hospital by 8am on December 30.","completion":"A woman has been placed in isolation at Northampton General Hospital with a suspected case of Ebola.

George Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878 - November 5, 1942), known professionally as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Cohan appeared in 1930 in a revival of his tribute to vaudeville and his father, The Song and Dance Man. In 1932, Cohan starred in a dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New York City. A critic called Gambling a \\"stodgy adaptation of a definitely dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique.\\" It is considered a lost film. Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's only comedy, Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play called Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast. In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 musical Little Nellie Kelly. Cohan's mystery play Seven Keys to Baldpate was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently as House of Long Shadows (1983), starring Vincent Price. In 1942, a musical biopic of Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of abdominal cancer; Cohan's comment on Cagney's performance was, \\"My God, what an act to follow!\\" Cohan's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.

Build a movie plot around this: Who escapes through the septic tank into the ruins of the city? Eva.","completion":"Title: The Ruins of Hope Step 1: Establish the setting The movie takes place in a dystopian future where a totalitarian regime led by General Morgan controls the city and its inhabitants. The city is in ruins, with only a few privileged people living in a high-security zone and the rest struggling to survive in the harsh environment. Step 2: Introduce the protagonist Eva is a smart, resourceful, and courageous woman in her late 20s. She has lived a harsh life under the regime and has seen her family and friends disappear or succumb to the conditions. She becomes involved with a rebellious group called \\"The Resistance\\" that fights against General Morgan and his oppressive government. Step 3: Present the problem Eva is captured by the regime's forces during a failed attack on General Morgan's headquarters. She is taken to a high-security prison where she is tortured and interrogated. Additionally, her life partner, Alex, is also taken captive, and they are separately detained in different prison wings. Step 4: Introduce the primary focus Eva overhears a guard mentioning that her section of the prison facility is connected to an old sewer system and an abandoned septic tank. Realizing that this might be her only chance of escape, she becomes determined to break free and find Alex. Along the way, she will discover the weaknesses within the regime's structure that could help bring it down. Step 5: Show progress and setbacks Eva befriends a fellow prisoner, Mark, a former engineer who knows the layout of the sewer system and the septic tank's location. They work together to formulate an escape plan by secretly gathering necessary tools and materials. However, their plan is nearly exposed when a snooping guard becomes suspicious of their activities. With Mark taking the heat and providing a diversion, Eva manages to slip away unnoticed and venture into the dark and hazardous sewer and septic tank. Step 6: The climax Guided by Mark's detailed instructions, Eva overcomes various obstacles and dangers as she navigates the crumbling sewer system. Finally, she reaches the septic tank and breaks through its rusted cover to find herself in the ruined city outside the high-security zone. Step 7: The resolution Eva rejoins The Resistance, sharing her knowledge of the prison's weak points and the regime's vulnerabilities. Alongside her fellow rebels, she leads a daring rescue mission to free Alex and the other prisoners, including Mark. Together, they cause a massive uprising, and the regime begins to crumble. In the end, Eva and Alex reunite, and the movie concludes with the promise of a brighter future as The Resistance starts rebuilding the city and establishing a new, fairer government. Justification: The plot revolves around Eva's bravery, resourcefulness, and determination to escape the high-security prison and rescue her loved ones. By involving the septic tank as an integral part of her journey, we underpin the grim and harsh reality—showing how far Eva is willing to go for freedom.

In Sentence (1), the phrasing \\"on board the 'Augusta Jessie'\\" is used, which refers to living on or inside the vessel. \\"On board\\" can be used to convey the idea of being aboard a ship, boat, train, or plane. It is often utilized to imply that the person(s) is a passenger or crew member of the vessel.

The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.

Two game companies, Antenna Research and Cortical Systematics, compete against each other. In addition, a group of \\"realists\\" fights both companies to prevent the \\"deforming\\" of reality. Antenna Research's Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the world's preeminent game designer, is testing her latest virtual reality game, eXistenZ, with a focus group at a seminar. She is shot in the shoulder by an assassin named Noel Dichter (Kris Lemche) with an organic pistol, which is undetectable by security. As Dichter is gunned down by the security team, security guard (and marketing trainee) Ted Pikul (Jude Law) rushes to Geller and escorts her outside. Allegra discovers that her pod, which contains the only copy of the eXistenZ game, may have been damaged due to an \\"UmbyCord\\" being ripped out as the game was being downloaded. To test it, she must plug into the game in tandem with another player she can trust, and talks a reluctant Pikul into installing a bio-port in his own body so he can play the game with her. Pikul, one of a dwindling few who has refused to have a bio-port installed to this point, at first objects due to a phobia about \\"surgical penetration\\", but eventually gives in. They head to a gas station run by a black-marketeer named Gas (Willem Dafoe) to get it installed. Gas deliberately installs a faulty bio-port and the game pod is damaged. Gas (a shotgun in hand) reveals that he is going to kill Allegra for the bounty on her head, but Pikul shoots him with the rivet gun used to install the port. The pair make their way to a former ski lodge used by Allegra's mentor, Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm). He and his assistant repair the damaged pod and give Pikul a new bio-port.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: Because action potentials are so brief, a neuron can produce hundreds per what? A: The answer is:","completion":"Because action potentials are so brief, a neuron can produce hundreds per second. Action potentials, also known as nerve impulses or spikes, are the electrical signals neurons use to transmit information. They are essential for proper neuronal communication and play a vital role in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. An action potential is a brief but rapid change in the electrical potential across the cell membrane of a neuron, which allows the neuron to generate a signal that propagates along its axon towards other neurons or target cells. The duration of an action potential typically lasts between 1-2 milliseconds; however, the exact duration may vary depending on the type of neuron and the specific conditions. Given this short time frame, neurons are capable of rapidly producing and transmitting multiple action potentials in a short period. As a result, a neuron can generate and send hundreds of action potentials per second, enabling efficient and fast communication between cells within the nervous system. This high frequency of action potential generation is vital for various physiological functions and responses to external stimuli. Some examples include processing sensory information, producing coordinated muscle movements, maintaining homeostasis, and supporting higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. The ability of neurons to produce hundreds of action potentials per second is facilitated by the refractory period – a brief interval of time, typically lasting around a few milliseconds, during which a neuron cannot generate another action potential. This refractory period serves as a timing mechanism that prevents continuous firing of action potentials and ensures proper neuronal communication. In conclusion, the brief nature of action potentials allows neurons to generate and transmit numerous electrical signals in a short period, with the capability of producing hundreds of these signals per second. This capacity for rapid action potential generation plays a critical role in the efficient communication and overall functionality of the nervous system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\\" the president wrote on Twitter. Story Continued Below Kim on Tuesday said he wants to hold off on firing missiles to \\"watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees,\\" according to reports of his interview with the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Over the past couple of weeks, tensions between North Korea and the United States have intensified. On Monday, Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that it would be \\"game on\\" if North Korea fired on a U.S. territory. Trump has in the past also said that North Korea \\"will be met with fire and fury\\" if it continues its threats. ||||| The war of words over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program has been as dramatic as it has been concerning. Kim Jong Un’s regime has said the entire United States is in its sights. Not to be outdone, President Donald Trump has promised “fire and fury” in a departure from the more measured tones of previous U.S. presidents. The increasing pattern of threat and counter-threat has led some to worry about potential miscommunication or miscalculation that could lead to armed conflict.

There’s the possibility that a missile could fall into offshore territory or onto our land itself.\\" But the heated language has generally met with a cooler response on the streets of cities and towns across the Asia-Pacific region. That’s despite people there potentially being in the firing line should the rhetoric escalate to military action. South Korea “It doesn't impact our everyday life and things that happen on a daily basis,” said 31-year-old Paul Rader, a teacher in Seoul’s international school. “The kind of tension around in the city among people is nonexistent here,\\" Rader adds. “Those of us who've been here for a long time, we tend to think it's saber rattling.” Not everyone in South Korea is so laid back, however. Thousands took to the streets of Seoul Tuesday to protest against joint U.S. and South Korean military drills and the deployment of the THAAD missile system in the country. South Korean protesters shout slogans during an anti-U.S. rally demanding peace on the Korean Peninsula in Seoul on Tuesday. Jung Yeon-Je / AFP - Getty Images Seoul is situated just 35 miles from the border with North Korea, well within range of its neighbor’s artillery. More than 23,000 U.S. troops are also stationed in South Korea. While most experts agree the U.S. and its allies would likely win any war with North Korea, doing so would almost certainly cost thousands of lives and cause huge destruction. However, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae In, said Tuesday that any \\"military action on the Korean peninsula can only be decided by South Korea and no one else.” Japan In Japan, the entirety of which is within the range of North Korea’s weapons, leading politicians have spoken of “a new level of threat” in recent weeks. Two North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) landed off the coast of Japan last month. Japan is also the only country to ever have nuclear weapons used upon on it, when the U.S. did so in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. On the streets of Tokyo, feeling was mixed over the level of threat currently posed. “What if North Korea misfires? There’s the possibility that a missile could fall into offshore territory or onto our land itself,\\" said one man who declined to give his name. \\"I’m a bit nervous.\\" Attendees hold doves, the symbol of peace, for releasing on Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan, during a commemoration of the country's WWII surrender. Taro Karibe / Getty Images However, another chimed in with: “I’m a little scared but the situation doesn’t really concern me.” American Michael Wright, who lives and works in Japan with his family. says he is unfazed by the situation and has no plans to leave. He said: \\"They’ve [Japan] have been under threat for a long time so it doesn’t matter. The Chinese are flying planes in here, you know, a thousand times, the Russians are flying in, so they’ve been under this mode for a long time,\\" he added. \\"I think there is heightened awareness. But like I said, they’ve been living this way for a while now.\\" Fellow U.S. citizen Karen Brady moved to Japan with her husband and one-year-old daughter. She too was unconcerned: \\"If the threat was for Japan, we wouldn’t have come,\\" she added. \\"I mean my concerns personally are if my daughter is having a good day at daycare and when the next earthquake’s going to be, because it kind of freaks me out.\\" China In the Chinese capital, Beijing, the threat of impending war was widely dismissed. China is North Korea’s primary ally and not a target for the Kim Jong Un regime. But President Donald Trump has looked to Beijing to rein in North Korea and its weapons program. “I don't think it's going to have an impact on my life at all,” said Xiaoxiao Zhan, a 25-year-old student at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Businesswoman Laura Wu, 52, said she was not nervous as there was no war. Even if there was, “the war will not be in China,” she added. Guam The U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, however, has been the subject of more specific threats of action. North Korea has said it was giving serious consideration to a plan to fire missiles at Guam. On Tuesday, two radio stations on the island accidentally played an emergency civil danger warning — the same warning that would sound in the event of an impending nuclear attack. Guam’s homeland security office later issued a statement on Facebook saying that they will work with radio stations to ensure such human error does not occur again. On one of Guam's many picturesque beaches Tuesday, however, one holidaying American was unconcerned about the threat of conflict. A woman poses for a friend under a sign reading \\"No drugs or nuclear weapons allowed\\" at the entrance to a restaurant in the Tamuning area of Guam. Ed Jones / AFP - Getty Images Eugene Gutierrez, a 59-year-old expat who has lived in Manila for 10 years told NBC News that he tended not to believe the “rhetoric and words” that have been prominent in news broadcasts recently. He added that he also trusted the U.S. government to “let us know” if there “things that are threatening to us.” Back in Seoul, Rader believes each side is aware that the cost of military action will be high meaning it’s unlikely North Korea will push the envelope too far. “If they preemptively strike … [it’s a] huge disaster for both sides, so I don't see what they gain from that,\\" he said. “I'm personally not afraid of what they might do because they would lose everything.” And if he’s wrong and the worst does happen? “We don't have a plan,” he says. “We're gonna hop on the moped and get out of the city I guess.” Eoghan Macguire reported from London, Shaquille Brewster reported from Guam, Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo and Paul Goldman reported from Seoul. ||||| People in Seoul are used to living with the North Korean threat, but many are worried they could pay the price if the verbal sparring match between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un leads to war. Protestors took to the streets of Seoul on Tuesday, demanding a peaceful solution to the North Korean conflict and calling on President Trump to tone down his rhetoric. Now, the U.S. and North Korea may be signalling that they want to talk more constructively, while China is telling the two countries to \\"hit the brakes\\" on threatening words and actions in a sign of growing concern over the standoff on the part of Pyongyang's only major ally. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, that the two countries should work together to contain tensions and permit no one to \\"stir up an incident on their doorstep,\\" according to a statement posted on the Chinese foreign ministry's website. \\"The most important task at hand is for the U.S. and North Korea to 'hit the brakes' on their mutual needling of each other with words and actions, to lower the temperature of the tense situation and prevent the emergence of an 'August crisis,'\\" Wang was quoted as saying in the Tuesday conversation. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the Trump administration was interested in opening a dialogue with North Korea, but that it was waiting for a signal of similar interest from Pyongyang. If North Korea were to end its seemingly endless barrage of missile tests, Washington said it would be willing to negotiate, especially after Kim Jong Un decided to hold off on launching missiles towards Guam. \\"We would like to have talks with him when the time is right,\\" State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert says. \\"When they show that they are serious, serious about an effort to move toward denuclearization, and we have not seen that yet.\\" All sides seemed to be acknowledging the obvious: A war on the Korean peninsula would be catastrophic, with South Korean President Moon Jae In saying he simply wouldn't allow it. The U.S. seemed to be backing down from its demand that North Korea abandon its weapons program entirely before talks could begin, saying instead that North Korea needed to freeze its weapons testing for a period of time. Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017 \\"There was some sort of method to recognize Kim Jong Un's security concerns and meet him halfway,\\" says John Delury, a professor of international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. \\"I don't think the kind of relationship the North Koreans want is screaming back and forth between them and the Americans, but they'll take that. They can do that. I think Kim Jong Un has more ambitions. I think things like a summit with Donald Trump and the selfie that the world is waiting for between these two extraordinary figures is the kind of thing they'd be interested in,\\" Delury continues. China and Russia floated a plan by which North Korea would freeze its missile tests if the United States and South Korea freezed their military exercises. However, the U.S. government said that option was a non-starter and planned to move ahead with joint exercises in South Korea next week. ||||| North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week stepped back from his threats to fire missiles toward the U.S. territory of Guam following a week of increasingly violent rhetoric between his isolated nation and President Trump. The dispute, which appeared to reach a head after more than a year of Kim accelerating his country’s nuclear and missile weapons programs, calls to mind the nuclear crisis between North Korea and the United States nearly 25 years ago during the Clinton administration. ADVERTISEMENT Former Defense Secretary William Perry has said the United States was on the brink of war with North Korea in the summer of 1994, when the Pentagon had tentative plans to send cruise missiles and stealth fighter jets to strike a small nuclear reactor within the country. The plan — meant to prevent North Korea from using raw material to make nuclear bombs — was rejected in favor of tougher United Nation sanctions. North Korea subsequently agreed to freeze its nuclear program. Experts on the volatile region said the similarities are apparent between the saber rattling now and then, but a more equipped North Korea is changing the approach to diplomacy with the country. Last week, North Korea threatened to launch ballistic missiles at waters off the coast of Guam, after Trump warned the nation it would “be met with fire and fury ... like the world has never seen,” if it continued to make threats against the U.S. and its allies. And on Monday, Defense Secretary James Mattis warned that a missile launched at the United States or its territories would be considered an act of war. “If they shoot at the United States, I’m assuming they hit the United States. If they do that, it’s game on,” Mattis told reporters. Lisa Collins, an expert on North Korea at the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the exchange of rhetoric between North Korea and the administration, though more heated, is not so different compared to 1994. “What’s different this time is North Korea’s development of its technology,” Collins told The Hill. She pointed to the recent Defense Intelligence Agency assessment, which found that North Korea had produced a miniaturized nuclear weapon that could be placed on a ballistic missile. There is some difference of opinion among experts on how advanced North Korea really is in terms of such a goal, but development of technology “could potentially change the strategic positions of the different countries in the region,” she said. Collins could also not recall a time when North Korea had announced a specific missile launch before it occurred, indicating a more emboldened nation. Bruce Klingner, the CIA’s Korea branch chief during the 1994 crisis, agreed that North Korea’s technological breakthroughs have changed the game, as have the uncertainty of Trump’s comments “and whether they represent a signal of resolve or a signal of impending action.” While Trump has stuck to threatening rhetoric, Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonPompeo interviewing candidates for State vacancies Trump hails Pompeo in visit to State Department Pompeo issues first tweets as secretary of State MORE have instead said the United States is “replacing the failed policy of strategic patience ... with a new policy of strategic accountability” — comments more in line with those of former President Clinton, Klingner said. “The biggest unpredictable variable is President Trump,” he said. “His comments would suggest we are on the cusp of initialing a preventative attack with North Korea, yet subsequent statements by senior officials suggest that not only are no military movements in place but that the other officials suggest no military action is imminent.” But Klingner added, “At this point, we were closer to war in 1993-1994.” A retired Marine Corps general who asked not to be named told The Hill that North Korea has historically been extremely difficult to deal and reason with, but agreed the level of brinkmanship has increased compared to 1994 due to technological advances. “I think the stakes are raised now because it was always, ‘they don’t have the technology, we don’t need to negotiate,’ the general said. “Even when we were fighting them in the Korean War there wasn’t a sense they could change our life as we know it in the homeland. Now we’ve got that risk.” While the retired general stopped short of offering an endorsement of Trump’s rhetoric, he said “it’s maybe time somebody does say something like this to this guy.” “All we’ve been doing is kicking the ball down the road, but now he’s on the edge of having the technology and using it.” |||||","completion":"US President Donald Trump has praised North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for placing on hold plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam.

What state obama was born?","completion":"Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States, was born in the state of Hawaii. He was born on August 4, 1961, at the Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women & Children in Honolulu, which is the largest city in the state of Hawaii. Hawaii is an island state situated in the Pacific Ocean and is the 50th and most recent member to join the United States. Obama's birth in Hawaii makes him the first and only president to be born outside the contiguous United States. His story and background are quite diverse and unique. His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was originally from Wichita, Kansas, while his father, Barack Obama Sr., was from Nyang'oma Kogelo, a village in Nyanza Province, Kenya. The couple met when they were both studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Throughout Obama's childhood, he lived in various locations including spending four years in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather, eventually moving back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. After finishing high school in Hawaii, Obama moved to the mainland United States to further his education. Graduating from Columbia University in New York with a degree in political science in 1983, Barack Obama then went on to earn his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1991. This provided him with the foundation to begin his career in public service, and eventually, he became a U.S. Senator representing the state of Illinois between 2005 and 2008. His rise to prominence led him to secure the Democratic nomination for president in 2008, which resulted in his election as the first African-American president of the United States. In summary, Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on August 4, 1961, making him the only U.S. president to be born in the island state. This unique upbringing and his diverse cultural background have contributed to his outlook on life and political philosophy, which shaped his presidency and legacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Even though some people might think that getting in trouble for smothering an old man is not fair, it is important that everyone understands that hurting someone is always wrong. When someone does a bad thing to another person, they must face the consequences, like being put in a timeout or getting grounded. For this woman, the timeout she got was much more serious, because her actions caused the old man's life to end. In the grown-up world, this kind of timeout is called being \\"jailed for life.\\" This means that the woman who smothered the old man will have to stay in a place called a prison for a very long time as a punishment for her bad actions.

This indicates that she is intelligent and might possess problem-solving abilities beyond what could be expected from someone her age. Unfortunately, Rose finds herself trapped in a dark, cold, and confined space, making her scared and claustrophobic. This environment is taking a toll on her emotional state, causing her to sob and slowly lose hope of getting out alive. Despite her intelligence, Rose struggles with a dilemma: she is unsure which direction to dig in order to escape her terrifying situation. The passage highlights her understanding that there may be multiple paths to safety, but choosing the wrong one could have serious consequences. This lack of certainty only adds to her mounting anxiety. In summary, Rose is an intelligent, ten-year-old girl who currently finds herself trapped in a dark, cold, and confined space. She is scared, emotionally overwhelmed, and grappling with the uncertainty of which direction to dig to find her way out."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function D(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",N,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
