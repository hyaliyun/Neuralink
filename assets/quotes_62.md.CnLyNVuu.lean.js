Here is a news article: LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tenure and other job protections for California's public school teachers were ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by a judge presiding in a lawsuit brought by nine students. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the historic case of Brown v. Board of Education in ruling that all students are entitled to equal education and said the current situation discriminates against minority and low-income students in placing ineffective teachers in their schools. \\"Plaintiffs claim that the challenged statutes result in grossly ineffective teachers obtaining and retaining permanent employment, and that these teachers are disproportionately situated in schools serving predominantly low-income and minority students,\\" the decision said. The judge said the plaintiffs' equal-protection claims validly stated that the statutes violated their fundamental rights to equality of education. \\"This court finds that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof on all issues presented,\\" he wrote. At another point in the decision, he wrote that \\"there is also no dispute that there are a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\" The ruling could have national implications because other states tackling the issue are also paying close attention to how the ruling plays out in the nation's most populous state. \\"It's powerful,\\" said Theodore Boutrous Jr., the plaintiffs' attorney who presented the case in court. \\"It's a landmark decision that can change the face of education in California and nationally.\\" Courts around the country will look at their own statutes to see how they can be changed, he said. \\"This is going to be a huge template for what's wrong with education. It will impact the national education referendum going on right now,\\" Boutrous said. Treu said evidence at the trial showed the specific effects of ineffective teachers on students. \\"The evidence is compelling,\\" he said. \\"Indeed, it shocks the conscience.\\" Based on massive study, an expert testified that a single year with a grossly ineffective teacher costs a classroom full of students 1.4 million in lifetime earnings, Treu wrote. The judge stayed implementation of the ruling pending appeals. The case only involves K-12 teachers. The California Attorney General's office said it was evaluating its legal options. \\"We are reviewing the tentative ruling and consulting with our clients,\\" said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for Attorney General Kamala Harris. He could not immediately say if the state would appeal. The California Teachers Association called the decision \\"deeply flawed\\" and vowed an appeal. \\"Circumventing the legislative process to strip teachers of their professional rights hurts our students and our schools,\\" the association said in a statement. One issue at the center of the lawsuit was whether bad teachers should be so heavily protected by tenure laws that they are almost impossible to fire. The lawsuit asked the courts to strike down several laws providing teachers with tenure, seniority-based job protection and other benefits. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy testified during the trial that it can take over two years on average to fire an incompetent tenured teacher and sometimes as long as 10. The cost of doing so, he said, can run anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000. Treu heard two months of testimony for and against the lawsuit filed by students who claim that they are being deprived of a good education. The plaintiffs said that the state's teacher tenure system, which allows only two years for evaluation before a teacher is hired permanently, does not provide sufficient time to weigh a teacher's effectiveness. The judge wrote that he was mindful of current intense political debate over education issues. He said, however, he could not allow politics to influence his ruling. \\"That this court's decision will and should result in political discourse is beyond question, but such consequence cannot and does not detract from its obligation to consider only the evidence and law in making its decision,\\" the ruling said. The judge said it is not the function of the court to dictate or advise the Legislature on how to replace the challenged statutes. All he could do is rule on the constitutionality and \\"trust the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation on the issues ... that passes constitutional muster, thus providing each child in this state with a basically equal opportunity to achieve a quality education,\\" Treu wrote. The trial represented the latest battle in a nationwide movement to abolish or toughen the standards for granting teachers permanent employment protection and seniority-based preferences during layoffs. Dozens of states have moved in recent years to get rid of or raise the standards for obtaining such protections. Lawyers for teachers object to changes that they say will allow the firing of teachers on a whim. They argue the current system preserves academic freedom and helps attract talented teachers to a profession that doesn't pay well. The lawsuit, Vergara v. California, was brought by Beatriz Vergara and eight other students who said they were saddled with teachers who let classrooms get out of control, came to school unprepared and in some cases told them they'd never make anything of themselves. The lawsuit was backed by wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Welch's nonprofit group Students Matter, which assembled a high-profile legal team including Boutrous, who represented President George W. Bush before the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2000 recount of Florida presidential ballots. Welch, who made a fortune in corporate acquisitions, says he founded Students Matter because of a passion for public education, adding both he and his three children have attended public schools. James Finberg, who represents the teachers, agreed that Treu's decision could be a bellwether for other states. With 325,000 teachers and 6 million students, California has one of the largest educational networks in the country. ||||| In a controversial ruling that could have an immediate impact on job security for teachers in California, a judge decided Tuesday that teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional. John Cádiz Klemack reports for NBC4 News at 5 p.m. from downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, June 10, 2014. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. The decision's implementation was put on hold, however, pending appeals. Teacher Tenure Laws in California Ruled Unconstitutional A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Cheryl Hurd reports. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) Vergara v. California had pitted the state and its largest teacher unions against a group of students who asked the judge to consider laws regarding teacher tenure, dismissal and seniority consideration for layoffs. A Silicon Valley-based group called Students Matter brought the lawsuit on behalf of nine students, contending the targeted laws hinder the removal of ineffective teachers and disproportionately hurt low-income and minority students. In his ruling Tuesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu cited the Supreme Court's landmark equal protection ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, saying that all students are entitled to equal education. The current laws create a situation in which minority and low-income students are discriminated against when ineffective teachers are placed in their schools, he found. Union President: Ruling Will \\"Destabilize\\" Schools A judge issues a tentative ruling, pending appeals, Tuesday regarding California's set of teacher job protection laws. John Cadiz Klemack reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Tuesday June 10, 2014. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) In the 16-page ruling, Treu said California laws on the hiring and firing of teachers have resulted in \\"a significant number of grossly ineffective teachers currently active in California classrooms.\\" He called the evidence in support of the plaintiffs' claims \\"compelling\\" and agreed that a disproportionate share of underperforming teachers are in schools that have mostly minority and low-income students. Class Action: Judge Rules Teacher Tenure Laws \\"Unconstitutional\\" A judge ruled Tuesday that California's public school teacher tenure laws are unconstitutional, after hearing testimony from students who argued the job protections made it virtually impossible to dismiss low-performing teachers. Jessica Aguirre and Jodi Hernandez report. (Published Tuesday, June 10, 2014) The ruling affects K-12 teachers in public schools. The judge wrote in his decision that it's not the court's job to determine how the state should change its laws. The court's role involved applying constitutional principles of law to the statutes and trusting \\"the Legislature to fulfill its mandated duty to enact legislation that... passes Constitutional muster.\\" Weird News Photos: Cat Shot with Arrow Lawyers for the teachers argued that changes to the job protection laws would allow teachers to be fired on a whim. Tenure laws, they argued, preserve academic freedom and help attract talented teachers to a profession that does not pay well. \\"What this is going to do is destabilize schools,\\" said United Teachers-LA president-elect Alex Caputo-Pearl. \\"Seniority, due process and right to a hearing protects investment. Top News Photos of the Week \\"It protects the district's investment because the district has trained the teacher. It protects the teachers' investment so that they can teach a curriculum that they've developed over the years. It protects the students' investment because students are involved in programs that depend on teachers.\\" State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson released the following statement on the ruling: “All children deserve great teachers. Attracting, training, and nurturing talented and dedicated educators are among the most important tasks facing every school district, tasks that require the right mix of tools, resources, and expertise. Today’s ruling may inadvertently make this critical work even more challenging than it already is. “While I have no direct jurisdiction over the statutes challenged in this case, I am always ready to assist the Legislature and Governor in their work to provide high-quality teachers for all of our students. Teachers are not the problem in our schools, they are the solution,” Torlakson said. In a phone interview, Jennifer Thomas, who represents 1,700 teachers in San Jose, California, called it a \\"dark day.\\" \\"Nobody is offering a solution for when teachers are unfairly fired,\\" she said. \\"Great teachers need to be protected from arbitrary decisions by administrators. I don't hear anybody planning to address this very real problem.\\" California Teacher Association spokesman Mike Mylinski called the ruling \\"unnecessary and misguided.\\" He would have preferred a stricter discipline process for teachers. But the plaintiffs argued that the laws make it difficult to remove ineffective teachers. The trial included testimony from Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent John Deasy, who said the process of removing an ineffective tenured teacher can take more two years on average. He estimated the cost of doing so at about 250,000 to 450,000. \\"We believe very strongly that we will prevail on appeal,\\" attorney Glen Rothner said. Deasy applauded Tuesday's \\"historic\\" ruling. \\"Every day that these laws remain in effect is an opportunity denied,\\" Deasy said. \\"It's unacceptable, and a violation of our education system's sacred pact with the public.\\" Students who said they were not afforded a good education because of the laws also testified. Julia Macias of Southern California said in a telephone news conference on Tuesday that she was \\"glad I did not stay quiet,\\" because \\"great teachers make all the difference.\\" Kate Elliott of San Carlos, another plaintiff, said she joined the suit because of a bad eighth grade teacher who had students color and watch YouTube videos and who \\"didn't really care about our education.\\" The students were backed by Atherton entrepreneur David Welch, who partnered with Griffin Schein, a consulting company that builds campaigns around social causes. The decision could have wide-ranging impact on the way California hires and fires teachers. It also could lead to changes in dozens of states with strong tenure laws that have been targeted by opponents of such policies.

As a small Scandinavian company based in Sweden, Polar could not afford to set up operations worldwide and were only ABBA's record company in the Scandinavian countries. Therefore, ABBA's recordings were licensed to different record companies in each country, but usually to companies that had international operations, meaning they could effectively compete with each other to acquire the licenses in more countries if they proved successful in their own. The licenses gave the companies a few allowances to issue certain tracks as singles that Polar had not, or to modify single (and occasionally album) artwork.

Keating, tasked to fill a \\"train, advise and assist\\" role, was killed in Iraq while helping to rescue a small team of U.S. military advisers and Kurdish forces from an attack mounted by more than 100 ISIS fighters. A decorated combat veteran and star athlete who decided to enlist after the 9/11 attacks, Keating was part of a Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq called Task Force Trident working with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters combatting ISIS. According to one account of the May clash in Iraq provided to CNN, a group of Navy SEALs and local Peshmerga forces were attacked by a large unit of ISIS fighters that had overwhelmed the Kurdish front line by rushing in with bulldozers, trucks and weapons. A group of nearly 20 SEALs including Keating was deployed to respond to the ISIS attack. During the ongoing battle, the SEALs ran low on ammunition and Keating's machine gun malfunctioned, according to initial battlefield reports. Keating went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters. It was at this point that Keating was struck by enemy fire. Two other SEALs carried him down from the roof and he was placed in a medevac helicopter, but the battle was so intense that the helicopter was also hit before managing to take him to a hospital where he was declared dead. At the time, coalition spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters that that the two-hour clash between ISIS and the Peshmerga forces the advisers were assisting was \\"a big fight, one of the largest we've seen recently.\\" But a previously unrevealed battle on March 4 equally dire and dangerous, involving pitched combat against about 100 ISIS fighters. The details of this earlier fight were revealed in the little-noticed Silver Star citation presented to Keating's family after his death on May 3. According to the citation, Keating \\"continuously exposed himself to enemy automatic weapon, mortar, and rocket grenade fire.\\" Keating kept moving on the battlefield between the front line and the flanks talking to the Peshmerga, encouraging them to keep going. In the March battle, more than 100 ISIS operatives assaulted Peshmerga lines and Keating, serving as an advisor then as in May, moved in to help repel the attack. As ISIS fighters sent a car bomb towards him, Keating led a team to counterattack with sniper and rocket fire. \\"His personal bravery inspired his comrades to vigorously defend their position and repel the enemy assault,\\" according to the citation. The Pentagon has never acknowledged the first Syrian battle. U.S. military officials say they are under no obligation to reveal the details of battles U.S. troops are involved in even if it's against a large enemy force, and they will not routinely report if a U.S. service member is wounded -- only when one is killed. The revelation of two pitched battles in the space of eight weeks between Navy SEALs and two groups each of 100 ISIS fighters underscores that Special Operations Forces being deployed to train, advise and assist local forces are in real danger of being attacked. In April President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 250 additional Special Operation Forces to Syria and described their role in a somewhat different way. While making the announcement in Hannover, Germany, Obama said, \\"They're not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces.\\" Title:","completion":"\\"Valor and Sacrifice: Uncovering Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV's Heroic Battles Against ISIS in Syria and Iraq\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

U.N. officials on Tuesday put the number of rapes and other sexual attacks in eastern Congo since late July at more than 500, more than double the previous estimate. In remarks prepared for delivery to the Security Council after returning from a fact-finding trip to the region, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Atul Khare cited 267 rapes or other sexual attacks in the town of Uvira -- on the eastern edge of the country -- and other nearby regions of North and South Kivu, in addition to the 242 rapes that had already been reported in and near the village of Luvungi. Among the additional cases was a report of 10 women raped by members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on August 17 and 18 in the community of Katalukulu, in Fizi territory, South Kivu, he said. On August 17, at least 40 rapes were committed in the village of Mubi by an alleged coalition of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and Mayi-Mayi, a militia group active in the region, he said. Another 13 rapes occurred in Pinga area in Chuho market, he said. On August 26, Khare received reports of 74 cases of sexual violence -- including 21 directed at girls 7 to 15 years of age -- and six men in the village of Miki in the territory of Mwenga, he said. The incidents occurred in July and August, he said. Five days later, he said, 130 cases of rape were recorded in several villages in the territory of Shabunda. There were reports that in one village, \\"all women might have been systematically raped,\\" he said. Khare had gone to Congo to find out why peacekeepers said they hadn't learned about the rapes near Luvungi sooner. The United Nations reported last week that some 242 people were raped by armed Congolese and Rwandan rebels in villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3. Attackers blocked roads and prevented villagers from reaching outside communications. Many homes were also looted and burned. Many of the victims were gang-raped by as many as six men at a time, according to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rapes were first publicly reported on August 22. The United Nations initially said it did not learn about the attacks until August 12, when it was alerted by International Medical Corps. That group said it first told the United Nations about the rapes on August 6. But on Tuesday, the United Nations acknowledged that it first learned of a report of rape on July 30, nearly two weeks earlier than it had previously said. \\"We can confirm that the Daily Field Security Report from North Kivu on 30 July included the following: 'Today 30 July 2010 during morning hours, the locality of Mpofi (52 Km E of Walikale) passed under control of FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] combatants. One woman was reportedly raped and locals fled towards Walikale and Kibua. More information to be ascertained.' \\"We can also confirm that, on the basis of this information, an e-mail was sent by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs transmitting information of the FDLR movement,\\" it said. The July 30 internal U.N. email was relayed to relief agencies working in the area and warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. \\"The women of eastern DRC deserve better,\\" said Margot Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict who sent a senior member of her staff with Khare on his fact-finding mission to the region. \\"For them, there is no safe place. They are raped when harvesting crops; when going to market; when fetching water and firewood; when carrying their babies; when in their homes at night, among their loved ones.\\" She added that the rape is becoming a weapon of choice in eastern DRC. \\"The sad reality is that incidents of rape have become so commonplace that they do not trigger our most urgent interventions,\\" she said. Noting that the information about the rapes \\"was slow to surface,\\" she called for the United Nations to focus on how to improve its response to such reports. \\"We should examine the U.N.'s response, including that of our peacekeepers on the ground, not in a spirit of self-recrimination but with a determination and resolve to do better to protect civilians in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex, vast and volatile conflict zones in the world.\\" She noted that some rebel leaders have been identified as having been present during the attacks and called for them to be used \\"as a starting point\\" to bring the attackers to justice. \\"Our policies of 'zero tolerance' cannot be backed by a reality of 'zero consequences,'\\" she said. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"In a place called eastern Congo, there have been many bad things happening to women and girls. U.N. officials, who are people that help make sure everyone is safe and treated fairly, found out that more than 500 women and girls were hurt and attacked in a very mean way called rape. They are trying to find out why this has happened and how to protect these women and girls better. Even though there are peacekeepers in Congo to help keep people safe, they didn't know about these attacks right away. They want to make sure they can respond faster and better to keep everyone safe. They also want to find the people who did these terrible things and make them face the consequences of their actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We should all learn from them pic.twitter.com/Vt87CaNav3 ||||| Image copyright Reuters After a heated World Cup match, the stands are usually left with food waste, cups and wrappers scattered in the heat of the moment. Japanese fans certainly had reason to go wild on Tuesday night. Their side won their opening game, beating Colombia 2-1, and securing the team's first victory against a South American side. But after the team swept Colombia off the pitch, Japanese fans also did their share of sweeping: meticulously cleaning up their rows and seats in the stadium. Equipped with large rubbish bags they brought along, the fans marched through the rows picking up rubbish, to leave the place just as neat as they had found it. And not for the first time - supporters of the \\"Samurai Blue\\" have never failed to stick to their good manners. \\"It's not just part of the football culture but part of Japanese culture,\\" Japan-based football journalist Scott McIntyre told the BBC. He is in Russia following the team and was not at all surprised by the somewhat different nature of Samurai Blue fans. \\"You often hear people say that football is a reflection of culture. An important aspect of Japanese society is making sure that everything is absolutely clean and that's the case in all sporting events and certainly also in football.\\" More on the World Cup from the BBC: A habit built from childhood Senegal fans have in fact been seen doing the same at this year's World Cup - but it's the Japanese who pioneered it and are now famous for it. It is something that comes as a surprise to many foreigners attending matches in Japan. \\"They might leave a bottle or some kind of food package on the ground and then it's often the case that people get tapped on the shoulder by Japanese people indicating they should clean up or take it home but can't leave it there,\\" Mr McIntyre says. Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan fans certainly know how to celebrate It's a habit drilled into Japanese people from early childhood. \\"Cleaning up after football matches is an extension of basic behaviours that are taught in school, where the children clean their school classrooms and hallways,\\" explains Scott North, professor of sociology at Osaka University. \\"With constant reminders throughout childhood, these behaviours become habits for much of the population.\\" What do fans make of the fact their post-match cleaning spree becomes a regular hit on social media? If anything, they're proud. \\"In addition to their heightened consciousness of the need to be clean and to recycle, cleaning up at events like the World Cup is a way Japanese fans demonstrate pride in their way of life and share it with the rest of us,\\" explains Prof North. \\"What better place to make a statement about the need to care responsibly for the planet than the World Cup?\\" he adds. It doesn't mean that there is any more or less passion, insists Mr McIntyre. It's simply that passion doesn't slip into neglect of basic rules of behaviour let alone violence. \\"I know it may sound bland and boring, but this is the reality of a country that's built on respect and politeness,\\" he laughs. \\"And this simply extends to doing respectful things in football.\\" \\"I think it's a wonderful thing that the World Cup brings so many nations and people together and get to learn and exchange these kinds of things.

Economy McDonalds Tells Workers To Budget By Getting A Second Job And Turning Off Their Heat CREDIT: McDonalds has partnered with Visa to launch a website to help its low-wage workers making an average 8.25 an hour to budget. But while the site is clearly meant to illustrate that McDonalds workers should be able to live on their meager wages, it actually underscores exactly how hard it is for a low-paid fast food worker to get by. The site includes a sample “budget journal” for McDonalds’ employees that offers a laughably inaccurate view of what it’s like to budget on a minimum wage job. Not only does the budget leave a spot open for “second job,” it also gives wholly unreasonable estimates for employees’ costs: 20 a month for health care, 0 for heating, and 600 a month for rent. It does not include any budgeted money for food or clothing. Basically every facet of this budget is unachievable. For an uninsured person to independently buy health care, he or she must shell out on average 215 a month — just for an individual plan. While some full-time McDonald’s workers do qualify for the company’s 14 a week health plan, that offer caps coverage at 10,000 a year and is often insufficient. If that person wants to eat, “moderate” spending will run them 32 a week for themselves, and 867 a month to feed a family of four. And if a fast food worker is living in a city? Well, New York City rents just reached an average of 3,000 a month. The sample budget is also available in Spanish. On another section of the site, it concludes, “You can have almost anything you want as long as you plan ahead and save for it.” Neither McDonalds nor Visa returned requests for comment by the time of publication. Last year, Bloomberg News found that it would take the average McDonalds employee one million hours of work to earn as much money as the company’s CEO. This immense wage disparity in the fast food industry has sparked a series of protests and walk-outs by low-wage workers working at fast food chains around the country — in New York, Chicago, Washington, and Seattle, to name a few cities, workers from chains including KFC, McDonalds, Burger King, and Taco Bell have spoken publicly about the need for serious wage increases across the industry. (HT: Low Pay Is Not Okay) ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Someone meant really well. We think. A few years ago, Visa and McDonald’s partnered to launch a personal finance site for McDonald’s employees to help them better manage their money. Unfortunately, whoever wrote these materials had no grasp of what it’s actually like to live on 8 or so per hour. “Helping you succeed financially is one of the many ways McDonald’s is creating a satisfying and rewarding work environment,” the site’s About page explains. The path to financial freedom, according to Visa and McDonald’s, involves turning off your heat, not buying groceries, not having children, never getting sick, and getting a second job. All of which are sound money-saving strategies, it’s true, but it’s not all that realistic to expect people to combine them. You can download their handy budget workbook yourself. First, in the “income” column, you, the Hypothetical McDonald’s Employee, have two jobs. One job pays 1,105 per month, and the other pays 955 per month. This amount is what someone would earn working roughly 60 hours a week at 8.50 an hour. If you earn less per hour than that or this is after taxes, then you’re either working more hours or have a higher hourly wage. The budget doesn’t specify whether this is gross income or after taxes: even for someone in a low enough tax bracket that they pay no federal or state income taxes, Social Security and Medicare still takes 6.2% out of every check. Anyway, Visa and McDonald’s produced a handy workbook for employees to learn how to budget their money, spend sensibly, and save for the future and for emergencies. UPDATE: McDonald’s and Visa have apparently listened to [some of] the Internet’s criticisms, and changed the budget to include heat. They sneakily replaced the PDF workbook on the server with the new version, but we downloaded the original and have had it on the server for you all this time. The version on their site now allows 50, so that’s nice of them. Here’s the revised budget: Savings: 100 No quibble with this. Everyone should be putting some money in a savings account (or shoebox, whatever, but a savings account is a better idea.) Mortgage/Rent: 600 This is a realistic figure in most of the country if you share a home with family or roommates, but not so much if you live by yourself or don’t yet have good enough credit to get a fixed-rate mortgage on a modest condo. Car Payment: 150 Not a bad figure, but that’s probably an older car, so hope you have money put away for repairs. Car/Home Insurance: 100 That sounds pretty reasonable, though again, a person working to rebuild their credit might not get a great rate on carinsurance. Hey, wait a second, there isn’t any more mention of a car on this budget. How are you supposed to repair and maintain this vehicle? Even changing your own oil and having a friend do major repairs in their front lawn costs money for parts. That might not be a problem, though, because there’s also no budget line for gasoline. Guess you’ll be making a car payment while you walk to work. Health Insurance: 20 I don’t know what planet has health insurance plans that cost 20/month, but can I move there? Even a lot of civil service and union workers pay more than that now. Plus, insurance is nice and all, but there are these things called “co-payments” that also cost money. The cheaper your health insurance is, the higher those payments will be. Also, I miss those heady days when I was so young and healthy that I never had to buy cold medicine, bandages, painkillers, or cough syrup. Which was never. Heating: 0 This is the case for a large portion of the year, and people in some parts of the country never turn on their heat. The rest of the time, maybe you’ll have to bring leftover hamburger buns home and burn them for warmth. Cable/Phone: 100 No, heat, no groceries, but a phone and basic cable. Or a smartphone with a large data plan. Or cable, home Internet access, and no mobile phone. Hmm. Electric: 90 Maybe in the spring and fall, but good luck with that when you start running air conditioners and baseboard heat. Other: 100 Is this where the gas goes? Spending Money: 800 Okay! Straight into savings with you, then! Except, wait…this is a terrible budget. Besides leaving out gas, heat, car maintenance, and remotely realistic medical expenses, it leaves out clothes, entertainment, furniture, various kinds of personal hygiene, furniture, charitable and religious giving, cleaning supplies, and groceries. GROCERIES. It also completely ignores that you might have children, which is convenient, because it’s hard to fit child care for those 60 hours a week that you’re working into this budget. Assuming that you can even get that many hours from your job: maybe it’s time to start looking for a third one. Like we said, whoever produced this workbook probably meant well. It has helpful and slightly condescending money-saving tips, like: When possible, use public transportation or carpool Consider walking or riding a bike when running errands Plan meals in advance Borrow books and movies from the library Shop with a list Pay down debt as quickly as possible Try not to use an ATM outside of your bank’s system to avoid extra service charges We would probably just roll our eyes and move on, if it weren’t for this tiny thing on the McDonald’s Practical Money Skills page. The first page on the navigation bar of this site produced by McDonald’s and Visa extolls the benefits of prepaid debit cards. Where have I heard about those recently? Why should you consider getting your paycheck on a PaychekPLUS! Elite® Visa® Payroll Card? There are ways to access your money that don’t even involve any fees, you can use it to pay bills, and there’s no waiting. You don’t have to cash or deposit a check, and you don’t need to have a bank account. You can just use the card right away to pay for things. Just don’t gas up your car or go to the grocery store.

A:","completion":"Michael Roach, born on October 5th, 1958, is a well-known Australian rules footballer. Standing tall at 193 centimeters and weighing 92 kilograms, Roach was a formidable and skilled player on the field. Originally from Longford, he participated in the Northern Tasmanian Football League (NTFL) before making strides in his professional career. In 1977, Michael Roach joined the Richmond Football Club, which marked the beginning of his illustrious career in the Australian Football League (AFL, formerly known as the Victorian Football League, VFL). Roach's association with Richmond spanned over 12 years, until his retirement in 1989. This period saw Roach become one of the mainstays of the team thanks to his exceptional talent, athleticism, and dedication to the sport. During his tenure with Richmond, Roach displayed remarkable skill as a forward, gaining a reputation as a goal-scoring machine who had an innate ability to find the ball and deliver it to his fellow teammates with precision. His quick thinking and strategic playstyles set him apart from other players, and he became an integral part of Richmond’s successes throughout the years. Roach's achievements with the club include participating in the 1980 Grand Final, in which Richmond emerged as the winner, securing their 10th VFL/AFL premiership. Individually, Roach earned several awards and accolades during his playing career at Richmond, such as winning the club's leading goal kicker award on five occasions and being named an All-Australian player in both 1980 and 1983. In addition to his club assignments, Roach also had the honor of representing his state, Victoria, in interstate football matches, where his skills and experience were highly valued. His involvement in these games further established Roach's position as one of Australia's most respected and talented athletes.

Summarize: Six months on from the UK referendum, the process of leaving the EU is enveloped by a cloud of unknowing. The uncertainty does not relate to Britain's eventual departure, rather to how it will be achieved and at what cost. Since June almost every comment from key cabinet ministers and leaders in Europe has been faithfully reported and dissected but, for all the words spoken, there is little clarity. Indeed - certainly in the foreign ministries and the halls of Brussels - there is scarcely-concealed irritation with the blandness of government statements about doing the best for Britain or favouring a \\"smooth and orderly process\\". And, as I witnessed in Italy, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson did not get the best reviews when he cited the UK's consumption of 300 million bottles of Prosecco as evidence of an enduring trading relationship. What the government would like, would be to stay in the EU's single market while reducing the numbers of EU migrants. That is not possible, says a chorus of EU leaders, despite their own misgivings about immigration, insisting there will be no compromise over freedom of movement. The Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen was the latest politician to warn \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch. Not even for a country like Britain... So, if the EU is to stay open to Britain, then Britain has to follow the same rules as other countries, like Norway.\\" And that, of course, would mean accepting the politically impossible: freedom of movement. And rulings of the European Court of Justice. So it is presumed the UK will leave the single market. But powerful voices are pushing back, warning of the economic damage that leaving the single market would do. As the year draws to a close, all the signs point to a messy divorce. When negotiations start in April, after Article 50 has been triggered, there is one underlying reality: Europe's leaders will not allow the UK to get a better deal than it would have got by staying in the EU. Most of those heads of government are quick to deny they want to punish Britain but, on the other hand, they believe the UK must be seen to hurt. Voters in the Netherlands and France must not be tempted to try the exit path. Francois Hollande, shortly to fade from the political scene, speaks for many when he says the Brexit deal must \\"serve as an example for those who seek the end of Europe\\". Privately many senior European officials concede they are facing an existential threat: that anti-establishment parties threaten the future of the Union. However unlikely, a victory for Marine Le Pen in France would set France on the road to its own EU referendum. If there were to be a Leave vote it is hard to imagine the EU surviving without France. So, when the UK/EU negotiations start, the instincts in Europe's capitals will be, first and foremost, to protect the Union. Brussels insists that the divorce must come first. It will not talk about trade until the terms of withdrawal have been agreed. And those early talks will include highly controversial issues like how much Britain must pay to exit, to settle its accounts, and to cover obligations like staff pensions. In Brussels they put the total figure at 50bn euros (Â£42bn) or higher. The expectation in Brussels is that the terms of the divorce will be agreed by March 2019 but not much else. Once the initial deal is concluded, the chief negotiator on the EU side, Michel Barnier, favours moving to a transitional period while the terms of the trade agreement are worked out. Everyone, it seems, has a transition timetable. Some believe a five-year period may be necessary. The UK chancellor and the Bank of England have spoken of a transition lasting two to three years to provide clarity for the business and financial community. A trade deal took the Canadians seven years and it still has not been ratified although, unlike Canada, the UK already trades under EU laws and regulations. Even if it makes sense, a transition period will pose some awkward political questions. Would the UK still have to contribute to the EU budget or continue to accept the primacy of EU law? And how about freedom of movement? Theresa May could find herself going into an election in 2020 with divorce papers signed but much of what the public most dislikes about the EU still in place. It is also doubtful whether a transition period would deliver the reassurance that is claimed for it. Banks and financial companies want a continuation of what they call \\"passporting\\" - the right to sell their services anywhere in the EU. But there are signs that some companies will not put up with years of uncertainty. One of Japan's banks has already said it will expand operations in Amsterdam. Other international banks have warned that they will reduce their footprint in London and open posts in the EU within six months if there is no further clarity. Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has said it will move part of its operation to the EU. All kinds of ideas have been floated - that the UK could pay in order for certain sectors to continue to have access to the single market - but that carries political risks for the government. There are some positive signs of international companies continuing to invest in Britain, but what the government fears is a steady drip of departures that could only encourage others to follow. Unfolding in the New Year will be a game of strategy and a game of power. Sometime, probably in February, the government will declare what it seeks from the negotiations without revealing its negotiating strategy. Thousands of businesses and financial companies will be watching and asking whether the plan provides a convincing road map for the years ahead and, above all, whether it protects their commercial interests.","completion":"Six months after the UK referendum, uncertainty about Brexit remains, specifically how it will be achieved and at what cost.

Summarize: France's deficit will \\"without a doubt\\" be 3.7% of its output this year, he said, above the 3% he promised to cut it to during the election last year. The 3% deficit target is also one set by the European Union - but most of the major euro nations are in breach. The news comes as France's economic progress was criticised by a European Central Bank board member. \\"The reform course in France seems to have floundered,\\" Germany's Jens Weidmann said. \\"The crisis that we are facing is a crisis of confidence, and this confidence cannot be gained if we postpone the tackling of the root causes of the crisis,\\" Mr Weidmann said, referring to France, Italy and Cyprus as countries that still face tough financial situations. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been effectively shut out of borrowing long term on international financial markets, which forced them to seek help from European partners and the International Monetary Fund. They all adopted austerity policies to cut public spending, but France has bucked the trend, raising taxes instead to protect its social model. During the election last year, Mr Hollande vowed to bring the deficit to 3% from its current 4.5% and had insisted this was possible until now admitting defeat. But he defended his record, saying that the deficit has come down from more than 5% in 2011. \\"In two years, we have performed a structural recovery,\\" the president said on Tuesday, that \\"is as unprecedented as it is significant\\". \\"Addressing our accounts is a financial obligation... but it is also an obligation of sovereignty because France must never be in difficulty in the markets.\\" The ECB's other German board member, Joerg Asmussen, last month urged France to take \\"concrete and measurable\\" steps to bring down its budget deficit.

This article offers a comprehensive guide on the appropriate protective gear to wear and safety practices to adopt while operating machinery and power tools. By adhering to these safety precautions, you can minimize the risk of accidents and ensure a safe and productive working environment. The Importance of Protective Gear 1. Protective gloves One of the primary risks when operating machinery or power tools is cutting or slicing your hands. This unfortunate incident can lead to severe injuries, infections, and even long-lasting physical disabilities. To reduce the risk of hand injuries, it is crucial to wear protective gloves specifically designed for the task at hand. Protective gloves can be made of different materials such as leather, Kevlar, or heavy-duty rubber, offering varying levels of protection against cuts, punctures, and abrasion. 2. Safety earmuffs When operating power tools or machinery, one of the most overlooked safety concerns is the impact of noise on the user's hearing. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels during operation can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. To protect your ears from loud noise generated by power tools, it is advisable to wear safety earmuffs. These hearing protectors help reduce the exposure to hazardous noise levels, ensuring that your hearing remains intact throughout the years. 3. Safety goggles Eye protection is another essential safety measure to adopt when working with machinery and power tools. Dust, debris, and flying particles can easily enter the eyes, causing irritation and, in some cases, even blindness. To protect your vision, it is essential to wear safety goggles or glasses while operating any equipment. Choosing the right eyewear safety gear that meets the appropriate safety standards and provides a comfortable fit will ensure optimum eye protection. 4. Choosing proper attire The clothing you wear while working with machinery and power tools should be carefully selected to minimize the risk of accidents. Loose-fitting clothing, for instance, can easily get caught in the moving parts of machinery, leading to serious injuries. Hence, it is crucial to wear fitting clothes that do not have parts that may get entangled with the tool you are operating. Moreover, wearing open-toed shoes poses a risk of injuries from dropping heavy objects, stepping on sharp items, or accidental slips. To protect your feet, it is wise to choose closed-toe shoes, preferably ones with slip-resistant soles and reinforced toe caps. 5. Securing long hair People with long hair should take extra precautions when working with machinery and power tools. Long hair can easily get caught in the moving parts of equipment, causing severe scalp and head injuries. To prevent such accidents, always tie up your hair using a hairband, bun, or ponytail so that it remains away from the moving parts of the machinery. Conclusion Investing your time and effort in adhering to safety precautions will significantly increase your protection while working with machinery and power tools. By using protective gloves, safety earmuffs, safety goggles, choosing appropriate clothing, and securing long hair, you can mitigate potential hazards and minimize the risks of accidents, ultimately promoting a safer working environment. Remember that safety should always be the primary priority whenever you embark on any project involving machinery and power tools."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. John is a doctor with the local hospital. Earlier today, he was seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John found out that patient A had more LDL, but patient B had more HDL. He now needs to determine correct treatment for them. Which patient would see less build up in the inner walls of the arteries, patient A or patient B? Answer:","completion":"Patient B would see less build-up in the inner walls of the arteries, due to having a higher level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is known as the \\"good\\" cholesterol. HDL cholesterol helps in removing excess LDL cholesterol, or the \\"bad\\" cholesterol, from the bloodstream, thus reducing the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis, as well as heart attack and stroke. On the other hand, Patient A, with more LDL cholesterol, is at a higher risk of plaque formation in the inner walls of their arteries, increasing their chances of developing atherosclerosis and associated complications. As a doctor, John should consider creating individualized treatment plans for both patients, accounting for their specific cholesterol levels and potential risk factors. For Patient A, John might recommend strategies to lower their LDL cholesterol levels, including diet modifications, such as reducing saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intake, regular aerobic exercise, and potentially prescribing medications like statins, if necessary. For Patient B, while their higher HDL cholesterol levels are beneficial, it is also essential to assess any other risk factors and monitor their overall health. John should focus on encouraging them to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity, to support their HDL cholesterol levels and decrease the potential risks associated with cardiovascular disease. It is crucial to remember that treatment plans should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of each patient and may require adjustments over time to ensure optimal health outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Director Richard Murray said owner Roland Duchatelet had \\"underestimated\\" the Championship, from which the Addicks were relegated in April. \\"It is not easy to say you have made mistakes. The important thing is we learn from those going forward,\\" Slade told BBC Radio London. Charlton appointed three different head coaches as they dropped back into League One for the first time since 2011-12, with Jose Riga resigning following the last game of the season on 7 May. Duchatelet has made six managerial changes since taking over the south-east London club in January 2014, with former Brighton, Leyton Orient and Cardiff boss Slade becoming the first British boss to be appointed by the Belgian businessman. \\"There was a willingness to put things right and move the club forward and I was quite excited by that,\\" Slade added. \\"They have made a start by appointing a British manager - somebody that knows the league and their way around. \\"The fact I know a lot of people - players and managers - will help the club.\\" Slade believes he is capable of repairing the relationship between the club and its fans, which has become increasingly strained since the turn of the year.

Options: - bathroom - couch - airport - homes - bed Explain why a human would choose \\"bed\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"To answer the question about where Danny might have been, it's important to first understand the context and then eliminate the options that are less likely. Step 1: Understand the context Danny is a human who needed to catch a flight, so we know that he probably needed to be at the airport. However, he stayed too long in an object meant for humans to relax in. Step 2: Eliminate unlikely options Since we know he needed to catch a flight, it is unlikely that he was staying too long in a \\"bathroom,\\" \\"homes,\\" or \\"couch,\\" as these are typically not locations where people prepare to catch flights. Step 3: Compare remaining options Now we are left with two options: \\"airport\\" and \\"bed.\\" While an airport is where he would need to be to catch his flight, the context mentions an object designed for relaxation, which would lead more towards \\"bed.\\" Step 4: Justify the choice A human would choose \\"bed\\" as the answer because beds are objects specifically designed for relaxation and rest. It is common for people to accidentally stay in bed longer than they should, especially if they are tired or not paying attention to the time. In comparison, the \\"airport\\" option is a location and not an object for relaxation.

Review: I would like to award this author and her bookminus 10 stars if I could!(goodie that rhymes, could I get published too?!) Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review provided is negative in nature. There are a few key factors that indicate this evaluation has a negative connotation: 1. The reviewer desires to award the author and her book with \\"-10 stars.\\" This suggests that they were not just disappointed with the book, but that they felt it was so terrible that it merits an award lower than the lowest possible rating, which indicates a great degree of dissatisfaction. 2. The reviewer brings up the element of rhyme by stating, \\"Goodie that rhymes, could I get published too?!\\" This sarcastic remark mocks the author's apparent focus on creating rhyme in their work, as if rhyme alone would be enough to make the book good. It also hints that the reviewer believes the author's work is not genuinely worth being published because the rhyme seems to be the only significant aspect of the work. 3. The reviewer asks a rhetorical question within their statement, while also expressing a negative emotion by saying \\"as long as it rhymes.\\" This implies that the reviewer disagrees with the idea that a book should be considered valuable just because it contains rhymes. The heavy sarcasm also accentuates their negative assessment of the book's perceived shortcomings in quality and substance. While the context provided does not go into specifics about the author's book, it can be safely concluded from the review that the reviewer had an unfavorable experience with the book and does not consider it to be worth recommending. The negative language, usage of sarcasm, and rhetorical questions make it clear that the reviewer's opinion of \\"As long as it rhymes...\\" is decidedly negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If so,that's a good thing.There are many benefits to reading.Getting into a good novel improves our literacy .But who or what encourages us to pick up a book and start reading? Of course,when we are young,our parents and teachers inspire us by introducing us to characters that we love--or love to hate.And there are the authors--the people who invent and write about these characters.Good writing can really catch our imagination. One modern-day children's author is J.K.Rowling,who's known for her books about the wizard,Harry Potter.Last year she was named as a'literacy hero'for her part in improving people's love of reading.The UK's National Literacy Trust awarded her the title for\\"turning a generation of children into readers.\\" The Trust also honoured schoolchildren,a librarian and teachers for their effort in trying to get people to read.The actor, Henry Winkler, who has dyslexia ,was also named for the books he has written about a boy with learning difficulties. Reading books is more than an enjoyable pastime;it can also help people in difficult circumstances.The author Pat Winslow worked as a writer in prisons and found reading and discussing stories helped prisoners reflect on their patterns of behaviour.She says\\"Very often we would have discussions about the moral compass of a character, what was the motivation of somebody, why did they behave that way?\\" Today I like to read factual books such as biographies,where you get an insight into the lives of important and well-known people.I also enjoy looking at travel books and learning about journeys and new destinations.It's a good substitute if you can't visit in person. But the main benefit of reading is the improvement it brings to our literacy.The more we do it,the better we get and who knows--one day you may become the next Tolstoy,Jackie Collins or even William Shakespeare.

Answer: The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: To open the traditional desktop environment on various computer systems, you first need to understand how each operating system handles this environment. While the method may differ depending on the operating system, the general idea is the same: accessing a user interface that allows for running and managing desktop applications. Below, we will discuss how to open the traditional desktop environment on some major platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux-based systems. 1. Windows: In the case of Windows, the desktop environment is often prominently displayed to users. When you boot up your computer and log in to your user account, you are usually presented with the desktop environment by default. - For Windows 7 and earlier versions: After logging in, you will be directly shown the traditional desktop environment. It consists of a taskbar at the bottom, which includes the Start button, application shortcuts, system-tray icons, and a clock. - For Windows 8 and 8.1: Opening the traditional desktop environment might be a bit less intuitive, as these operating systems introduced the \\"Start Screen\\" with large, touch-friendly tiles. To access the desktop environment, click or tap on the \\"Desktop\\" tile from the Start screen. - For Windows 10: Microsoft reintroduced the Start menu as a combination of traditional desktop elements and the modern tiles from Windows 8. When you log in, you are automatically presented with the desktop environment, and the taskbar contains the Start button, application shortcuts, system tray icons, and a clock. 2. macOS: In macOS, the \\"Desktop\\" and the \\"Desktop Environment\\" are considered synonymous. Once your Mac has finished booting up and you have logged in, you are immediately presented with your desktop environment. The desktop environment typically includes the Menu bar at the top, the Dock at the bottom or the side containing application and folder icons, and the desktop wallpaper with any user-created files and folders saved on the desktop. If your system is set up to display multiple virtual desktops (using macOS's Spaces feature), you can switch between them using the Mission Control interface or by swiping left or right with multiple fingers on your trackpad or mouse. 3. Linux: The traditional desktop environment in Linux-based systems heavily depends on which \\"Desktop Environment\\" (such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) and distribution (like Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc.) you are using. However, accessing the main desktop environment is generally straightforward after logging in to your user account. For example, if you are using Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment, you will be presented with the desktop environment, including the default wallpaper, a top panel with application menus, status icons, and a clock. To access applications, you can click on the \\"Activities\\" button in the top-left corner or search for them using the search feature. In conclusion, the process of opening the traditional desktop environment differs slightly between various operating systems. Still, the core idea remains the same: presenting users with an interface for managing and launching desktop applications seamlessly."},{"prompt":"Q:You are presented with the question \\"Buried vegetation in a wetland changes to peat over what?\\" and the following answer choices: - a long period of time - The area was once underwater - a brief period of time - just a day's time - Physical weathering - It used to be covered by water - movements in the earth's crust - a quick period of time Now knowing that being burried under soil and mud changes vegetation into peat through extreme heat and pressure in a swamp over a long period of time and wetlands Wetlands are also called swamps or marshes, choose the best answer.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A reconnaissance aircraft is a manned or unmanned military aircraft designed, or adapted, to carry out aerial reconnaissance. Their roles are to collect imagery intelligence, signals intelligence, and measurement and signature intelligence. - A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type. Military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat: - Aviation is the practical aspect or art of aeronautics, being the design, development, production, operation and use of aircraft, especially heavier than air aircraft. The word \\"aviation\\" was coined by French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863, from the verb \\"avier\\" (synonymous flying), itself derived from the Latin word \\"avis\\" (\\"bird\\") and the suffix \\"-ation\\". - The AEG C.V was a prototype two - seat biplane reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. Designed to utilise a more powerful engine than previous AEG C - class reconnaissance aircraft , results were disappointing enough that further development was cancelled . - Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is intelligence-gathering by interception of signals, whether communications between people (communications intelligenceabbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligenceabbreviated to ELINT). Signals intelligence is a subset of intelligence collection management. - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - Aerial reconnaissance is reconnaissance for a military or strategic purpose that is conducted using reconnaissance aircraft. This role can fulfil a variety of requirements, including the collection of imagery intelligence, observation of enemy maneuvers and artillery spotting. - Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence gathering, which serves to detect, track, identify or describe the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar intelligence, acoustic intelligence, nuclear intelligence, and chemical and biological intelligence. MASINT is defined as scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments for the purpose of identifying any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter or sender, to facilitate the latters measurement and identification. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Imagery intelligence (IMINT) is an intelligence gathering discipline which collects information via satellite and aerial photography. As a means of collecting intelligence, IMINT is a subset of intelligence collection management, which, in turn, is a subset of intelligence cycle management. IMINT is especially complemented by non-imaging MASINT electro-optical and radar sensors. - The Wright Flyer (often retrospectively referred to as Flyer I or 1903 Flyer) was the first successful heavier-than-air powered aircraft. It was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near Kill Devil Hills, about four miles south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Explanation: When food supplies dry up, it leads to a decrease in the number of organisms in an ecosystem due to starvation and a lack of resources for survival. This causes an increase in the number of organisms that die. This indirectly impacts the first step of the process, which is the death of the organism. As there are more dead organisms, the following steps in the formation of fossils may also be affected – more decomposition, scattering of bones by scavengers, wind and rain, and potential fossilization. However, the perturbation doesn't directly change the steps themselves but rather affects the frequency and occurrence of the events in those steps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So far, only two countries in the world--the prefix = st1 /USAandFrance--have ever produced them. But these frightful fighting machines are about to enter Asia. The US Navy said last month that one of its nine nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be sent to Japanto replace the diesel-powered carrier Kitty Hawk in 2009 in an agreement on October 30th. The two countries also planned to level up their military cooperation and theUSAcalled forJapanto take a large role in alliance military moves. It will be the first time that a nuclear-powered carrier is based in Japan. Bombed byUSforces in World War II at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,Japanis the only world country to have been attacked by a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the citizens are highly sensitive to where nuclear-powered weapons are based. \\"A radiation leak at Yokosuka would kill 100,000 people as far away as Tokyo, and could cause billions of dollars in damage,\\" said Masahiko Go to, leader of a protest group inYokosuka. His group has collected more than 300,000 signatures of people acrossJapanopposed to the nuclear carrier. The 44-year-old Kitty Hawk, the USnavy's oldest active ship, has been based in Yokosuda since 1998. The new carrier, yet to be _ , will travel faster, be capable of supporting longer operations and carry with it the Navy's most modern technology. Experts pointed that this change is not only to strengthen the US-Japan military alliance but also to keep the military power of ChinaandNorth Koreawithin limits. However, Japanese experts don't believe that the countries are threats to the region. \\"There is no need for Japanto have a nuclear carrier as defense,\\" said Tetsuo Maeda, an international relations professor atTokyoInternationalUniversity. He said that the change of ship indicates an increased military capacity, in the region, much more than what is needed.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more adults become elderly happens, how will it affect LESS babies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. If more adults become elderly, this means that the overall life expectancy of the population is increasing. 2. With a higher life expectancy, it is likely that people are remaining healthy and able-bodied for longer periods and therefore may choose to have children later in life. 3. Delaying childbearing can contribute to a decrease in overall fertility rates, as couples may choose to have fewer children due to the later start in their family life, or they may face decreased fertility as they age. 4. Lower fertility rates and later childbearing can ultimately result in fewer babies being born.

Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which event happened first, AUMF becoming law, or the attacks on 11 September 2001?","completion":"Title: AUMF and the Attacks on September 11th, 2001: The Chronology of Events Introduction Debate frequently arises on the sequence of historical events, particularly those with significant geopolitical consequences. This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the chronological order of events surrounding the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the attacks on September 11, 2001. By examining these events that shaped modern international relations and policies, readers will receive a clear understanding of which event preceded the other. The Attacks on September 11, 2001 On the fateful morning of September 11, 2001, the United States experienced unprecedented terror attacks, as a series of four coordinated suicide strikes targeted significant landmarks across the nation. This deadly act of terrorism was orchestrated by the Islamist extremist group Al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Osama bin Laden. The attacks began with the hijacking of four passenger airlines: American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77, and United Airlines Flight 93. At precisely 8:46 AM (EDT), American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. Shortly after, at 9:03 AM, United Airlines Flight 175 flew into the South Tower, creating a massive explosion upon impact. The ensuing destruction and eventual collapse of the two towers resulted in the tragic loss of nearly 3,000 lives. Simultaneously, American Airlines Flight 77 was flown into the Pentagon, causing significant damage and claiming the lives of 189 people. The last hijacked plane, United Airlines Flight 93, targeted Washington, D.C.; however, the heroic efforts of passengers on board led to the plane crashing into a field in Pennsylvania, preventing further devastation. The aftermath of the September 11 attacks had profound implications for the United States, as it marked the beginning of the War on Terror, a comprehensive response to terrorism globally. Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) is a joint resolution passed by the United States Congress on September 14, 2001, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 18, 2001. The AUMF granted the President the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those determined to have planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11th attacks on the United States, or harbored such organizations or persons. The AUMF has been the legal foundation for military actions against terrorist groups involved in the 9/11 attacks, as well as their affiliates. Notably, the AUMF has provided the authorization for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, resulting in the toppling of the Taliban regime and the beginning of the long-term conflict in the country. Furthermore, the AUMF has often been cited as the legal basis for drone strikes, surveillance programs, and prolonged detention of enemy combatants in locations such as Guantanamo Bay. Critics argue that the vagueness and lack of expiration date for the AUMF have led to an overreach of executive power and a persistent state of global conflict. Conclusion In conclusion, it is evident that the attacks on September 11, 2001, occurred first, followed by the enactment of the Authorization for Use of Military Force. The attacks, which resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives and caused significant destruction across the United States, marked a turning point in the country's political and military landscape. The AUMF was enacted as a direct response to the attacks, granting the President the power to wage a war against terrorism and pursue justice for the victims. The post-9/11 period has been characterized by the expansion of military activities under the AUMF, leaving a lasting impact on international relations and security policies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A judge sentences Haley to her ultimate nightmare, attending an elite gymnastics academy run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges).Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. She made it to the World Championships, but the previous year she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.After arriving at the school, Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and after that, she can leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement.

Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage, behind the defensive linemen, and therefore \\"back up the line.\\" Linebackers generally align themselves before the ball is snapped by standing upright in a \\"two point stance\\" (as opposed to the defensive linemen, who put one or two hands on the ground for a \\"three point stance\\" or \\"four point stance\\" before the ball is snapped). - In American and Canadian football, a line of scrimmage is an imaginary transverse line (across the width of the football field) beyond which a team cannot cross until the next play has begun. Its location is based on the spot where the ball is placed after the end of the most recent play and following the assessment of any penalty yards. - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).

The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season. The next game, Super Bowl LI, scheduled for February 5, 2017, will follow the 2016 regular season. - Jeff Bentrim (born June 21, 1965) was an American football player who played quarterback.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Premise: As Cruise moves past the fornicating satyrs and satyrettes to the euphonious dronings of Jocelyn Plook's music, one feels Kubrick, at last, is in his element. Hypothesis: Kubrick is not within his element with the fornicating satyrs and euphonious droning of the chosen music. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to contradict each other in their assessments of whether Kubrick is in his element or not. In order to thoroughly investigate this, we need to delve deeper into the statement, the context, and the potential interpretations. Firstly, the premise sets up the scenario of Cruise's character moving through a scene filled with fornicating satyrs and satyrettes, accompanied by the music of Jocelyn Plook. This scene is described as a potential showcase for Kubrick's talents, implying that this particular combination of visuals and sounds is a fitting representation of his creative abilities and unique filmmaking style. The statement also highlights a certain level of comfort that Kubrick feels in crafting this kind of scene, where potentially controversial or provocative imagery meets equally experimental and captivating auditory inputs. On the other hand, the hypothesis counters the premise by stating that Kubrick is actually not within his element with the fornicating satyrs, suggesting that the visual design of the scene might not reflect his creative visions, interests, or strengths. This is further emphasized with the mention of the chosen music, implying that the integration of Jocelyn Plook's euphonious droning might not suit Kubrick's artistic intentions or preferences. The hypothesis insinuates that this scene fails to capture Kubrick's essence as a filmmaker and might not be the best fit for his cinematic language and interests. Analyzing both the premise and hypothesis, we observe that they present opposing views on whether Kubrick is in his element in this specific scene. The premise posits that the scene suits Kubrick's style and that he is comfortable in orchestrating it. Conversely, the hypothesis asserts that the combination of visuals and music is not aligned with Kubrick's artistic vision. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as they provide contrasting perspectives on Kubrick's disposition and relationship with the scene in question. In fact, they raise a complex and fascinating discussion about the nature of artistic creativity, subjective interpretation, and the interplay between different elements in a filmmaker's work. The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis may also be influenced by individual interpretations of Kubrick's body of work and personal creative style, thus leaving room for further debate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This added heat may lead to the formation of more magma and molten rock, resulting in an increase in volcanic activity. As the heated magma rises through the cracks in the Earth's crust, additional pressure may be exerted on the tectonic plates, which could lead to more movement and the potential for more volcanic eruptions. This is because the increased heat can cause a reduction in the viscosity of the Earth's mantle, allowing for easier movement of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface. Increased heat can also cause the expansion of the Earth's crust. This expansion might lead to the opening of new cracks and fissures, allowing magma to rise to the surface more readily. As a result, this increase in heat could lead to a greater frequency and intensity of volcanic eruptions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the sentence \\"Several people are at an outdoor event near a tent.\\", is the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, which states, \\"Several people are at an outdoor event near a tent.\\" In order to determine the truth of the second sentence, it is essential to analyze and break down the key components of the original sentence. 1. \\"Several people\\": This phrase indicates that more than one individual is being discussed. The term 'several' implies a small but unspecified number of people. 2. \\"Outdoor event\\": This phrase suggests that the gathering or occasion is taking place outside of an enclosed space, meaning that it is happening in an open area such as a park, garden, or plaza. The word 'outdoor' highlights the fact that the event occurs in an external environment. 3. \\"Near a tent\\": This part of the sentence provides extra information about the specific location of the event, making it clear that the people are not only outside but also in proximity to a tent. Tents are typically used for temporary shelter or as a base for various activities at outdoor gatherings. Given these key pieces of information, it can be concluded that the people being referred-to in the original sentence are indeed located outside. Consequently, the sentence \\"People are outside.\\" stands as a true statement based on the information presented in the first sentence. This is because \\"outside\\" is synonymous with being in an outdoor setting, which aligns with the context established by the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Water is added to the dry mixture to bind all the components together. In a concrete mixer, add the determined amount of water and then the concrete mix. You can also mix this in a wheelbarrow with a shovel. Use as little water as possible. Water makes the concrete more maneuverable but it also weakens the constitution of the final product. A drier mix makes the concrete more crack resistant. Turn on the machine. The mix will become smooth and consistent. Shut off the machine. You can sometimes get a truck to pour concrete straight into your form; otherwise, load it into wheelbarrows and tilt them into the form until the high point is reached. While doing this, enlist some helpers to spread out the concrete with shovels, rakes and \\"come alongs,\\" which is a special concrete rake. Starting at the uphill point, use a screeding tool to flatten out the wet concrete. Screeding involves jiggling a wide plank of wood back and forth, if possible immediately over the forms, to create a flat surface. Work your way from top to bottom, gently screeding until you have a flat surface. Your concrete surface won't be finished yet, but it will begin to look more complete and professional looking at this point. At this point, you should move fairly quickly as the concrete will set fast. Your floating process will contain two steps: Use a large floating device, also known as a bull float, to press down aggregate and help the cream (gravel-free concrete) rise to the surface. Do this by moving the bull float away from you, keeping the tailing edge slightly elevated, and then moving the bull float back towards you, keeping the leading edge slightly elevated. Use a magnesium hand float to go over the surface. After some of the water bleeds to the surface, use long sweeping motions with your hand float. Line up a plank as a straight edge to make periodic joints in the concrete. These joints will help the concrete withstand cracking due to temperature changes. Cut the joints about a quarter of the thickness of the concrete. Use a broom to sweep across the surface, creating designs. This will provide traction on the concrete so it is not as slippery when wet. A soft brush can also be used for a different texture that is less rough. For a smoother surface, but one that still has a pattern to it, you can use the trowel and slide it over the surface in a circular motion. Make sure the grooves are not so deep that water stands on the surface. Standing water will compromise the integrity of the concrete. If moving the broom over the concrete causes clumps of concrete to aggregate on your broom, it's too early to broom. Move over the concrete again with the magnesium floater to smooth out the pattern left by the broom, then try again later. Concrete should be left to cure for 28 days, with the initial day being the most critical. As soon as the concrete has been poured, professionals usually recommend sealing the concrete. The sealant will help the concrete cure, as well as prevent cracks and discoloration. Although concrete is often thought of an a no-hassle surface, it benefits from regular maintenance. Regular soap and water maintenance will help keep the concrete looking its best, while occasional seals (~ every five years) can help keep the concrete from getting damaged through use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to mix and work with concrete. It tells us that we need to mix Portland cement, sand, and gravel with water to make concrete. Then, we can pour the concrete into a shape we want and smooth it out using special tools like a screed and a float. After that, we can add patterns or textures to the surface to make it less slippery when wet.

A primary school teacher who hit a six-year-old pupil on the head with a ruler in class has been cleared of assault. Rina Khan, 41, was accused of hitting the child so hard that it broke - as a punishment for getting a question wrong during a Maths lesson. On Tuesday, she went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court charged with common assault and child cruelty. Prosecutors said she 'flipped' and lost her temper before lashing out and also claimed she called the boy a 'muppet'. The court heard a teaching assistant watched in horror as part of the ruler 'flew across the room' after the incident on March 20 which left the Year 2 pupil 'sad and scared'. Ms Khan wept in the dock as she told the court yesterday that she only 'tapped' the boy on the head because he was misbehaving by poking another pupil with a pencil. And after less than an hour of deliberating today, a jury agreed with her version of events and cleared of her of all charges. Recorder John Edwards told Ms Khan: 'You have been found not guilty on both counts. You are discharged and you are free to go.' Outside court, Ms Khan spoke of her relief following her ordeal which saw her suspended from her job and taking anti-depressants. She said: 'I am just very relieved that the word was not guilty. This has been going in since March. 'I was suspended and I have been ill at home since. I have been taking anti-depressants and I had become somewhat of a recluse. 'And all this just for tapping a child on the head with a ruler. 'I do feel like I have been picked on. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next.' The court heard how the teacher had warned the child twice about poking another pupil with a pencil at the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons. She admitted to striking him on the head with the ruler but said she only did so gently and the ruler may have broken because it was weak. Jurors were also told the boy 'barely reacted at all' and was not injured during the incident. Giving evidence, Ms Khan, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, said: 'I have a duty of care to all my pupils. A jury Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, agreed with Ms Khan's version of events and cleared her of common assault and child cruelty charges. 'The pencil was quite sharp. It was going to hurt the girl. She was really trying so hard to work. 'I had a ruler in my hand at that time...and simply tapped him on the head. 'The ruler broke. I was really really shocked by that. I don't think I used any force. It was just a tap. 'I did call him a muppet but I did not use that word on that day. 'I used that word with my children sometimes but as a term of affection, just like The Muppets Show with the furry, little guys.' Tom Walkling, defending, added: 'Do we want to live in a world where teachers are so afraid of being prosecuted in a criminal court that they are wary of any contact with the children in their care?

Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Options: A The colorchanging molecules are certain to be used outside the lab.

Check with your high school to see if there are any classes that might prove relevant to the field. At the very least, you should try to take a home economics course.. 2). Take full advantage of college placement exams, if you want to get a degree. If you do not have a high school diploma, find classes at your local community college.. 3). However, having a high school diploma is important in this situation because the more advanced you are in the field, the more significant your chosen career is going to be. You will need a high school diploma or any ged to become a tailor.. 4). Employment fields that require advanced education include science and social studies, business, and music. To apply for a degree, you typically must have at least one year of high school education..","completion":"1). Check with your high school to see if there are any classes that might prove relevant to the field. At the very least, you should try to take a home economics course. The correct answer is option 1. After earning a high school diploma, the next step would be to explore relevant courses available within your high school, such as home economics, art, or fashion classes. This allows you to gain some basic knowledge and skills related to tailoring. Option 2 is incorrect because college placement exams are specifically for students planning to attend college and earn a degree. While further education can be beneficial, it's not necessary to become a tailor. Option 3 repeats the importance of having a high school diploma or GED, which has already been established in the given context. It doesn't provide the next step to actually become a tailor. Option 4 is irrelevant as it mentions employment fields not related to tailoring and focuses on the general requirement of one year of high school education for applying to a degree program.

If you carry yourself with confidence, your fashion statement will be heard loud and clear. If you're uncomfortable in what you're wearing, it will show. After all, confidence is the best accessory one can wear. You can create a memorable trademark by accentuating the parts of your body or personality traits that you love about yourself. We all want to be remembered by something great, and creating your personal trademark is a great way to define yourself. For example, if you're quirky and outgoing, make bright and unique jewelry your trademark. If you love your naturally beautiful dark hair and tan skin, accentuate these features by making your trademark a deep red lip color.

Article: The old man fished alone in a small rowboat and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's patents had told him that the old man was now bad luck, and ordered the boy to join another boat, which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his boat empty and he always went down to help him carry in the fishing lines or take down the old, patched sail. \\"Santiago,\\" the boy said to him as they dragged up the boat to the sand. \\"I could go with you again. I've made some money.\\" the old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. \\"No,\\" the old man said. \\"You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them. You must obey your father.\\" \\"We can be lucky again too. Remember when we didn't catch a fish for 10 days, then caught a big one each day for a month?\\" said the boy. \\"Can I offer you a beer on the balcony and then we'll take the stuff home,\\" said the boy. \\"Why not?\\" the old man said. \\"Santiago,\\" the boy said as they sat on the balcony, \\"If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way.\\" \\"You bought me a beer,\\" the old man said, lifting the bottle to his mouth. \\"Do you remember the first time I took you out to fish?\\" the old man asked. \\"I was five. I remember the tail of a huge fish slapping against the boat, the noise of you clubbing him and the sweet blood smell. I remember everything from when we first went together,\\" the boy said. The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, loving eyes. \\"May I get some sardines for tomorrow? Let me get four fresh ones,\\" said the boy. \\"One,\\" the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening like a sea breeze. \\"Two,\\" the boy said. \\"Thank you,\\" the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained modesty. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride. \\"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this... Question: Why was the boy forced to stop working for the old man? Options: A: It was too dangerous to continue fishing. B: It was time for the boy to return to school. C: The old man was thought to be a poor teacher. D: The boy couldn't earn enough money with the old man. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: The boy's parents deemed the old man as bad luck because he had gone for an extended period without catching a fish. They believed that the boy couldn't earn enough money with the old man and therefore, directed him to join another boat that had better fishing success. The situation was not about the risk factor associated with fishing (option A), the boy's education (option B), or the old man's teaching skills (option C). The issue was purely about the perceived luck and profitability of fishing with the old man. The parents were assured about their decision when the new boat the boy worked on caught three good fish in the very first week. The scenario evidently touches upon superstitious beliefs and survival needs in a fisherman's life, with the driving decision-maker being his ability to catch fish and thereby, sustain livelihood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kevin Patrick Shields was born on 21 May 1963 in Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, United States. He is the eldest of five siblings born to Irish parents; his mother was a nurse and his father was an executive in the food industry. Shields' parents had emigrated to the United States from Ireland in the 1950s, when the couple were teenagers. Shields attended Christ the King, a Roman Catholic primary school which he described as \\"a really horrible school run by psychopathic nuns\\". In August 2007, reports emerged that My Bloody Valentine would reunite for the 2008 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, United States; this was later confirmed by Shields, along with the announcement that the band's third studio album (which he had begun recording in 1996) was near completion. In June 2008, My Bloody Valentine played two live rehearsals at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, their first public performances in 16 years. They began an extensive worldwide tour in summer 2008 (their first since their 1992 tour in support of Loveless) including appearances at Oyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Ireland, and the Fuji Rock Festival in Niigata, Japan. The band reportedly spent PS200,000 on equipment for their world tour. In October 2011, Shields launched the independent record label Pickpocket together with Le Volume Courbe frontwoman Charlotte Marionneau, and considered releasing a collaborative \\"ten minutes of noise\\" single on the imprint. In May 2012 remastered versions of Isn't Anything and Loveless were released as well as the EP's 1988-1991 collection, which featured the band's Shields-remastered Creation Records extended plays, singles and unreleased tracks. In November, Shields announced plans to release My Bloody Valentine's third album online before the end of the year, before announcing during a warm-up show at Electric Brixton in London on 27 January 2013 that the album \\"might be out in two or three days.\\" The m b v album was eventually released through the band's official website on 2 February 2013, crashing the site on its launch due to high traffic. According to Metacritic, m b v received \\"universal acclaim\\", and the band began a worldwide tour upon its release. Shields has since announced intentions to release remastered analogue cuts of My Bloody Valentine's back catalogue and a My Bloody Valentine EP \\"of all-new material\\", which will be followed by a fourth studio album.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Identify adjectives, adverbs, and expressions conveying emotions: \\"came back,\\" \\"tie,\\" \\"lost,\\" \\"at least,\\" \\"made a showing\\" 3. Assess the tone of those expressions: - \\"came back\\" and \\"tie\\" show determination and a comeback, suggesting a positive sentiment. - \\"lost\\" conveys a negative outcome. - \\"Hey, at least\\" denotes an attempt at finding a positive side despite the negative outcome, implying a mixed sentiment. - \\"made a showing\\" suggests pride and accomplishment, even though the outcome was not a complete success. 4. Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet by combining individual sentiments: The tweet is sharing the story of a sports team that, despite an initial struggle, managed to make a comeback but ultimately lost the game. However, the author is focusing on the positive aspects of their performance, indicating that they are proud of their team's effort. 5.

Question: suppose pouring water into the carafe happens, how will it affect coffee being poured out of the machine. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More effect. When pouring water into the carafe is the initial step of the coffee-making process, it directly impacts the subsequent stages that lead to coffee being poured out of the machine. The amount of water poured into the carafe determines the amount of coffee that will be produced, as well as potentially affecting the strength and flavor of the coffee. This can be considered a perturbation that influences the second effect mentioned, which is the coffee being poured out of the machine. When the carafe is filled with water, this water is then poured into the coffee machine, where it is heated to the optimal brewing temperature. As the water is heated, it is forced through the coffee grounds that have been placed in the filter. The hot water extracts the flavors and oils from the ground coffee beans, ultimately resulting in brewed coffee. This is when the amount of water in the carafe plays a crucial role in the result. If more water is used than usual, the final coffee output could be greater, potentially leading to a larger volume or weaker coffee overall, depending on the ratio of water to ground coffee and how long the brewing process takes. If less water is used, the amount of coffee produced may be smaller, possibly resulting in a stronger or more concentrated brew. It is essential to maintain the appropriate water-to-grounds ratio to yield the desired strength and flavor for the final product. Furthermore, adding a bit of salt to the coffee grounds can help to enhance flavor, as salt can suppress bitterness and enhance the natural sweetness of the coffee. When the water passes through the grounds and the added salt, the salt dissolves in the brewing process, subtly altering the flavor profile of the brewed coffee. In summary, pouring water into the carafe has a significant effect on the coffee being poured out of the machine, as it directly impacts the volume and flavor of the final product. The perturbation (i.e., the amount of water poured into the carafe) influences the second effect mentioned (the coffee being poured out of the machine) by either increasing or decreasing the output and potentially altering the coffee's taste and strength."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The neckline should be tasteful, but the sleeve length (if the dress has sleeves) is optional. Many full-length formal gowns are sleeveless. In the absence of a full floor-length dress, a very nice, dark colored or black three-quarters length dress may be acceptable. Older women should always choose a longer gown, but younger women may be able to wear a shorter gown appropriately. The most formal events call for a long ballgown with a full skirt. Black is usually preferred, with a rich texture that adds some visual interest. Deep colors like blue, maroon, a rich purple, and brown also look nice. White or red dresses can be formal and classy, but may make you stand out. Use caution when wearing these to events like weddings, at which the bride should stand out, not one of the guests. Put your regular day purse aside and opt for a satin, or beaded, smaller clutch or purse for a black tie event. The more sparkle, the better. This is a time for you to shine. Wear real jewelry (for example, real diamonds, pearls, or gold) whenever possible. Costume jewelry should look very real and not tacky if worn. Traditional jewelry recommendations are a sparkly bracelet and earrings or very simple, understated necklace. It can be difficult to wear evening wear in the winter months, as it is often chilly and women’s black tie attire rarely has sleeves to speak of. Your cold-weather options, however, should also be formal. Remember that you may be able to shop at a thrift store or borrow items instead of buying them new. A fur or faux fur coat or wrap is the preferred choice for black tie dress codes. A traditional overcoat is the second best choice. For milder climates or for time spent indoors, a shawl or wrap made from a quality material such as cashmere is preferred. Long gloves, while made for style rather than warmth, may help ward off the cold and will give you a fancy flair. None of your undergarments should be visible in any way while dressed in your evening wear. Check for bra straps. Most formal dresses will require a strapless bra. Be sure there are no panty lines. If your dress is curve-hugging or tight, you need to be sure that no one will be able to see your underwear. You may need to wear a thong or go without. Consider wearing slimming undergarments. There are undergarments that are meant to smooth out areas of your body that may be bumpy and help give you a flattering shape. These usually do not show any lines beneath the clothing. Evening shoes are usually dainty or strappy, with a decent heel. Large or clunky shoes do not generally look good with formal dresses. Evening shoes that are satin, beaded or shiny are great choices. Ideally, the texture and color of your shoes should match that of your handbag/clutch. You should spend extra time making your hair and makeup look nice for a black tie event. Traditional black tie formality calls for hair to be gathered in an up-do. Consider going to a salon to have a professional style your hair for you. Events that involve dancing often have more flexibility and encourage flowing hair. Arrange for a manicure and pedicure the day of the event. Make a reservation ahead of time to ensure that they will have room for you. Makeup should be applied well and not over-done. If you are inexperienced in makeup application, schedule a makeover at a salon or go to a makeup counter at a department store.

Answer based on context: Ben Roethlisberger threw an interception during their second play of overtime, handing the win to Dallas. With the overtime loss, the Steelers enabled the arch-rival Ravens (9-5) to secure their fifth consecutive playoff berth by dropping to 7-7 on the season, thus moving them down to third place in the AFC North with their playoff hopes in jeopardy. Pittsburgh also finished their regular season at 3-5 in road games after dropping to 0-2 at Cowboys Stadium (the other loss there was to the Packers in Super Bowl XLV). The Steelers hope to rebound at home against the second-place Bengals (8-6) next week in what is a must-win game for both AFC North rivals, as only one of them will be able to join Baltimore in the playoffs, unless the Indianapolis Colts lose their final two games or the Miami Dolphins lose at least one of their final two games.

Instead, it provides information about the end of Carnival festivities on Ash Wednesday and the burial of the sardine tradition in Spain. Fat Thursday, also known as \\"Tłusty Czwartek\\" in Poland or \\"Giovedì Grasso\\" in Italy, is a Christian feast day that takes place during Carnival season, marking the last Thursday before Lent. It is a day on which people indulge themselves in sweets and various hearty foods, particularly pastries fried in oil, as a form of celebrating before the fasting period of Lent. In Poland, Fat Thursday is celebrated with various traditional pastries such as pączki (Polish donuts) and faworki (also known as angel wings). The custom is to eat as many sweets as possible on this day, as it is believed that those who do not will experience bad luck throughout the year. In Italy, the day is marked by parades, parties, and eating various rich and fatty foods, as it is the last feast day before the 40-day Lenten fast. Although Fat Thursday is a pre-Lenten celebration, it differs in date from other similar occasions such as Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) or Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day), which is more widely celebrated in Anglo-Saxon countries. The main similarity among these celebrations is that they all occur shortly before the solemn period of fasting and penance during Lent, allowing people to indulge in rich and satisfying foods before abstaining for a religious purpose."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Make this proper case.","completion":"If you are elderly or have fragile skin, it is important to try and prevent a skin tear from occurring. Skin tears are common in older adults, and people with fragile skin may be more susceptible to these injuries. Prevention is crucial as it can lead to reduced pain, discomfort and risk of infections. Here are some detailed tips to help prevent skin tears in such individuals: 1. Maintain proper skin hydration: Dry skin is more prone to tears. Use gentle moisturizers daily, preferably after bathing, to keep your skin soft and supple. Avoid hot water as it can strip away the skin's natural oils. 2. Use gentle skin cleansers: Harsh soaps and body washes can further lead to dryness and irritation. Opt for mild, fragrance-free, and hydrating cleansers when bathing. 3. Wear protective clothing: Choose clothes that provide a barrier between your skin and potential hazards. Select garments that are made of soft materials with long sleeves and pant legs to provide optimum coverage. 4. Avoid tight clothing or accessories: Compression stockings, tight socks, and other constricting items can cause friction on the skin and contribute to tearing. Make sure to wear clothing that is comfortable and fits well without causing excessive pressure. 5. Wear padded protectors: Utilize cushioned arm and leg protectors that distribute pressure evenly and reduce friction against your fragile skin. 6. Keep your environment safe: Ensure that your surroundings are free of clutter and have proper lighting to reduce the likelihood of tripping and falling. Install grab bars or handrails in high-risk areas such as bathrooms or staircases. 7. Maintain a balanced diet: Consume foods that promote skin health, including those rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as protein and omega-3 fatty acids. 8. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water keeps the skin hydrated from within and helps maintain skin elasticity, thus reducing the likelihood of skin tears. 9. Regular skincare routine: Incorporate a daily skincare routine to cleanse, moisturize, and assess your skin for any signs of damage, irritation, or potential issues. 10. Be gentle when handling the skin: Be cautious during daily activities, such as getting dressed, applying lotion, or handling objects, to minimize the risk of skin tears. 11. Consult with a healthcare professional: If you are concerned about the fragility of your skin or are experiencing recurrent skin tears, consult with a healthcare professional. They can provide additional guidance and recommendations tailored to your specific needs. Remember, prevention is the key to minimizing the risk of skin tears amongst elderly individuals or those with fragile skin. Implement these measures to promote healthier skin and reduce the chances of injuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose anger and frustration over his marriage can be evidenced in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904? ? While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie.

Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a \\"need to start preparing for transition\\" for Myanmar. \\"We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,\\" he said.

The reviewer claims it to be \\"THE song of 2007\\" and seems to be genuinely impacted by the track, even mentioning that it left them \\"speechless.\\" It's clear that this reviewer is passionate about the song and holds it in high regard. Furthermore, considering the reviewer's passion and knowledge about Snow Patrol, it could be inferred that they are somewhat of a fan and have a strong affinity for the band as a whole. In this case, their opinion may carry more weight to others, since they are familiar with the band's previous works and are excited about the new album. In conclusion, this product review is undeniably positive due to the enthusiastic tone, strong defense of the album against negative claims, and the profound admiration for the featured song. The review shows that the writer is an ardent fan of Snow Patrol and highly recommends the album to others, which will likely persuade others to give the album a listen and potentially increase its popularity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a likelihood that the Japanese yen would rise in value. In the wake of this event, Japanese Government adjusted the price of Japanese Currency Yen in accordance with the going market price. On the other hand, at he same time, UK was having economic downturn. There was a likelihood that the UK Currency Pound Sterling would go down. Fearing public backlash, UK Government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which currency would most likely be exchanged in the black market, Pound Sterling or Yen? Hint: Often, foreign exchange controls can result in the creation of black markets to exchange the weaker currency for stronger currencies. This leads to a situation where the exchange rate for the foreign currency is much higher than the rate set by the government, and therefore creates a shadow currency exchange market. As such, it is unclear whether governments have the ability to enact effective exchange controls.[1] Answer:","completion":"Given the information in the paragraph, the currency that would most likely be exchanged in the black market is the Pound Sterling because the UK government kept the price of the Pound Sterling at the same level despite facing an economic downturn.

Question: Lee quickly began running towards the school entrance. Given the context: How would you describe Lee? Possible answers: running to avoid someone, in a hurry, running to finish a exam Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, we can interpret that Lee is likely in a hurry. The statement \\"Lee quickly began running towards the school entrance\\" suggests that there is some degree of urgency in their actions. While the alternatives 'running to avoid someone' and 'running to finish an exam' are also valid possibilities, they are more situation-specific and require additional context to support them. Given the limited information, the description of Lee as \\"in a hurry\\" is the most reasonable general assumption we can make. Lee's swift actions and direction towards the school entrance indicate that they have an important reason to be there, and are motivated to arrive quickly. It's important to note that the context provided doesn't contain enough information to be absolutely certain about the reason behind Lee's hurried actions. Nonetheless, we can infer that something significant is happening at the school, and Lee is eager to actively participate or address the situation.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes literally \\"Protection Squadron\\") was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in Nazi Germany. It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe. - Joachim Peiper ( German pronunciation : ( joaxm pap ) ; 30 January 1915 -- 14 July 1976 ) , also known as Jochen Peiper , was a field officer in the Waffen - SS during World War II and personal adjutant to Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler between November 1940 and August 1941 . Peiper fought on both the Eastern Front against the Red Army and the Western Front against the Western Allies , and he won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for extreme battlefield bravery and outstanding military leadership . By 1945 , he was an SS - Standartenführer and the Waffen - SS 's youngest regimental colonel . Peiper was convicted of war crimes committed in Belgium and imprisoned for almost 12 years . He was accused of war crimes in Italy , but Italian and German courts concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution . After his release from prison , Peiper worked for both Porsche and Volkswagen , before moving to France , where he translated books from English to German under the nom de plume Rainer Buschmann . Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976 , when he was shot by unknown assailants who then burned his house to the ground using Molotov cocktails . - Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. In some armies, including most English-speaking ones, it is an officer who assists a more senior officer, while in other armies, especially Francophone ones, it is an NCO (non-commissioned officer), normally corresponding roughly to a staff sergeant or warrant officer. - Reichsführer-SS was a special title and rank that existed between the years of 1925 and 1945 for the commander of the Schutzstaffel (SS). \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was a title from 1925 to 1933, and from 1934 to 1945 it was the highest rank of the SS. The longest serving and by far most noteworthy \\"Reichsführer-SS\\" was Heinrich Himmler. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (\\"Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Sergeant (abbreviated to Sgt and capitalised when used as a named person's title) is a rank in many uniformed organizations, principally military and policing forces. Its origin is the Latin \\"serviens\\", \\"one who serves\\", through the French term \\"sergent\\". - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - The Waffen-SS (Armed SS) was the armed wing of the Nazi Party's SS organisation. Its formations included men from Nazi Germany, along with volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. - Heinrich Luitpold Himmler (7 October 1900 23 May 1945) was \\"Reichsführer\\" of the \\"Schutzstaffel\\" (Protection Squadron; SS), and a leading member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) of Nazi Germany. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement (Home) Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich (\\"Generalbevollmächtigter für die Verwaltung\\"). Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

Another 12 veterans received their medals from French ambassador Sylvie Bermann at a ceremony in London. One of the recipients, Peter Cliffe, 94, from Woking, Surrey, landed at Leon-Sur-Mer in Normandy on 6 June.

Article: Even if you are no longer being abused or assaulted, it is possible for you to still be experiencing lingering physiological effects of trauma from the abuse. This trauma is comparable to PTSD. Flashbacks from the experience, along with intense fear and panic, can arise unexpectedly during your day-to-day life. Often the scars remain years after the abuse has stopped, and many people go to counselors to seek further help in overcoming the effects of their past. A mental health counselor or therapist can lend you a supportive ear and provide various techniques to help you overcome the effects of any trauma that you might be holding on to. Domestic violence organizations often have counseling services to help victims of domestic violence situations and sexual assault. One of the most important steps to recognizing and escaping the clutches of sexual abuse is to realize that it is not your fault that you are or were being abused. Guilt or shame will sometimes arise, either as a result of the perpetrator's actions or from the way you are treated by people you tell, but it’s important not to allow this to keep you from telling other people and getting help for yourself. It’s important to know that being assaulted or abused by another person is never your fault. Abusers choose to abuse other people. No matter how vulnerable or foolish you might have been, they chose to take advantage of you. Abusers can play mind games. They might convince you of things that are wrong, and make you believe that you are undeserving of love and care. After an assault or ongoing abuse, it may take a while before you are feeling like yourself again. During this time you may feel frustrated, but it is important that you do not take out your frustration on yourself. Accept that you will need time to recover and that it will be a challenging process. Imagine if a friend was going through the same thing. Think of the time it would take them to recover, and what you would say to them. Try to extend this empathy to yourself. Something horrible happened to you, so of course you are going to have difficult feelings about it. Let yourself be upset. Allow yourself to experience anger, sadness, confusion, and all kinds of emotions. This is a normal part of the healing process. Look for the people who are most important in your life, the ones who lift your spirits and make you feel relaxed. Pick up the phone or go to the kitchen and spend time with them. The support of others will help you heal. One way that you can begin to express your frustrations about what happened to you is to write about them. Start keeping a journal where you write a little bit each day. Write about whatever is on your mind. Some people even benefit from describing the abuse they endured. As you heal, you will need to keep talking to people who care and understand. Try joining a support group for survivors of sexual abuse to connect with people who understand what you are going through. These support groups can provide a safe place to talk about your experience and hear what other people have been through, which may help you realize that you are not alone. It is common to experience feelings that you are not in control or to have difficulty making decisions. The best thing that you can do to regain some control over your life is to start making decisions about your recovery and your future. Gather as much information as you can about your situation and make decisions about how you want to respond. If you are pressing charges for rape or domestic abuse, choose a lawyer to help you navigate the legal matters. If you have an STI or injuries, choose a doctor that can help you find treatment. For emotional recovery, choose a counselor to help you work through it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the lingering physiological effects of trauma from abuse or assault, which can be similar to PTSD.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber.

The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - In computing and optical disc recording technologies, an optical disc (OD) is a flat, usually circular disc which encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits (binary value of 0 or off, due to lack of reflection when read) and lands (binary value of 1 or on, due to a reflection when read) on a special material (often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces. The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

Please answer the following question: People in South Korea who feel they can no longer bear the stress of everyday life now can choose to stay in a prison to relax and think deeply. In a society where pressure to do well in school and find highly-paid jobs is intense, a former lawyer came up with an extreme relaxation idea. Kwon Yong-seok created the \\"Prison Inside Me\\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells . Located on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \\"Prison Inside Me\\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \\"healing reasons,\\" but his request was turned down. \\"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\\" he said. \\"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won (19 million). The facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \\"inner prison\\" to find inner peace. According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \\"Prison Inside Me\\" costs 150,000 won (146). Mr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \\"relaxation center,\\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days.

Here is a question about this article: The 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play (EP), which achieved up to 10–15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players. LP albums could be purchased 1 EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with 3 EPs or 12 items. The large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45 rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45 rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959. The EP lasted considerably longer in Europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as Serge Gainsbourg and the Beatles.

However, as much as the app has potential, there are a few key areas where it could use improvement. Firstly, compatibility with certain games is hit-or-miss; some work seamlessly, while others either crash or exhibit significant bugs that impact gameplay. It would be great to see a more extensive and regularly updated compatibility list that keeps users informed. Secondly, the user interface is quite outdated and could use a visual overhaul. Navigation can be a bit confusing at times, with settings and options hidden away in not-so-intuitive locations. A more streamlined and modern UI would significantly enhance the overall user experience. Lastly, the app's performance is also inconsistent across different devices.

Answer the following question: Question: what is the difference between multistage and cluster sampling I found the following answer on Google: Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, your found answer provides a basic definition of cluster sampling, but it only touches the surface of the concept and doesn't completely address the differences between multistage and cluster sampling. To give you a more comprehensive understanding, let me provide a detailed comparison between the two sampling techniques. Multistage sampling and cluster sampling are both probability sampling techniques that are employed when studying large and complex populations. They are designed to make the sampling process more efficient and manageable. Cluster Sampling: Cluster sampling is a technique used when \\"natural\\" but relatively homogeneous groupings are evident in a statistical population. In this method, the entire population is divided into separate clusters, usually based on some shared characteristic or geographical proximity. The clusters should be more or less representative of the population. Then, a random sample of these clusters is selected for the study. All the elements within the chosen clusters are included in the sample. For instance, if a researcher wants to study the academic performance of high school students in a large city, they may divide the population into clusters based on individual schools. Then, a random sample of schools is selected, and data is collected from all students in those chosen schools. Advantages of cluster sampling include reduced travel and administrative costs and easier implementation compared to simple random sampling. Multistage Sampling: Multistage sampling is an extension of cluster sampling and involves multiple stages of sampling within the selected clusters. In this technique, the population is first divided into clusters, and then, instead of selecting all elements in the chosen clusters, further random samples are drawn from within each selected cluster at different stages. This process can be carried out in multiple stages, depending on the desired sample size and level of detail. Continuing with the previous high school academic performance example, in a multistage sampling design, the researcher might first choose a set of schools (clusters). Then, within each selected school, a random set of classrooms or specific grades might be chosen. Following this, a random sample of students from within the selected classrooms or grades may be taken. This multi-step approach reduces the overall sample size while still maintaining a fair representation of the population. Multistage sampling can increase the overall efficiency and accuracy of research findings while reducing the sample size and logistical challenges. In summary, the main difference between multistage and cluster sampling lies in the additional stages of sampling within the clusters for multistage sampling. While both techniques involve breaking the population into clusters, cluster sampling includes all elements within the chosen clusters, whereas multistage sampling involves multiple stages of random sampling within those selected clusters to obtain the final sample. Each technique has its advantages and can be applied depending on the nature of the study, the required level of accuracy, and the available resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what groups research shows that new models are needed Context: Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.

If you were flipping around your television dial on Election Night, you saw a lot of news coverage dominated by anchors and pundits sitting in TV studios spouting opinion and analysis. But not on CNN. On our air, you saw dozens of reporters at polling places around the country, watching for irregularities but also capturing the messy yet miraculous spectacle of democracy in action. You saw Candy Crowley, Jessica Yellin, Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar at election night headquarters, offering behind the scenes details about the candidates and campaigns as they anxiously awaited the verdict of the people. You saw Dana Bash dissecting the Senate and House outcomes as only someone can who has covered Congress for two decades. And you saw the maestro of the Magic Wall, John King, interpreting the tallies from decisive counties within the swing states minute by minute as they came in, telling you what they meant and how they would shape the electoral map. A lot has been written about how cable news has become increasingly dominated by talk and opinion, because that's what drives TV ratings. But as we began our planning for Election Night more than a year ago, CNN decided to go in the opposite direction and double down on our strength: reporting. We pared back on the number of analysts in our studio and sent more reporters into the field. We invested in new state-of-the-art sets in our Washington bureau that allowed us to display electoral data more clearly and vividly than we ever had before. We relied on two anchors, Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, who have always been more interested in conducting great correspondents than being soloists themselves. We asked our incomparable international reporters to keep track of what the rest of the world was saying about America's voteâ€”and we actually put them on our U.S. airwaves to talk about it. We did it because we value facts more than opinions, but also because these days that's what sets CNN apart. And we were glad to see that, for this historical night at least, it was what the public appeared to crave as well. An average of more than 8.8 million viewers watched the evening's coverage on our U.S. network, more than any other cable news network, and others followed it on CNN's international networks around the world. The reviews are also in, and they tell us that our investment in covering the election as journalists was welcomed. \\"CNN Destroys Cable Competition on Election Night,\\" was only one gratifying headline, on a post by Erik Wemple, the media critic for The Washington Post. At CNN.com, we had more than 203 million page views, the highest in four years. Our social media traffic on Twitter, Facebook and other sharing platforms set new records. But at CNN we're not ones to dwell over press clippings, good or bad, and so we are already hard at work following up on all the angles that emerged from last night's result. Can the parties now come together to address jobs, the deficit, immigration, the environment, relations with Iran and China and all the other pressing problems clouding our future? Or is a 6 billion election that left us with the same division of executive and legislative power we had before a recipe for more gridlock? And what will the demographic winds that carried Barack Obama to reelection, despite a sour economy, mean for tomorrow? How will our future be shaped by a Hispanic population that now accounts for more than 1 in 10 voters, by the empowerment of a generation of young voters who have now turned out in record numbers for two presidential cycles in a row (and who are driving a slow but steady sea change in acceptance of gay rights), by a white electorate that favored Mitt Romney, but is smaller than it has ever been, by the growing political gap between women, who favored Obama by 11 points, and men, who went for Romney by 7 points? And what are we to make of not only the persistent red/blue divide between states, but the growing urban/suburban/rural divisions within states?

The exerted pressure inside the extinguisher pushes out a substance which can suppress the fire, usually a foam or powder. The discharged substance will aim to cool the burning fuel (thus removing the heat), to remove the supply of oxygen (so the fire cannot continue to burn) or to inhibit the chemical reaction making the fire. Different types of fire extinguishers offer different substances, for example, for a common class A fire (caused by solid materials such as wood or paper), water is usually used to cool the burning material and hence extinguish the fire.

The scarcity of people and goods crossing the border is a striking change from what was previously a hub of activity amid the vast, uninviting terrain. Culprits behind the Decline Various factors have contributed to the dwindling of two-way traffic between Jordan and Iraq. Key causes include: 1. Escalating security concerns: The emergence of extremist groups like ISIS in the region has led to widespread instability, spreading fear amongst individuals and businesses. The resulting militant clashes have rendered the borders unsafe and heavily militarized, discouraging people from traveling across the boundary. 2. Economic downturn: The ongoing economic slowdown in both Jordan and Iraq, coupled with lower oil prices, has diminished the incentive for trade between the two countries. Moreover, global sanctions imposed on Iraq have further stifled the nation's ability to engage in cross-border commercial activity. 3. The refugee crisis: The influx of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria has put immense strain on Jordan's resources, leading the nation to enforce stricter border control measures to manage the situation. Impact on Local Communities The decrease in border traffic has left local communities on both sides of the boundary struggling to adapt. Many families who once relied on cross-border trade or tourism for their livelihood now find their businesses faltering. The lack of economic opportunities has led to increased unemployment, financial hardship, and even forced migration for some communities. Looking Forward Addressing the issues that have led to the deteriorating state of the Jordan-Iraq border is paramount for the future growth and stability of the region. Fostering a more secure environment by addressing extremist threats and regional instability is critical for restoring confidence in border crossings. Additionally, stimulating economic growth and lifting trade restrictions can help revive the moribund commercial activities between the two countries. Conclusion Jordan's bleak, windswept border with Iraq may currently be experiencing a low point in two-way traffic, but there is hope for improvement in the future. By tackling the security, economic, and humanitarian challenges present in the region, it is possible to rekindle the sense of vibrancy and cooperation that once existed between the two neighbors. Only by addressing these issues can the local communities rebuild and thrive again on both sides of the border."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1638, King Louis XIII of France is delighted when his wife bears him a son, Louis, the heir to the throne. However, a few minutes later, a second son is born. Colbert (Walter Kingsford), the king's trusted adviser, persuades the king to secretly send the second child, Philippe, away to Gascony to be raised by his majesty's dear friend, d'Artagnan (Warren William), in order to avert a possible civil war later. Fouquet (Joseph Schildkraut), a mere cardinal's messenger at the time, finds out about the twin and uses this to advance his career. Twenty years later, he is the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. The king is hated by the commoners for levying oppressive taxes and for executioning them for not paying them. Fouquet sends soldiers to force d'Artagnan and his people to pay the taxes, though the old king had exempted him and his village from them. They are driven off, but return in much greater numbers and, with great difficulty, capture d'Artagnan, the three musketeers and Philippe. Louis is about to order their executions when Colbert tells him about Philippe's uncanny resemblance to him. As Louis is aware of an assassination attempt to take place that day (but not where or when), he makes Philippe impersonate him in exchange for his friends' lives. Philippe not only survives the ambush, he shows mercy to his would-be killers and is cheered by the people. Princess Maria Theresa (Joan Bennett), whom Louis is to wed to seal an alliance with Spain, finds this new Louis much more attractive than the real one. However, when she discovers that Louis is having an affair with Mademoiselle de la Valliere (Marion Martin), she returns to Spain. When the truth is discovered, Louis has Philippe imprisoned with an iron mask placed on his head, hoping that Philippe's beard will grow inside the mask and eventually suffocate him. Philippe is rescued by the musketeers, who break into the sleeping Louis's chamber and imprison him in the mask. The musketeers drag him away and lock him in the Bastille, where the jailers... The answer is:","completion":"What challenges does Philippe face as he impersonates King Louis XIV, and how do his actions affect Princess Maria Theresa's perception of him?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paddy cares for the small children and forbids them by \\"law\\" from going to the other side of the island, as he had found remains from bloody human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating a scarlet berry which is apparently deadly. (He calls it the \\"never-wake-up berry\\".)

Years pass and they both grow into tall, strong, and beautiful teenagers. They live in their hut, spending their days together fishing, swimming, and diving for pearls. Richard and Emmeline (now portrayed by Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields) begin to fall in love, although this is emotionally stressful for them because of their lack of education on human sexuality. Emmeline is frightened after she begins her first menstrual period; confused about it, she refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a cut. Sometime later, their relationship suffers a major blow when a ship appears for the first time in years.

We have to find the value of \\"z\\" in this equation: 236*z - 588*z - 16086 = 496*z - 82*z First, let's add up the \\"z\\" terms on each side of the equation (these are the numbers with the letter \\"z\\" next to them). On the left side, we have: 236*z - 588*z = (236 - 588)*z = -352*z On the right side, we have: 496*z - 82*z = (496 - 82)*z = 414*z Now, our equation looks like this: -352*z - 16086 = 414*z Next, we want to move all the \\"z\\" terms to one side of the equation and all the number terms to the other side. To do that, we'll add 352*z to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -352*z on the left side: -352*z + 352*z - 16086 = 414*z + 352*z This simplifies to: -16086 = 766*z Now, we want to isolate the \\"z\\" by itself. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 766: -16086 / 766 = 766*z / 766 After dividing, we get: z = -21 So, the value of \\"z\\" in this equation is -21.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If there is no food stuck in the jets, this would result in an efficient and unhindered spraying process, and, consequently, the soapy water will be more effectively sprayed on the dishes. The supposed perturbation enhances the efficiency of the water jets which in turn increases the effectiveness of the cleaning process. This improvement has a positive influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the shooting of water through the jets to clean the dishes. Since there is no blockage due to food particles, the water jets can effectively spray the soapy water onto the entirety of the dishes. This allows for a more thorough cleaning, effectively reaching all corners and edges of the dishes, and ensuring the removal of any grime, dirt, or residual food particles. As a result, the overall dishwashing capabilities are enhanced as the dishwasher can not only clean more efficiently but also potentially minimize the need for a manual pre-wash or post-wash intervention. So, in conclusion, having no food stuck in the jets results in a more effective spraying of soapy water on the dishes, positively influencing the cleaning process and reducing the likelihood of residue or leftover dirt on the dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Who is the sister of the woman that the flight sergeant asks to marry him? from the following article ? Celia Crowson and her family go on holiday to the south coast of England in the summer of 1939. Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake. Their relationship encounters a crisis when Fred refuses to tell Celia when he is sent out on his first mission, but soon afterwards they meet and make up, with Fred asking Celia to marry him.

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet).

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Francis \\"Frank\\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (nee Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes. By age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. In 1913, the first election for the city commission saw 91 men on the ballot competing for five available seats on the commission. Hague finished fourth with 17,390 votes and was elected to the first City Commission of Jersey City. The only Wittpenn-supported candidate, A. Harry Moore, was also elected. As a result of having garnered the most votes (21,419) former mayor Fagan became the first mayor under this new form of government, and the only Republican to hold that title in Jersey City for the following 75 years. Hague was named public safety commissioner, with control over the police and fire departments. In the same year, Hague cemented his control of the Hudson County political machine by securing for himself the leadership of the Hudson County Democratic Organization Executive Committee. Hague immediately set about reshaping the corrupt Jersey City police force with tough Horsehoe recruits. Hague spearheaded crackdowns on prostitution and narcotics trafficking, earning him favor with religious leaders. These enforcement acts went as far as Hague himself marching across local Vaudeville stages personally directing the shut down of \\"girlie shows.\\" At the heart of this change was an inner cadre of officers known as the Zeppelin Squad or \\"zepps\\" who were personally loyal to Hague alone. The \\"zepps\\" would spy on, and report back to Hague about other members of the department. Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city's once-astronomical crime rate. Hague took steps to curb the police department's lackadaisical work ethic, punishing offenses that had gone unpunished for years. He also made much-needed improvements to the fire department; at the time he took office Jersey City's fire insurance rates were among the highest in the nation. Upon discovering in early 1916 that millions of pounds of munitions were being stockpiled on the Jersey City waterfront, Hague travelled to Washington, D.C. to register concerns for the safety of his constituents. His meetings with Congressmen resulted in no action, Congress having decided that Jersey City was an \\"appropriate port.\\" Hague's concerns were shown to be valid in July 1916 when the Black Tom explosion sent shrapnel flying across the city. In 1917, Hague, with his reputation as the man who cleaned up the police force, ran for reelection. He put together a commission ticket called \\"The Unbossed.\\" The ticket consisted of him, Parks Commissioner Moore, Revenue Commissioner George Brensinger, ex-judge Charles F.X. O'Brien and City Clerk Michael I. Fagan. It swept all five spots on the commission. Moore topped the poll, and traditional practice called for him to be appointed mayor. However, when the commission met for the first time on May 11, Hague was chosen as the new mayor. When did Hague become a commissioner?","completion":"Hague became a commissioner in 1913 when he finished fourth with 17,390 votes in the first election for the city commission of Jersey City.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who collaborated with Ono on Some Time? ? Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \\"strategic counter-measure\\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \\"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\\". In the US, \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \\"nigger\\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Her song \\"Death of Samantha\\" was inspired by the incident.

Question: Who is the current governor of the state where Jones was born? Passage:Walter \\"Wiley\\" Jones was born in Madison County in northeastern Georgia, on July 14, 1848. His parents were George Jones, a white planter, and Jones' slave, Anne, who had six children by George Jones: Matthew (who superintended the construction of the Wiley Jones Street Car Line), Thomas, Julia (wife of Ben Reed), Wiley, Taylor, and James (who managed many of Wiley's businesses). Wiley received his nickname because of his mischievous nature. At the age of five, he moved to Arkansas with his master and more than forty fellow slaves. They settled on the Governor Byrd plantation. George Jones died in 1858. Anne was called his wife in an 1889 biography of Jones, and she believed that George had promised to free herself and her children upon his death, but no manumission papers were found, and the family was kept as slaves and sold by the estate administer, Peter Finerty, to James Yell, a lawyer and planter in Pine Bluff. Jones worked as a houseboy and carriage driver for his new master. When Jones was ten, he was given to Yell's only son, Fountain Pitts Yell, on the occasion of Pitts Yell's marriage. Pitts was a state representative from 1860 to 1861. During the American Civil War, James Yell became a Major General of the Arkansas State Militia, and Pitts became a colonel in Company S of the 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment in the Confederate Army. James Yell's was transferred to the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1861, and James left the service and moved to Texas. Jones served for Pitts during the war until Pitts' death in 1864 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill in Louisiana. Jones then joined James Yell and his family in Waco, Texas. There, he served as a porter in a mercantile house for one year. He was then hired to drive a wagon carrying cotton on a route along the Brazos River to San Antonio. Links: a. Texas b.

It is presented with two values: 1. Without battery recharging: When the module is not recharging a battery, the consumption in the idle state is 10 milliamperes (mA). This indicates that the module requires minimal power to maintain its functionality without draining too much energy when it is not in active use. 2. With battery recharging: When the module is also recharging a battery, the consumption in the idle state increases to 60 milliamperes (mA). This increased consumption is due to the additional power required to recharge the battery while maintaining basic functionality of the module. It is important to note that energy consumption will likely be much higher when the module is actively being used and recharging a battery simultaneously. In summary, the module has different consumption levels in its idle state depending on whether it is recharging a battery or not.

When asked about Phillips' imitation of his style, Dave Matthews said: \\"More power to him, I don't mind,\\" and added \\"He should kick my ass, [then] maybe I can retire and he can take over my band.\\" Mentor Stevie Nicks said Phillips would have been good enough to join Fleetwood Mac back in 1975, after his performance of Jonny Lang's Still Rainin, which he received a standing ovation from the judges.

Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?, Options: - better communication - overthinking - frustration - misunderstandings - headaches The answer is \\"frustration\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"frustration\\" because learning languages is indeed a complex and challenging task, one that requires time, patience, and perseverance. Even in a full immersion environment where learners are constantly exposed to the target language, mistakes are inevitable, given the intricate nature of languages and the learning curve associated with their acquisition. When making mistakes while learning a language, there is always the possibility that these errors will lead to misinterpretation. These misunderstandings could range from minor inaccuracies to significant miscommunication, ultimately causing the individual to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. This discomfort, in turn, has the potential to generate frustration. The feeling of frustration arises due to the gap between one's expectations and reality. In the context of language learning, individuals may feel overwhelmed and disheartened by the difficulties they encounter while trying to express themselves accurately or understand others in a foreign language, particularly when they have committed considerable time and effort to overcoming these challenges. Moreover, the frustration may be further exacerbated when it impacts an individual's confidence levels in social settings or professional environments. They may feel inadequate when they cannot communicate effectively or comprehend others, feeling excluded from conversations or even hindered in their career progression. It is important to note, however, that frustration is a natural and common part of the language learning process. By acknowledging and addressing it constructively, language learners can turn frustration into motivation and resilience. They can utilize the experience of making mistakes to identify areas of improvement, seek feedback, and engage in more focused practice. In contrast, the other options provided in the original question - better communication, overthinking, misunderstandings, and headaches - do not accurately capture the emotional consequences that stem from the discomfort caused by making mistakes in a full immersion language learning environment. Better communication, while a goal of language learning, is an outcome that can be hindered by mistakes and misinterpretation rather than being a direct consequence of them. Overthinking might be related to the learning process, but it is not the primary emotional outcome of experiencing mistakes and misunderstanding. Misunderstandings are the result of errors and misinterpretation, but they are not an emotional consequence by themselves. Lastly, headaches might occur as a physical manifestation of stress experienced during language learning, but they are not specific enough to be considered the primary emotional response to the mentioned situation. In conclusion, \\"frustration\\" is indeed the most suitable answer, as it accurately reflects the emotional impact of making mistakes and facing misinterpretations while learning a language in a full immersion environment. Despite this, it is crucial for individuals to harness this frustration and turn it into a driving force for improvement, continually working on their language skills and developing strategies to overcome the challenges associated with language acquisition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is more like a photo album of \\"artistic\\" book designs, but they are too artistic to be really used as a binding for a book you'd actually like to read.The designs presented can be used to create decorative book objects, that's if you manage to get how to do it, as the instructions are very scarce.I also have Hand Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction (Paperback) by Aldren A. Watson, and this one I can recommend, it's very instructive. A:","completion":"The customer appears to be dissatisfied with the product, as evidenced by several key points in their review. First, the title of the review, \\"Wasted money,\\" expresses a strong negative sentiment regarding the value they received from their purchase. This immediately implies dissatisfaction with the product. Second, the customer notes that the book \\"is not the one that will teach you how to bind a book,\\" which suggests that it failed to meet their expectations. Instead, it consists of \\"artistic\\" book designs that the customer finds impractical for everyday use. This further emphasizes their disappointment with the product, as it does not align with their intended purpose of learning bookbinding. Furthermore, the customer comments on the insufficient instructions provided in the book, stating that they \\"can be used to create decorative book objects\\" only if the reader can decipher how to do so from the \\"scarce\\" information available. This lack of clarity and guidance adds to their overall disappointment and dissatisfaction with the product. Lastly, the customer directly compares the book to another bookbinding manual, \\"Hand Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction\\" by Aldren A. Watson. They explicitly recommend this other book, highlighting its instructional nature, as opposed to the reviewed book. This comparison serves to underscore their dissatisfaction with the original product, as they found the alternative more valuable and practical for their needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B? Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, momentum is conserved in elastic collisions which occur among gas particles. Since sample A contains gas particles, we can assume that collisions in sample A are elastic and conserve momentum. On the other hand, sample B does not contain gas particles, so it is more likely that collisions within sample B may not be elastic and therefore may not conserve momentum. So, the momentum would not be conserved in sample B."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

By coincidence hitmen are also there to kill Arthur Herk, who has secretly embezzled money from his company. When the fake assassination attempt crosses paths with the real one, police officers Monica and Walter are called out to the resulting disturbance. Eliot Arnold, Matt's father, who was contacted by Matt's friend, Andrew, immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk (Jenny's mother), as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herks' Mexican housemaid Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen.Realizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers, for a weapon, but ends up with suitcase nuclear bomb. Escaped convicts Snake and Eddie, who were previously kicked out of a bar called the Jolly Jackal for disorderly conduct, hold up the bar and kidnap Arthur and Puggy (who is an employee there) for the suitcase, not knowing its contents.Meanwhile, Matt tries to \\"kill\\" Jenny in a mall parking lot, but a security guard thinks that Matt's gun is real.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process would be the bat's brain interpreting the information received from the echoes to determine the location, distance, shape, and size of the object, which further helps the bat to navigate, avoid obstacles, and locate food sources in its environment. This entire process is known as echolocation. In more detail, the bat's brain processes the sound waves it receives by analyzing the difference in time between the emission of the call and the arrival of the echo, as well as the frequency shift and intensity variation of the echo. This enables the bat to estimate the distance, velocity, and direction of the nearby object. For example, if the echo takes a longer time to return or has lower intensity, it indicates that the object is further away, whereas a shorter time and higher intensity suggest a closer proximity. Moreover, the bat's brain can also compare the input from both ears to triangulate the precise location of the object, taking advantage of the differences in the arrival time and intensity of the echoes at each ear. If the echo arrives earlier in one ear, the object is more likely to be in that direction. Bats can also identify the texture and shape of the object based on the composition, pattern, and distribution of the returning echoes. Objects with different shapes, sizes, or surfaces will produce unique echo signatures that can help the bat recognize the nature of these objects, be it a nearby tree, an insect, or a predator. In summary, the last step of the echolocation process is the brain's interpretation of the information received from the echoes to accurately perceive and navigate the bat's surroundings, avoid obstacles, and locate food sources. This demonstrates the remarkable adaptation and capability of bats in their quest for survival in a diverse range of environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But, not for very long! My apologies as I need to give a little back story first. Please bear with. I first came to the DC/NOVA area via the US Army. It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay. Now, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included. She even had hired help that distributed Party Bags/Swag Bags that included cologne/perfume for the kids. I don't think my jaw closed the entire time we were there. This was for a FIVE year old!

Question: Is not necessarily worth two of anything, anywhere else. But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all. So with dead, smelly fish in mind, I persuaded my friend Shan to pick one up when he was down at the Saturday Farmer's Market. He returned with a four-pound shad, frozen solid.

Covel, Jr. and is of English ancestry. He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to Moore, Oklahoma (a suburb of Oklahoma City) when he was still young. Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers. Keith had a public feud with the Dixie Chicks over the song \\"Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue\\", in 2003 as well as over comments they made about President George W. Bush on stage during a concert in London. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, Natalie Maines, publicly stated that Keith's song was \\"ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant\\". Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters \\"FUTK\\" on the front at the Academy of Country Music Awards. While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for \\"Friends United in Truth and Kindness,\\" many, including host Vince Gill, took it to be a shot at Keith (\\"Fuck You Toby Keith\\"). In an October 2004 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she \\"thought that nobody would get it\\". In August 2003, Keith's representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines \\"because he's realized there are far more important things to concentrate on\\". Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate's daughter, Allison Faith Webb. However, he continues to refuse to say Maines' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith's free speech. In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote Al Gore's \\"We Campaign\\", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed. However, the idea was eventually abandoned due to scheduling conflicts.

If it weren't for the fact that Jesse has a slightly darker skin complexion you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. In fact one year Matt was out in the sun for a long time and picked up a bit of a tan so they actually did look exactly alike. Which persons melanocytes produce more melanin, Matt or Jesse? Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face).

In the 2010s, \\"multi-author blogs\\" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.

Field Marshal Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck (21 June 1884 - 23 March 1981) was a British Army commander during the Second World War. He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in India, where he rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army by early 1941. In July 1941 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East theatre, but after initial successes the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign. In June 1943 he was once more appointed Commander-in-Chief, India, where his support through the organisation of supply, maintenance and training for Slim's Fourteenth Army played an important role in its success. Auchinleck continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army after the end of the war helping, though much against his own convictions, to prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies for the Partition of India: in November 1945 he was forced to commute the more serious judicial sentences awarded against officers of the Indian National Army in face of growing unease and unrest both within the Indian population, and the British Indian Army. On 1 June 1946 he was promoted to field marshal, but he refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable. Sending a report to British Government on 28 September 1947 Auchinleck wrote: \\"I have no hesitation, whatever, in affirming that the present Indian Cabinet are implacably determined to do all in their power to prevent the establishment of the Dominion of Pakistan on firm basis.\\" He stated in the second, political part of his assessment, \\"Since 15th August, the situation has steadily deteriorated and the Indian leaders, cabinet ministers, civil officials and others have persistently tried to obstruct the work of partition of the armed forces.\\" When partition was effected in August 1947, Auchinleck was appointed Supreme Commander of all British forces remaining in India and Pakistan and remained in this role until the winding up and closure of the Supreme H.Q. at the end of November 1948. This marked his effective retirement from the army (although technically field marshals in the British Army never retire, remaining on the active list on half pay). He left India on 1 December. After a brief period in Italy in connection with an unsuccessful business project, Auchinleck retired to London, where he occupied himself with a number of charitable and business interests and became a respectably skilled watercolour painter. In 1960 he settled in Beccles in the county of Suffolk, remaining there for seven years until, at the age of eighty-four, he decided to emigrate and set up home in Marrakesh, where he died on 23 March 1981.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruits had most probably gone through heated sugar syrup, bowl A or bowl B? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"Bowl A"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences state that David Burliuk was born on March 15, 1886, in Kharkiv and indicate that he is the younger brother of Wladimir Burliuk. However, the sentences are structured differently. The first sentence begins by providing David Burliuk's birth date and then emphasizes his relation to Wladimir Burliuk.

While the date of birth is given prominence, the relationship between the two brothers is used to build on the main subject of the sentence, David Burliuk. On the other hand, the second sentence starts with David Burliuk's name and then combines both his birth date and his sibling relationship sequentially. Here, the focus remains on David Burliuk, and the additional information about his brother and birth date follows in the same sentence.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Now, I have a new situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers. Eventually, they buy the potatoes for their chips. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips. Answer this question please: Would PepsiCo potatoes be less or more herbicide tolerant than Kettle Foods'? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, GMO crops, such as those supplied by PepsiCo, have been engineered with a gene that allows them to tolerate exposure to herbicides. In comparison, Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers, which means these potatoes have not been genetically modified for herbicide tolerance.

The mixed category indicates reviews where none of the sentiments are dominant (mix of positive and negative, or borderline cases); hence it is hard to detect the primary sentiment. Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it. The \\"no sentiment expressed\\" label should be assigned to the reviews where the given aspect didn't discuss in the text. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Usage: The given review is \\"کیفیت خوبی داره طعم و عطر و رنگ مناسب و خوبی هم داره\\". This part is a Persian sentence where the reviewer is talking about the food quality, taste, aroma, and color. Part #2: Identify the questions about the reviewer's sentiment. Usage: The question is \\"نظر شما در مورد کیفیت و تازگی این تخمه و مغز طعم‌دار چیست؟\\". It asks about the reviewer's sentiment towards the quality and freshness of the flavored seeds and kernels. Part #3: Determine which sentiment categories are appropriate: \\"no sentiment expressed\\", \\"negative\\", \\"neutral\\", \\"positive\\", and \\"mixed\\". Usage: In this case, the review is \\"کیفیت خوبی داره طعم و عطر و رنگ مناسب و خوبی هم داره\\" which means \\"It has good quality, suitable and good taste, aroma, and color\\". This implies a positive sentiment towards the food's quality, taste, aroma, and color. Part #4: Infer the answer about the sentiment for the specific aspect asked in the question. Usage: The question is about the quality and freshness. The review says \\"کیفیت خوبی داره\\" which means \\"It has good quality\\". Thus, we can infer that the answer to the question is \\"positive\\", as the reviewer has expressed a positive sentiment regarding the quality of the flavored seeds and kernels. Part #5: Classify the answer based on the determined sentiment category. Usage: Since the sentiment expressed is positive, we classify the reviewer's sentiment toward the quality and freshness of the flavored seeds and kernels as \\"positive\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Fertilization of gametes products something that becomes what?\\" would be (ii) Embryo. When fertilization occurs, male and female gametes (sperm and egg cells) come together to form a single cell – a zygote. The zygote is diploid, meaning it contains both sets of chromosomes from the two parent gametes. This is a crucial stage in sexual reproduction, as it ensures the offspring inherit genetic material from both parents, resulting in genetic diversity within the species. Once fertilization is successful, and the zygote is formed, it undergoes a series of cell divisions through a process called mitosis. During mitosis, the zygote's diploid cells replicate and divide, forming a multicellular organism known as an embryo. The embryo will continue to grow and develop into a new individual organism. To recap, the process of fertilization involves the union of male and female gametes to produce a diploid zygote. The zygote then undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo, which is why the best answer to the quiz question is (ii) Embryo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press. He begins keeping a journal, to be published as a record of his experiences. As things continue, Scott feels humiliated and expresses his shame by lashing out at Louise, who is reduced to... Answer:","completion":"Considering the movie plot provided, a possible question could be: How does Scott Carey's life changes and the challenges he faces as a result of his continuous shrinking, and can he find a way to reverse the process or adapt to this new reality? In the movie, the protagonist, Scott Carey, experiences a life-altering event when he notices continuous shrinking in his size. Initially dismissed by others, he seeks medical help, and after multiple tests, he discovers that due to a rare combination of radioactive mist and exposure to insecticide, his molecular structure has been altered, causing him to shrink proportionally. As Scott's size keeps decreasing, various challenges arise in his life, which begs the question of how he deals with these changes. Initially, Scott struggles with simple daily tasks like driving a car and has to abandon his job. He becomes a national curiosity, garnering attention from the media. This attention, while giving him an opportunity to make money from his story, also adds to his feelings of humiliation and vulnerability. The shrinking process not only affects his physical attributes but has a psychological impact, causing distress and frustration that strains his relationship with his wife, Louise. As the story unfolds, the audience would be curious about how Scott comes to terms with his new reality. Can he find a way to reverse or stop the shrinking process with the help of medical research? Alternatively, does he need to adapt to his ever-changing life and find new ways to survive in a world not designed for someone of his size? Also, how does his relationship with Louise evolve, and can they overcome the challenges his condition brings into their lives?

The floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface. Q: At certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks. what is the area of land that is flooded called? Choices: - inlet - run off - lowland - floodplain A: The answer is:","completion":"floodplain. The paragraph provided states that at certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks, causing the land to be flooded. This area of land that becomes flooded is referred to as the floodplain. It further explains that the floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly flat surface. To provide more context and better understanding, let's briefly go over the other options and why they are not correct: 1. Inlet: An inlet is a narrow body of water that extends into the land from a larger body of water, such as a sea, lake, or another river. It does not have any direct connection to the overflowing of riverbanks or the creation of floodplains. 2. Runoff: Runoff refers to the water that flows over the land surface, typically after rainfall, snowmelt, or other types of precipitation. When the ground becomes saturated or is unable to absorb more water, the excess water becomes runoff. Although runoff may contribute to flooding in certain situations, it does not specifically describe the area of land that is flooded. 3. Lowland: Lowland is a geographical term that refers to an area of land that has a relatively low elevation compared to the surrounding regions. While low-lying areas can be more susceptible to flooding, the term itself does not specifically describe the area of land that becomes flooded due to an overflowing river or stream. In summary, the correct answer to the question is floodplain, as it best defines the area of land that becomes flooded when a river or stream overflows its banks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, Thompson co-founded the Hawks Athletic Club while attending I.N. Bloom Elementary School, which led to an invitation to join Louisville's Castlewood Athletic Club, a club for adolescents that prepared them for high-school sports. Ultimately he never joined any sports teams in high school. Thompson attended I.N. Bloom Elementary School, Highland Middle School, and Atherton High School, before transferring to Louisville Male High School in September 1952. Also in 1952, he was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum Literary Association, a school-sponsored literary and social club that dated to 1862. Its members at the time, generally drawn from Louisville's wealthy upper-class families, included Porter Bibb, who later became the first publisher of Rolling Stone at Thompson's behest. During this time Thompson read and admired J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man. As an Athenaeum member, Thompson contributed articles to and helped produce the club's yearbook The Spectator. The group ejected Thompson in 1955, citing his legal problems. Charged as an accessory to robbery after being in a car with the perpetrator, Thompson was sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky's Jefferson County Jail. He served 31 days and, a week after his release, enlisted in the United States Air Force. While he was in jail, the school superintendent refused him permission to take his high-school final examinations, and as a result he did not graduate.

By Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY. It's an epic battle for Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.' (Photo: Clay Enos, Warner Bros.) The Dark Knight and Man of Steel delivered a box office beatdown yet again. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is No. 1 for a second straight week with 52.4 million, according to estimates from tracking service comScore. The DC Comics film, which pits the Caped Crusader (Ben Affleck) against the Last Son of Krypton (Henry Cavill), has earned 261.5 million in just 10 days. The superhero face-off dominated despite negative reviews (29% critical approval on aggregate site RottenTomatoes.com) and a massive drop of 68% from its first weekend, when it opened to a record-shattering 166 million. \\"It is a pretty significant drop, but this was expected,\\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. With more than 681 million worldwide, \\"you have to consider it a box office winner, but on the critical front, it took a pretty hard beating. This was the poster child for that disconnect between critics and fans,\\" who gave it a B grade on CinemaScore. Batman v Superman is Zack Snyder's follow-up to 2013's Man of Steel. It co-stars Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, the female superhero's first live-action feature-film appearance in her 75-year history. The blockbuster carries a hefty price tag of 250 million. In second place, Zootopia dropped just 17% in its fifth weekend to earn 20 million. The critically adored comedy has now made 275.9 million in North America and a staggering 787.6 million globally, making it Disney's biggest animated success since 2013's Frozen (which scorched the box office with nearly 1.3 billion worldwide). Nia Vardalos' My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 held strong with 11.1 million and third place in its second weekend, which brings its total to 36.5 million. The comedy arrives more than a decade after its predecessor, which sprinted down the aisle in 2002 with 241.4 million in North America. God's Not Dead 2 managed just 8.1 million for fourth place in 2,400 theaters. The faith-based film is a sequel to the 2014 hit. Rounding out the top five, Miracles From Heaven continued to bless the box office with 7.6 million in its third weekend, dropping only 22%. The Christian drama, starring Jennifer Garner and Queen Latifah, has now earned 46.8 million. \\"For that film to be doing this well is a testament to how loyal and passionate the faith-based audience is,\\" Dergarabedian says. \\"Closing in on 50 million, it's a total moneymaking machine.\\" In limited release, Richard Linklater's Everybody Wants Some!!, a \\"spiritual sequel\\" to Dazed and Confused, scored a solid 323,000 in just 19 theaters (371,000 since opening Wednesday).

A:","completion":"The task asks you to create a picture frame message board, which is a board where you can write or pin messages, using a picture frame. Here is a simple step-by-step process to achieve this: 1. Choose a picture frame: Pick a picture frame of the desired size, shape, and color that you want for your message board. Ideally, choose one with a flat, wide border/frame that would provide enough space for writing or pinning messages. 2. Remove the glass cover and backing: Carefully remove the glass cover and any backing materials from inside the frame. Keep these in a safe place in case you want to use them again in the future. 3.

Attach the background to the frame: Use an adhesive, such as glue, double-sided tape, or glue dots, to secure the background material to the inner side of the picture frame's border. Make sure it's smooth, even and well-secured so it won't come off when you use the message board. 5. Add any desired accessories: If you want to customize your message board with additional features, such as clips for holding papers or hooks for keys, attach them securely to the frame or background. Be creative and personalize your message board to fit your needs! 6. Hang the message board: Using appropriate hardware for your wall type (e.g. nails, brackets, or adhesive wall hangers), mount the picture frame message board on your desired location. Make sure it's level and secure so it won't fall or tilt while in use. 7. Start using your message board: Now that your picture frame message board is complete, begin writing or pinning messages, notes, reminders, or even artwork.

Tom Cruise, the charismatic actor who has been delighting audiences for decades, is one such exceptional talent. With an eclectic filmography that spans multiple genres, Cruise has continually pushed himself towards surprising and memorable roles in blockbuster films. His latest role, in the remake of The Mummy, has produced yet another indelible performance - and an unexpected, yet highly catchy ringtone as well. The Movie: The Mummy (2017) A reboot of the classic Mummy films, 2017's The Mummy featured Cruise as Nick Morton, a US Army sergeant with a penchant for treasure hunting and finding himself in precarious situations. In this action-packed film, Cruise's character discovers an ancient tomb housing the remains of Princess Ahmanet, an Egyptian princess buried alive for her forbidden love. Upon opening the tomb, Morton unleashes a curse that brings about the resurrection of the princess, setting off a chain of catastrophic events. As Cruise navigates the thrilling and terrifying world of ancient curses, grave-robbing, and supernatural threats, it's not surprising he had to let out a few blood-curdling screams as part of his performance. Tom Cruise's Scream: The Unexpected Ringtone In one particularly harrowing scene, Tom Cruise's character finds himself caught in a zero-gravity plane crash. As the aircraft spirals out of control, Cruise releases an impressively sustained, spine-chilling scream that reverberates through the chaotic sequence. Unbeknownst to him at the time, this guttural display of terror would become one of the film's lasting legacies. Though the film received mixed reviews, Cruise's scream gained immense popularity on social media, taking on a life of its own. Fans saw it as an opportunity to inject a little fun into their everyday lives, with his scream ultimately being turned into a ringtone. This unexpected development speaks not only to the power of Cruise's performance but also to the golden age of technology where everything is at the tip of our collective interconnected fingers. Why the Tom Cruise Scream Ringtone Went Viral First and foremost, the sheer intensity and undeniable authenticity of Cruise's scream resonated with many viewers. While some might argue that the scream's popularity is due to the comedic irony of having such an iconic actor turn into a symbol of abject terror, the genuine emotion behind the scream cannot be denied. Secondly, the ubiquity of smartphones and the rise of social media platforms have made it easier for fans to dissect, discuss, and share interesting and resonant moments from films with their wider circles. Tom Cruise's scream, for example, was quickly turned into memes, video clips, and of course, a ringtone by fans across the globe eager to share this momentous performance with one another. Lastly, the fact that a universally recognized figure like Tom Cruise could showcase such vulnerability onscreen struck a chord with many fans. In a world where people are constantly under pressure to maintain a facade of stoic bravery, Cruise's scream offered a fleeting moment of release and validation. Choosing to use this scream as a personalized ringtone is, in some ways, reclaiming that release and commemorating the very human aspect of vulnerability. Conclusion In a strange twist of fate, Tom Cruise's screams from his 2017 film, The Mummy, have been captured and immortalized as a ringtone. This reflects not only the influence of social media and digital technology on our lives but also highlights the power of an honest and evocative performance. While it may not have been the desired outcome for the filmmakers, this unique phenomenon stands as a testament to Cruise's magnetism and the lasting impact that his performances can have on audiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen Joshua Sondheim (; born March 22, 1930) is an American composer and lyricist known for more than a half-century of contributions to musical theater. Sondheim has received an Academy Award, eight Tony Awards (more than any other composer, including a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre), eight Grammy Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, a Laurence Olivier Award, and a 2015 Presidential Medal of Freedom. He has been described by Frank Rich of The New York Times as \\"now the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.\\" His best-known works as composer and lyricist include A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, Merrily We Roll Sondheim was born into a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Etta Janet (\\"Foxy,\\" nee Fox; 1897-1992) and Herbert Sondheim (1895-1966). His father manufactured dresses designed by his mother. The composer grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and, after his parents divorced, on a farm near Doylestown, Pennsylvania. As the only child of well-to-do parents living in the San Remo on Central Park West, he was described in Meryle Secrest's biography (Stephen Sondheim: A Life) as an isolated, emotionally-neglected child. When he lived in New York, Sondheim attended ECFS, the Ethical Culture Fieldston School known simply as \\"Fieldston.\\" He later attended the New York Military Academy and George School, a private Quaker preparatory school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where he wrote his first musical, By George, and from which he graduated in 1946. Sondheim spent several summers at Camp Androscoggin. He later matriculated to Williams College and graduated in 1950. He traces his interest in theatre to Very Warm for May, a Broadway musical he saw when he was nine. \\"The curtain went up and revealed a piano,\\" Sondheim recalled. \\"A butler took a duster and brushed it up, tinkling the keys. I thought that was thrilling.\\" When Sondheim was ten, his father (already a distant figure) left his mother for another woman (Alicia, with whom he had two sons). Herbert sought custody of Stephen but was unsuccessful. Sondheim explained to biographer Secrest that he was \\"what they call an institutionalized child, meaning one who has no contact with any kind of family. You're in, though it's luxurious, you're in an environment that supplies you with everything but human contact. No brothers and sisters, no parents, and yet plenty to eat, and friends to play with and a warm bed, you know?\\" Sondheim detested his mother, who was said to be psychologically abusive and projected her anger from her failed marriage on her son: \\"When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time.\\" She once wrote him a letter saying that the \\"only regret [she] ever had was giving him birth.\\" When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral and had already been estranged from her for nearly 20 years at that point. Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, and knew no one else well. He saw a familiar face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking. Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of West Side Story's music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished \\"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\\". After West Side Story opened, Shevelove lamented the lack of \\"low-brow comedy\\" on Broadway and mentioned a possible musical based on Plautus' Roman comedies. When Sondheim was interested in the idea he called a friend, Larry Gelbart, to co-write the script. The show went through a number of drafts, and was interrupted briefly by Sondheim's next project. In 1959, Sondheim was approached by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman - cast as Mama Rose - had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances. Merrily's failure greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theatre and do movies, create video games or write mysteries: \\"I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal.\\" Sondheim and Prince's collaboration was suspended from Merrily to the 2003 production of Bounce, another failure. However, Sondheim decided \\"that there are better places to start a show\\" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: \\"I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre\\"; Lapine has a taste \\"for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular\\". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017. They collaborated on Into the Woods (1987), a musical based on several Brothers Grimm fairy tales. Although Sondheim has been called the first composer to bring rap music to Broadway (with the Witch in the opening number of \\"Into the Woods\\"), he attributes the first rap in theatre to Meredith Willson's \\"Rock Island\\" from The Music Man. The show was revived on Broadway in 2002. Sondheim and Lapine's last work together was the rhapsodic Passion (1994), adapted from Ettore Scola's Italian film Passione D'Amore. With a run of 280 performances, Passion was the shortest-running show to win a Tony Award for Best Musical. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they collaborate in other projects?","completion":"Yes, Sondheim collaborated with James Lapine in several projects. Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), and they later worked together on Into the Woods (1987) and finally on Passion (1994)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

KABUL (Reuters) - The political uproar over the prisoner swap that won the release of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity intensified on Wednesday when his hometown canceled plans for a rally celebrating his return amid allegations that he deserted. The Taliban released video of their handover of Bergdahl to U.S. special operations forces in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border on Saturday, showing the U.S. soldier seemingly dazed and anxious about the unfolding events. Bergdahl's release after being held for nearly five years in Afghanistan provoked an angry backlash in Congress among lawmakers over the Obama administration's failure to notify them in advance. Some of Bergdahl's former comrades have charged that he was captured after deserting. Heather Dawson, the city administrator of Hailey, Idaho, said that town officials had called off their June 28 rally to celebrate Bergdahl's release because they would be \\"unable to safely manage the number of people expected.\\" The small mountain community had been under pressure to cancel after claims by some of Bergdahl's former Army comrades that he had deliberately abandoned his post. That anger helped fuel congressional criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the deal to free Bergdahl in exchange for the transfer of five senior Taliban members from Guantanamo prison in Cuba to Qatar, where they were to remain for a year. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused critics of the agreement of seizing upon what should be a moment of unity to \\"play political games,\\" but Senator John McCain, a top Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, condemned the deal. \\"This was clearly a terrible idea,\\" he said. \\"These are the hardest of the hard core.\\" TALIBAN RETURNING TO FIGHT? U.S. lawmakers complained that the Obama administration did not give Congress 30 days notice required by law before transferring Guantanamo prisoners. They also expressed concern that the five were senior leaders who may return to the fight. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called Bergdahl's family on Wednesday for the first time since his release, speaking with them for about 10 minutes. He assured them the Pentagon's focus was on their son's health and return to his family, a senior official said. The White House, surprised by the angry backlash, has taken steps to try to address congressional ire over its failure to give lawmakers proper notice, offering apologies and briefings. But they have also expressed frustration over the reaction. \\"It’s been disappointing to see the politicization of the United States military’s mission to leave no man left behind,\\" one Obama administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hagel said critics should wait for all the facts to be known before rushing to judgment on Bergdahl. The administration arranged briefings for members of Congress on Wednesday and next week. The White House did not inform members of Congress, except for Reid, before the prisoner swap because they were concerned about leaks. \\"We have no idea what they were thinking,\\" one Democratic lawmaker said. Administration officials said they decided the notification issue did not apply in Bergdahl's case because of the need to act quickly because of his deteriorating health, the suddenness with which the deal came together and the need for secrecy. DETERIORATING HEALTH A U.S. intelligence analysis of videos of Bergdahl during his captivity taken in 2011 and 2013, and other intelligence, indicated that his health had deteriorated substantially over that period, one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. The official said that was one of the drivers of the decision to push ahead with an exchange. It also followed Obama's announcement last week that virtually all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016, ending more than a decade of engagement prompted by the al Qaeda-led Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. The Taliban video showed a Blackhawk helicopter landing in a barren valley in eastern Afghanistan. As a handful of U.S. special operations troops got out, two Taliban approached, one holding a makeshift white flag of truce and the other leading Bergdahl. The American team stepped briefly forward, exchanged a greeting and then led Bergdahl back to the helicopter, quickly searching him before putting him aboard, the video showed. The transaction lasted less than a minute. Bergdahl disappeared from his outpost in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, leaving behind some of his gear. One person familiar with the U.S. military’s investigation of his disappearance said it concluded he walked off the base, but it was not able to determine with certainty that he deserted. General Raymond Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said on Wednesday the Army would conduct a full review of his capture at the appropriate time. The State Department said it would look into reports by the Associated Press that the family of an American woman who disappeared in Afghanistan in 2012 with her Canadian husband had received two videos of the couple last year asking the U.S. government to help win their release from the Taliban. Caitlan Coleman was pregnant at the time of her disappearance along with her husband Joshua Boyle, the AP said. The family decided to make the videos public in light of the publicity surrounding Bergdahl's release.

The Taliban have released a video of the moment US soldier Bowe Bergdahl was handed over to American special forces after five years in captivity. He is patted down for bombs or weapons and a plastic bag that contains his only possessions is tossed away by his rescuers. Then, after less than a minute on the ground, the helicopter lifts away again for an American base, and subtitles flash across the screen: \\"Don' [sic] come back to afghanistan.\\" A still from the video showing Bowe Bergdahl's release. The video is likely to infuriate the US military by giving a glimpse of Bergdahl's condition and details of the secretive handover, including showing the face of at least one of the special forces team who carried it out. The elite commandos keep their identities secret while they serve. At one point during the video, one of the three people who climbed out of the helicopter to collect Bergdahl appears to be gesturing at the cameraman to back away. And hours after the short film was uploaded to the internet, the link to it went dead, although there are already dozens of copies on news websites. The sight of US forces shaking hands with Bergdahl's Taliban guards and then waving to their battlefield enemies as they return to the waiting aircraft may also inflame debate in America, where there has been some criticism of the deal brokered for his release. Bergdahl was exchanged for five senior Taliban who had been held at Guantánamo prison, including a former army chief, a deputy spy chief and one of the founders of the movement. They were sent to Qatar and must stay there for a year, a condition guaranteed by the ruler of the Gulf State. Barack Obama has been accused of negotiating with terrorists, although the Taliban are not listed by the US as a terror organisation. Some members of Congress also say he broke the law by not giving them advance notice of the swap. The initial excitement about recovering Bergdahl has also been clouded by claims from soldiers who served with him, that he had deserted his post in 2009 when he was captured. Bowe Bergdahl in a video showing his release. The video starts with images of Guantánamo and the arrival in Qatar of five detainees who were exchanged for the American hostage. About four minutes in, it switches to Bergdahl waiting for release in a battered pickup truck in scrubby wilderness just off a dirt road. A Taliban voiceover explains the scene, in a violent corner of eastern Afghanistan where a temporary ceasefire was declared for the handover. A still from the video showing Bowe Bergdahl's release. \\"We told them there are 18 armed fighters and the Americans said that's all right,\\" the narrator says. The camera zooms in on nearby hillsides to show Taliban soldiers standing guard with rocket-propelled grenade launchers and AK-47 rifles, some with their faces covered by scarves but others in full view of the camera. Planes, presumably US surveillance craft, circle overhead. The 28-year-old American is sitting by the window in a traditional loose white trousers and shirt, new or freshly washed for the occasion. He looks extremely nervous, with a twitch in one eye, though not particularly thin and later he walks easily towards the waiting aircraft. As they wait, he appears to exchange a few words with his captors, backing up comments from his father that since his disappearance in 2009 he had learned Pashto, the language of most Taliban, and forgotten some of his English. The last video of him speaking his mother tongue that has been made public was shot in 2010. Beside the truck one man flies a white Taliban flag tied to a rough tree branch, and a second fighter appears to co-ordinate the operation. In the next shot, Bergdahl is standing outside the vehicle, with a shawl over his shoulder, scanning the sky anxiously as two Black Hawk helicopters circle. Then one helicopter lands and three men walk swiftly out to meet another trio – Bergdahl and two captors. The American team, likely including an Afghan interpreter, briefly shake hands with the Taliban and pat down Bergdahl's torso before leading him to the helicopter. As they walk, they look back and wave. By the aircraft a small red and white plastic bag, which is the only thing Bergdahl was carrying away from his years in captivity, is thrown away by his rescuers and he is patted far more thoroughly. Then he climbs on board, his rescuers take their seats at the edge of the craft and the helicopter lifts off again. Bergdahl is now in a military hospital in Germany, undergoing physical and mental assessments; he has not yet been reunited with his family. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The political uproar over the prisoner swap that won the release of U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity intensified on Wednesday when his hometown canceled plans for a rally celebrating his return amid allegations that he deserted.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards were converted on the two shortest touchdowns?","completion":"Title: A Close Look at the Shortest Touchdowns: Yards Converted and Their Impact Introduction Touchdowns are the primary way for teams to score points in football, with the length of the scoring play varying from one-yard line plunges to long tosses and breakaway runs. In this article, we will take a closer look at the two shortest touchdowns in NFL history, the number of yards converted on these plays, and the impact they had on the teams involved and the sport as a whole. Yards Converted on the Two Shortest Touchdowns The two shortest touchdowns on record both occurred on one-yard plays. These instances are distinct, but they both share the common thread of being incredibly short distances covered to put points on the board. Here, we break down each of these unique plays and their roles within the broader context of the NFL and football lore. 1. The Famed Quarterback Sneak The first of the two shortest touchdowns was a one-yard quarterback sneak. This play is ubiquitous in football, particularly when the offense is on their opponent's one-yard line. The quarterback receives the snap from the center and follows their blockers directly through the line of scrimmage, extending the football across the goal line to score a touchdown. The quarterback sneak requires strength, agility, and timing to penetrate the defense, which often stacks the line of scrimmage to defend against this familiar play. In these situations, the offensive line must generate a strong push, while the quarterback exploits any gaps that emerge in the defense. 2. The Goal-Line Dive The other shortest touchdown involved a goal-line dive, a classic short-yardage rushing play that features the running back leaping over the top of blockers and defenders to break the plane of the goal-line. This play relies heavily on the offensive line's proficiency at creating forward momentum in the trenches, and the running back's ability to sense when and how to leap, ensuring he retains possession of the football while extending it across the goal line. As with the quarterback sneak, this one-yard plunge does not guarantee a touchdown — the defensive linemen and linebackers' role is crucial in providing a stout resistance to prevent the opponent from scoring. Impact and Importance of Short Touchdowns While the two shortest touchdowns resulted from one-yard plays, their significance within the context of the NFL should not be understated. In close matches, every yard — and, more importantly, every point scored — can have a massive impact on the outcome of the game. Successfully converting short-yardage attempts into touchdowns can provide a psychological boost for the offensive team, as it reinforces their ability to impose their will on the defense in critical situations. Moreover, short-yardage plays are often seen in the context of a larger drive, reflecting the tenacity and resilience of the offense to grind out yardage and tire out defenders. The combination of successful short-yardage plays and the elusiveness of quarterbacks and running backs making plays can bolster an offense's overall potency and efficiency. Conclusion In summary, the two shortest touchdowns on record both cover a distance of one yard. These plays — the quarterback sneak and the goal-line dive —Though small in distance, are momentous plays within the sport that demonstrate the importance of decisive gains in critical situations. Enabling teams to capitalize on every opportunity, even the smallest of yardage has the potential to impact the outcome of a game and build a winning legacy in the competitive realms of professional football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Vivacious Lady Movie plot: Lobby card for the film Vivacious Lady is a story of love at first sight between a young botany professor named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's...

He called bull when his friend said a bull can be what? - feeble - bullbleep - cow - female - charging prey The best answer is A:","completion":"He called bull when his friend said a bull can be what? Here are some explanations for each of the options: 1. Feeble: A bull is typically regarded as a strong and powerful animal, known for its large size, aggression, and ability to charge with immense force. Therefore, referring to a bull as feeble seems counterintuitive and unlikely to be accurate. It's possible that his friend was speaking metaphorically or humorously when describing the bull as feeble, but under normal circumstances, it would be incorrect to call a bull feeble. 2. Bullbleep: \\"Bullbleep\\" is a slang term used to indicate that something is false, misleading, or nonsensical. Thus, his friend might have said something that was untrue or bizarre, prompting the response that it's bullbleep. In this context, it was not a reference to a physical characteristic of a bull but rather an expression of disbelief or disagreement with the claim made. 3. Cow: A cow is a term used for an adult female of the bovine species, whereas a bull is a term for an adult male. They are two distinct types of cattle based on their gender. So, it would be incorrect to use the two words interchangeably. When his friend said a bull can be a cow, he likely responded because it's not possible for a bull to be a cow. 4. Female: As mentioned previously, bulls are adult male cattle, while cows are adult female cattle. The fundamental difference between the two lies in their gender. Therefore, when his friend suggested that a bull could be female, it did not make sense, as bulls are inherently male. 5. Charging prey: Bulls are known to charge at people, other animals, or objects when agitated or threatened. This aggressive behavior is part of a bull's natural instincts and defense mechanisms. Therefore, his friend's statement that a bull can be charging prey would be correct if referencing this instinctive trait. The best answer: The most accurate interpretation of the statement where he called bull would be when his friend claimed that a bull can be either feeble or female. In both cases, the descriptions run counter to the commonly understood characteristics of bulls that they are powerful, male animals. This likely led to a reaction of disbelief or disagreement, causing the phrase \\"bull\\" to be used as an expression of incredulity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Western Australia is Australia's largest state with a total land area of 2,529,875 square kilometres (976,790 sq mi), and the second-largest country subdivision in the world however, a significant part of it is sparsely populated. The state has about 2.6 million inhabitants, around 11% of the national total. 92% of the population lives in the south-west corner of the state. - The Blackwood River is a major river and catchment in the South West of Western Australia . The river begins at the junction of Arthur River and Balgarup River near Quelarup and travels in a south westerly direction through the town of Bridgetown then through Nannup until it discharges into the Southern Ocean at Hardy Inlet near the town of Augusta . The river has 41 tributaries including Dinninup Brook , Balingup Brook , St John Brook , Boyup Brook , Tweed River , Ti Tree Gully , Christmas Creek and Tanjannerup Creek . The upper or larger catchment area of the river is in agricultural areas , while the middle catchment area passes through forest areas , and the lower portion of the river passes into mixed forest , agricultural and residential lands . The river emerges into Flinders Bay at Augusta . It was discovered in 1827 by Captain James Stirling and named by Stirling after Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood , under whom he served as a Midshipman on HMS Warspite in 1808 -- 1909 during the Napoleonic Wars , in the North Sea and the Mediterranean . Historically it was of considerable importance in the early days of the Swan River Colony , and more recently of importance in the ecology of the Augusta - Margaret River region due to conflicts in land use policy . The upper catchment contains Toolibin Lake , a nature reserve and Ramsar site . Hardy Inlet has a number of islands -- namely Molloy Island and Thomas Island . The mouth of the river has attracted interest in its various points of opening and closing over the last 100 years , Duke Head at the west side being a benchmark location for the shifting mouth . The river is prone to occasional flooding . In 1945 it rose to the highest level recorded to that date , running 1.1 metres ( 3.6 ft ) over the Russell Street bridge in Nannup . The river flooded again in 1946 and 1947 closing roads but not causing any significant damage to towns along the river . In 1949 Nannup received 174 millimetres ( 6.85 in ) of rain in a period of seven hours , causing flooding ....

And when I say \\"someone,\\" I'm looking at you, President Obama -- or at least members of your administration. I can't fathom how Obama, one of the best orators of modern-day politics, could be such a poor advocate for what's arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration. I can assure you that if there were a law named after me -- such as \\"Obeidallahcare\\" or \\"Deanaid\\" -- I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it. Sure, most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare: the individual mandate, coverage for the uninsured, children on parents' policy until 26, carriers cannot deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition. But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds, if not thousands, of regulations. What else does the law offer, and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits? But it's clear that","completion":"the story ends with a more informed public and an ongoing discussion about the future of healthcare in the United States. As the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, was implemented, millions of Americans gained access to affordable health insurance. Many previously uninsured individuals and families were able to receive coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, the establishment of Health Insurance Marketplaces, and the availability of premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for eligible individuals. In addition to its primary goals, the ACA contained numerous provisions aimed at improving healthcare quality, increasing efficiency, and reducing healthcare disparities. President Obama and his administration made efforts to inform the public about the benefits and provisions of the ACA. They used various channels, such as town hall meetings, social media campaigns, and partnerships with celebrities and influencers to reach a wide audience. However, due to the complexity of the law and the highly polarized political climate, many Americans remained confused about its details, and misinformation was widespread. As time went on, public opinion about Obamacare slowly shifted. While some people still strongly oppose it, a significant number of Americans appreciate the benefits it has provided, such as protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions and the ability to keep children on their parents' plans until age 26. In recent years, there has been increased dialogue about new approaches to healthcare in the U.S., such as a single-payer healthcare system, publicly funded \\"Medicare for All,\\" or various alternatives. The discussion around healthcare reform is ongoing, with politicians and citizens alike expressing different opinions about the best way to provide comprehensive, affordable care for all Americans. The story of Obamacare concludes with the realization that while it has had a significant impact on the lives of many Americans, there's still much work to be done in reforming the American healthcare system. To ensure genuine progress, it is essential to prioritize the well-being of the nation's citizens and continue engaging in thoughtful, constructive discourse about the ways to achieve universal, reliable healthcare. In the end, the legacy of Obamacare serves as a reminder of the importance of informed public discourse and a determination to improve the lives of everyday Americans and future generations through meaningful reform. Healthcare remains a vital issue in the United States, and the story of Obamacare offers a strong foundation for further action and progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Donald Trump has been labelled a moron on Twitter for suggesting the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre were denied 'a fighting chance' by France's gun laws. In a series of tweets, the generously coiffed real-estate tycoon suggested the gunmen were only able to murder with impunity because there were no armed bystanders to shoot back. Twitter users' responses were mixed, but generally negative. The first reply, by Molly Lambourn from Melbourne, Australia, said: '[W]hat a complete idiot. More people would have f***ing died!!! Heaps of crossfire!!!' Trump's tweets, posted less than 12 hours after news broke of the slaughter in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom, said: 'If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance. 'Isn't it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world? 'Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!' By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first tweet alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. About another 80 responses mentioned the word 'idiot', although not all were directly critical of Trump. However, Trump's pronouncement was chosen as a 'favourite' by 933 people and retweeted 1,488 times, and many - though by no means the majority - of responses were supportive of his view. Responding to Trump, Terry Brown, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, wrote on Twitter: '[G]ive everyone guns - how can American murder scenes be wrong?' Canadian Cari Ramsey from London, Ontario, wrote: '[N]one of them would have had a shot! NONE! 2 guys with AK47s surprised a room. Guns would have done nothing!' Steve Dickinson, from Cumbria, told Trump: 'Just like the guys in the Boston Marathon hey Donald?' Another user who identified herself only as HillyFoz replied to the tycoon: 'THEY WERE JOURNALISTS. NOT STUPID GUN TOTING RED NECKS. GO BOIL YOUR WIG'. Trumps tweets: By this morning, Trump had been labelled a moron in 38 of the replies to his first of the three tweets alone, while a further 44 responses to that same tweet had labelled him stupid. Moreover, gun laws in France are not so restrictive as Trump seems to believe. Possession of automatic firearms is banned across the European Union, except in special circumstances. But that law is similar in the U.S., where citizens must have permission from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to possess fully automatic weapons. In France citizens must have a licence to buy a weapon, but once one is obtained they can use it to buy handguns and even semi-automatic rifles - the kind where all you have to do is pull the trigger to fire. Both such weapons are banned in the mainland UK. 'Je suis Charlie': Journalists hold placards reading 'I am Charlie' as they hold a minute of silence at the offices of news agency Agence France Presse in Paris. Despite the law, France has long had a problem with organised criminal gangs with access Kalashnikov assault rifles, said Mark Mastaglio of the Forensic Firearms Consultancy. 'There was also a spate in France of criminals using rocket-propelled grenades for robberies and even prison breaks,' Mr Mastaglio told MailOnline. He said French criminals' relative ease of access to automatic weapons raised an important question about the circumstances of yesterday's massacre in Paris, where the gunmen fired in single shots throughout. 'If they did have fully-automatic Kalashnikovs and they opted to use single shots that suggests a degree of military training, because as you use the fully automatic fire accuracy goes down.' An injured person is carried into an ambulance after the massacre at the offices of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France. High security: A French soldier patrols in front of the Eiffel Tower after the attack yesterday. Seven people have been arrested over the Charlie Hebdo massacre, but two 'armed and dangerous' brothers with links to terrorist groups going back at least a decade today remained on the run. As the manhunt for Cherif and Said Kouachi continued, their alleged getaway driver Hamyd Mourad, 18, turned himself into police in Charleville-Mezieres in northern France. The fact that two were still at large almost 24 hours after a gun battle in which two policemen died alongside ten others, mainly magazine staff, was also a cause for huge concern. France is today holding a day of mourning for the 12 people killed during the country's worst terrorist atrocity this century. A minute's silence will be observed at midday across the country and the bells of Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital will toll.

News article: Dazed & Confused star Jason London was arrested on Sunday morning outside an Arizona bar for disorderly conduct, fighting and assault, but in an exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, a rep for the actor says he was brutally attacked and unlike the police report states, he did not punch a bouncer in the face. According to the police report, authorities were called to the Martini Ranch in Scottsdale on Sunday morning at 1:42 a.m. and found Jason beat up, and the bar’s bouncer told them after Jason punched him in the face, they were forced to throw him out of the bar and he was hurt in the process — but Jason’s camp has a very different account of the incident. EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS: Jason London’s Injuries After Arizona Bar Attack “The details of the events leading up to the incident are still being worked out with the help of many eyewitness testimonies, with the testimony of individuals who were there with Jason for the duration of the evening, and with the recollection Jason does have. We will get to the bottom of the specifics undoubtedly,” a rep for Jason told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview. “The charges against Jason indicate that he is the assailant in a ‘Multiple Victim Assault,’ as described by the bouncers to the arresting officer. It is a fact of note that Jason does not have one bump, bruise, red mark – not so much as a scratch – on his hands.” PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots As seen in the photo exclusively obtained by RadarOnline.com of Jason in the hospital, Jason sustained considerable injury to his face, but shows no marks on his hands consistent with throwing a punch at the bouncer, as is claimed. “His face however sustained injuries which are indicative not of his 145-pound frame assaulting four 250+ pound bouncers but rather indicate a repeated, intentional, aggravated assault where excessive force was used,” the rep continued. PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Battled Drinking Problems “Additionally, assuming that these four bouncers are trained fighters, which most are, that quickly becomes assault with a deadly weapon. Jason’s injuries clearly demonstrate skilled and intentionally inflicted injury and harm.” Jason, 40, remains in the hospital and is being treated for a right orbital fracture, which extends down through his cheek and into his upper jaw and mouth, a right maxillary sinus fracture, multiple contusions, multiple hematomas, concussion, multiple abrasions and a lot of swelling. PHOTOS: Stars Who OD’d “We do know that the police arrested Jason on charges of suspicion of a multiple victim assault based on one bouncer’s account and that one of the other bouncers corroborated his buddy’s story,” the rep continued. “Since that time witnesses have come forward to give an entirely different account of what they saw that does not match in any way the report given by the bouncers.” PHOTOS: Celebrity Death Threats While Jason’s camp admits he was drinking the night of the alleged assault, they claim any belligerent or rude comments made by Jason absolutely didn’t warrant the injuries he sustained. “This was not the result of injuries sustained due to a belligerent patron during routine removal. These are injuries sustained of a brutal attack using excessive force and deliberate and intentional beatings designed to injure and cause maximum damage. Which they did,” the rep said. PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time “Bars are institutions where there are drunk people who are sometimes inappropriate and even sometimes violent. It is the bouncer’s job to remove the problem and if it is necessary to use force in order to secure the safety of the establishment and patrons they are entitled to do so. “It is not acceptable to retaliate with brutality once that has been accomplished. Jason’s injuries are consistent with a brutal attack with deliberately and expertly aimed landed shots to the head which, according to eyewitnesses, continued even after he was unconscious.” PHOTOS: Most Shocking ‘Not Guilty’ Verdicts The rep claims eyewitnesses at the bar have given no testimony that Jason was being “inappropriate or aggressive in any way.” “Jason does remember in the midst of having a good time that someone said something about Jason looking at his friend’s girl wrong,” the rep said.

Context: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

So is it important enough to run out of the room with your phone held half-up in signal to the others that this is a call too important to miss? Truecaller may be able to help with that. \\"If you download Truecaller you will never have to worry about saving contacts to your phone book, everything will be in the cloud.\\" says Alan Mamedi, chief executive and co-founder of Truecaller. He recalls his own phonecall-in-a-meeting dilemma as being his motivation to help create the app, which he believes could be on every smartphone across the globe. \\"If you receive a call from a number you don't have we'll show that information, if there is a sales call coming in we will warn you about that. \\"Or if you just want to make an outbound call in a much better way; by knowing if your friend is available or your friend is on a phone call then you can use Truecaller.\\" Truecaller uses a database of more than two billion phone numbers to tell you who is phoning you. On certain smartphone operating systems it will show that person's name, where they are from, and in many cases even display their picture. It then uses crowd-sourced information to recognise nuisance calls and prevent them ever taking a second more of your time. \\"In the UK or US every sixth call would be a spam caller,\\" says Nami Zarringhalam, co-founder of Truecaller. \\"People in general get more spam calls than they receive calls from family members. So this is a big issue we're pinpointing and providing a solution for.\\" Alan Mamedi, goes on to explain how the data is collected: \\"If you receive a call from a number and we can't detect it, then you, as a user, can actually add that information. \\"But we also partner with different data providers to fill in the empty gaps\\". However according to Nishanth Sastry, senior lecturer in the centre for telecommunications research at King's College, London, it's this aspect of the company that is open to scrutiny. If a phone user shares the names and numbers in their contacts book with an app, that then relays those details to the world, it's not that phone user's information to share, he says. \\"It's not their own information they are sharing, it is their friends' information they are sharing. \\"And they are sharing this information with people that they don't know. That's a privacy issue for friends - who have never seen the terms and conditions of Truecaller.\\" Alan Mamedi, doesn't believe this to be an issue: \\"We made it super easy for anyone to un-list their number on our website, we don't require any verification or such. \\"This has been the case since day one. It's part of our philosophy that it should be super simple to just un-list your number. \\"You just go on our website and then it's gone forever.\\" Now Alan, Nami and their team occupy a series of plush offices. It's a long way from where they first began back in 2009. \\"We were sitting in my one room apartment, which was basically just my kitchen and bedroom in the same room,\\" says Nami. \\"We started to build Truecaller with servers that we had bought, building an application for our own mobile phones.\\" They then decided to release it and within the first week say they had 10,000 new users. \\"We decided to start a company and so resigned from our full-time jobs,\\" says Alan. \\"Since then we've grown really, really fast. \\"We have 200 million users globally. Just last year we went from 100 million users to 200 million. We've definitely seen an exponential growth globally, especially in the emerging markets.\\" Truecaller, he says, also has a few, less obvious uses. \\"One of the cases we've seen in India is women who before they jump in a cab actually verify the cab driver who is calling them. \\"We with some confidence can say, hey this is a cab driver who's calling you. Or even say if you have friends in common with this cab driver - and that adds a safety layer which we never thought about in the past.\\" Despite adding 63 new users a minute on average since its creation in 2009, Alan has even bigger ambitions. \\"The number one app that people are using everyday is your phone app and no one has innovated in that space. \\"Truecaller is changing that.

Step 2: Establish a motivating goal for the protagonist Dre's dream is to become a successful martial artist and create his own martial arts action film. He wishes to win an upcoming state-wide martial arts championship to prove his talent and capture the interest of a renowned movie producer. Step 3: Create a mentor character Dre meets Mr. Chen, a warm-hearted martial arts master, who agrees to train him for the championship. Mr. Chen recognizes Dre's potential and passion for martial arts and believes that Dre can bring fresh energy and perspectives to the world of martial arts films.

So, even when speaking Finnish, people would still refer to the city of Westminster in Colorado with the same name, although the pronunciation might slightly vary according to the Finnish phonetic rules.

However, Finnish speakers would still try to get close to the original pronunciation as much as possible while using their language's phonetic system. Therefore, \\"Westminster, Colorado\\" would essentially remain the same, but with a slight Finnish accent. Keep in mind that Finnish people might use the Finnish language to describe the geographical location or additional details about the city, but the city's name would remain unchanged. For example, when mentioning that Westminster is located in the United States, a Finnish speaker might say: \\"Westminster, Colorado, sijaitsee Yhdysvalloissa.\\" In this sentence, \\"sijaitsee\\" means \\"is located,\\" and \\"Yhdysvalloissa\\" indicates \\"in the United States.\\""},{"prompt":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Therefore, about 12.37 lunations (365.24 days divided by 29.53 days) occur in a tropical year. In the widely used Gregorian calendar, there are 12 months (the word month is derived from moon) in a year, and normally there is one full moon each month. Each calendar year contains roughly 11 days more than the number of days in 12 lunar cycles. The extra days accumulate, so every two or three years (seven times in the 19-year Metonic cycle), there is an extra full moon. The extra full moon necessarily falls in one of the four seasons, giving that season four full moons instead of the usual three, and, hence, a blue moon. Question: is there a month with two full moons?","completion":"Yes, there can be a month with two full moons. This phenomenon typically occurs when the first full moon takes place at the beginning of the month and the second full moon occurs towards the end of the month. The term \\"blue moon\\" is used to describe this occurrence of an additional full moon. Since one lunation, or lunar cycle, lasts about 29.53 days, and most months contain 30 or 31 days, it is possible for two full moons to fall within the same calendar month. This phenomenon usually happens every 2.7 years on average. The phrase \\"once in a blue moon\\" comes from the rarity of experiencing two full moons in a single month. However, it's essential to note that despite the name \\"blue moon,\\" the moon does not actually appear blue during this second full moon. The term has more to do with the rarity of the occurrence rather than the color of the moon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Unfamiliarity with earthquakes: Since this is the narrator's first earthquake, they might not know how to react or what to expect during the event. This unfamiliarity with earthquakes could amplify their anxiety and fear. 2. Severity of the earthquake: The description of the building shaking and swaying indicates that the earthquake was quite strong or at least powerful enough to cause noticeable effects. The intensity of the tremors can be alarming and may contribute to the narrator's concern. 3. Potential for injury and damage: Earthquakes pose a risk to both people's safety and the structural integrity of buildings, especially if the building is not designed for earthquake resistance. The narrator might be worried about potential injuries to themselves and their colleagues, as well as damage to the workplace. 4. Uncertainty about aftershocks: Earthquakes are often followed by aftershocks, which can occur minutes, hours, or even days after the main event. The uncertainty about when and where these aftershocks might happen can be unsettling and lead to additional concern for the narrator. 5. Reaction of colleagues: The fact that everyone at work stood in doorways until the earthquake was over suggests that the situation was taken seriously by everyone present.

If The route there runs through groves of willow, used for the local cricket-bat industry, and fields of saffron., can we conclude that \\"The path there runs through arid desert land, with nothing growing except for a few scrubby bushes.\\"? Options: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","completion":"C). no It is not possible to conclude that \\"The path there runs through arid desert land, with nothing growing except for a few scrubby bushes\\" based on the description provided. The route described as running through groves of willow, used for the local cricket-bat industry, and fields of saffron, suggest an entirely different type of environment. Firstly, willow trees typically require a wet or damp environment, with moist, well-drained soil. They often grow near water sources, such as rivers, streams, or ponds. The presence of thriving willow groves indicates that the region likely receives an adequate amount of water, which is in contrast to the arid desert land described in the statement. Moreover, the mention of a local cricket-bat industry suggests that the area has a sustainable resource in the willow trees, which would be unlikely if the land was arid and unable to support such vegetation. Furthermore, saffron, a valuable and sought-after spice, is derived from the saffron crocus flower. Saffron crocuses typically grow in regions with mild winters and relatively warm, dry summers. They require well-drained soil and can grow at various altitudes. While saffron can sometimes be cultivated in regions with low rainfall, the presence of fields dedicated to saffron growth implies that the area is not arid and inhospitable to plant life, as described in the statement.

Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves.

Medals are awarded in four disciplines: men's (boy's) singles, ladies' (girl's) singles, pair skating, and ice dancing in four colors: gold (first), silver (second), bronze (third), and pewter (fourth) on five levels, senior, junior, novice, intermediate, and juvenile. The event is also used to determine the U.S. teams for the World Championships, World Junior Championships, Four Continents Championships, and Winter Olympics, however, U.S. Figure Skating reserves the right to consider other results. - Ice dancing is a discipline of figure skating that draws from ballroom dancing. It joined the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, and became a Winter Olympic Games medal sport in 1976. - U.S. Figure Skating is the national governing body for the sport of figure skating on ice in the United States. It is recognized as such by the United States Olympic Committee \\"USOC\\" under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act and is the United States member of the International Skating Union (\\"ISU\\"). Although the name of the organization is the United States Figure Skating Association it is known as and conducts business under the name U.S. Figure Skating. Founded in 1921, U.S. Figure Skating regulates and governs the sport and defines and maintains the standard of skating proficiency. It specifies the rules for testing, competitions and all other figure skating related activities.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin. Two years later, Martin's body has matured to that of a 25-year-old. On his fifth birthday, Bartok presents Martin with a bungalow on the Bartok facility's property. He also...

Among the options provided, leukemia is the most accurate answer. This is because, according to Fact 2, leukemias are cancers of the blood, which means that they result from uncontrolled cell division in the blood cell-forming tissues. It's important to understand why the other options are not correct answers: - AIDS: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is not characterized by uncontrolled cell division but rather by the weakening of the immune system, which makes the person more susceptible to various infections and diseases. - Fever: A fever is a temporary increase in body temperature, often due to an infection. It is a symptom of an underlying condition, not a disease involving uncontrolled cell division. - Mitosis: Mitosis is a normal cellular process where a cell divides into two identical daughter cells. It is not a disease but a mechanism of cell division and growth in the body. - Cigarettes: Cigarettes are not a disease; they are a product known to contain harmful substances, including carcinogens that can increase the risk of developing various types of cancer. Cigarette smoking itself does not directly cause uncontrolled cell division but contributes to the formation of cancerous cells by damaging healthy tissues. - Diseased cells: This term is too vague and could represent any cells affected by various pathological conditions, not solely the ones exhibiting uncontrolled cell division. - Smoking: Like cigarettes, smoking is an activity or behavior known to have negative health consequences, including increased cancer risk. While smoking can contribute to the development of cancer due to the intake of various harmful substances, smoking itself is not a disease involving uncontrolled cell division. - Parasites: Parasites are organisms that live on or within a host organism, deriving their sustenance at the host's expense. While some parasites may cause diseases, they do not typically lead to uncontrolled cell division in the host.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Answer: Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields , and detect water pressure and currents. Question: how does taste differ from the other senses? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, taste does differ from other senses in various ways. To understand how taste differs from other senses, it is essential to examine the primary sensory systems and their functions. The five primary senses are sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Each of these senses allows humans and animals to perceive and interpret the world around them uniquely. Taste, also known as gustation, is a chemosensory sense primarily concerned with perceiving flavors present in food and other substances. This sense relies on the activation of specialized taste receptor cells located on the taste buds, primarily found on the tongue but also present on the soft palate, throat, and esophagus. These receptor cells are connected to nerve fibers that send signals to the gustatory cortex in the brain, allowing us to perceive and process the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami. The other senses, in comparison, function through different mechanisms: 1. Sight (vision) - Vision is a highly complex sense that relies on the detection and interpretation of light. Photoreceptor cells in the retina (rods and cones) convert light stimuli into electrochemical signals, which are transmitted along the optic nerves to the brain's visual cortex. This process allows us to perceive colors, shapes, and movements, among other visual cues. 2. Hearing (audition) - The perception of sound occurs through the mechanical transfer of sound waves through the outer, middle, and inner ear structures. The inner ear consists of the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure whose hair cells transform the mechanical vibrations into electrical nerve impulses that travel to the brain's auditory cortex. 3. Touch (somatosensation) - This sense encompasses multiple sensory modalities, including pressure, temperature, pain, and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). Various types of touch-sensitive receptor cells are spread throughout the skin, muscles, tendons, and joint capsules, and their activation sends signals to the somatosensory cortex in the brain. 4. Smell (olfaction) - Like taste, smell is also a chemosensory sense, but it deals with the detection of volatile molecules in the air. The olfactory epithelium, a specialized tissue in the nasal cavity, contains olfactory receptor cells that bind to odorant molecules and send signals through the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulb in the brain. This sense allows us to perceive and identify a wide range of scents. Some key differences between taste and the other senses include: - Taste is limited to the detection of flavors in food and substances, while the other senses, such as sight and hearing, enable us to perceive a broader spectrum of stimuli, such as light and sound. - Taste relies on taste buds and receptor cells within the mouth, while the other senses have specialized organs or structures throughout the body that are crucial to the perception of stimuli. - The number of basic taste qualities is limited to five (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami), while the range of sensations experienced through the other senses is much more extensive and varied. - Taste and smell are chemosenses that allow us to sense chemical compounds, whereas the other senses (sight, hearing, and touch) respond to different types of physical stimuli like light, sound, and mechanical pressure. In summary, taste differs from other senses in the types of stimuli it is designed to detect, the specific receptor cells and structures involved, and the range of sensations it allows us to experience. While taste is primarily concerned with detecting and interpreting flavors in food and other substances, the other senses serve a more diverse array of functions, from perceiving light, sound, and other physical stimuli to providing us with critical information about our environment and our bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Veneman served as USDA Secretary from January 20, 2001 to January 20, 2005, leaving to become the fifth executive director of UNICEF. Veneman began her legal career as a staff attorney with the General Counsel's office of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in Oakland, California, in 1976. In 1978, she returned to Modesto, where she served as a Deputy Public Defender. In 1980, she joined the Modesto law firm of Damrell, Damrell and Nelson, where she was an associate and later a partner. Veneman joined the United States Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service in 1986, serving as Associate Administrator until 1989. During this time she worked on the Uruguay Round talks for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). She subsequently served as Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs from 1989 to 1991. From 1991 to 1993, she served as United States Department of Agriculture's Deputy Secretary, the first woman appointed as the Department's second-highest-ranking official. At this point Veneman took a break from political and administrative office to practice with the law firm and lobby group Patton, Boggs & Blow and also served on several boards of directors and advisory groups. In 1995 Veneman re-entered government, when she was appointed Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, again being the first woman to hold the position.

Please answer this question: Whose symphony No 3 in E Flat contains a funeral march?","completion":"Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, Op. 55, commonly known as the Eroica (\\"heroic\\" in Italian) Symphony, is a pivotal work in the Western classical music tradition. Completed in 1804, the symphony is widely regarded as a groundbreaking composition, as it marks Beethoven's departure from the classical traditions of his predecessors, such as Haydn and Mozart, and ushers in the Romantic period. The Eroica Symphony consists of four movements: 1. Allegro con brio 2. Marcia funebre: Adagio assai (Funeral March) 3. Scherzo: Allegro vivace 4. Finale: Allegro molto The second movement, titled \\"Marcia funebre: Adagio assai,\\" is an emotionally powerful funeral march. A funeral march, known for its solemnity and respectful nature, is an instrumental musical composition reflecting the mournful and tragic ambiance of a funeral procession. Beethoven's funeral march in the Eroica Symphony is unique and innovative for a few reasons. Traditionally, funeral marches used a simple binary form. However, Beethoven expands this form, utilizing a more complex ternary structure. The movement contains a rich harmonic palette, exploring various tonalities, and displays a variety of contrasting emotions and moods. This emotionally charged movement serves as an essential centerpiece of the symphony, providing a dramatic contrast to the other movements' more energetic and vibrant character. The Eroica Symphony was initially dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte, as Beethoven admired him as an embodiment of enlightenment ideals and a champion of liberty. However, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor in May 1804, Beethoven became disillusioned with the leader, fearing that power had corrupted him. Consequently, Beethoven erased the dedication to Napoleon from the title page of his symphony, leaving only the name \\"Sinfonia eroica\\" and the subtitle \\"composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.\\" In conclusion, Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, commonly known as the Eroica Symphony, by Ludwig van Beethoven, is the composition that contains the funeral march in its second movement. This groundbreaking work profoundly influenced the symphonic genre and served as a stepping stone in the evolution of Western classical music, bridging the Classical and Romantic periods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the year 1347 in Garfagnana, a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile in Lunigiana, a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him get back home. The two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a deaf-mute, in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. Fernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is the inhalation of oxygen-rich air. To complete the description of the process, it should be as follows: 1. Inhalation: The first step in the process is when we breathe in oxygen-rich air through our nose or mouth. Depending on the air quality and the presence of potential allergens, it is generally preferable for this process to take place through the nose, as the nasal hairs and mucus can help to filter out harmful particles. 2. Oxygen passage: The oxygen in the inhaled air passes through the bronchial tubes, which are airway passages that connect the trachea (windpipe) to the lungs. These tubes branch into smaller airways called bronchioles, facilitating the movement of the essential gases into and out of the lungs. 3. Oxygen diffusion: Once in the lungs, the oxygen travels across the thin walls of the alveoli (tiny air sacs) into the surrounding capillaries (small blood vessels). Within the capillaries, the oxygen can bind to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, which enable its efficient transport throughout the body. 4. Blood circulation: Oxygenated blood from the lungs is pumped by the heart to the rest of the body through the arterial system. Red blood cells release oxygen, which diffuses into tissues and cells, where it can be used for various metabolic activities. 5. Cellular respiration: Inside cells, oxygen is used in processes like cellular respiration and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that serves as an energy source for various cellular functions. As a byproduct of cellular respiration, carbon dioxide is produced, a waste gas that must be removed from the body. 6. Carbon dioxide transport: Red blood cells in the venous system take up carbon dioxide from the cells, where it either dissolves in the blood plasma or binds to hemoglobin. The blood carrying carbon dioxide then returns to the heart and is pumped back to the lungs. 7. Carbon dioxide release: In the lungs, the carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli, where it is then expelled from the body during exhalation, completing the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ReadmoreaboutLuxembourg What's a sentence that uses these characters?","completion":"Luxembourg, a small European nation nestled between Germany, France, and Belgium, has a rich history that dates back to the Roman era. This landlocked country is known for its remarkable geographical landscape and cultural heritage, with its official languages, Luxembourgish, German, and French, contributing to its multi-faceted identity. Luxembourg, with an area of about 2,586 square kilometers, is one of the smallest sovereign nations in Europe, but it plays a significant role in the European Union due to its strategic location in the heart of Western Europe. In the early ages, Luxembourg was home to the Treveri, a Celtic-Germanic tribe, which contributed immensely to the development of the region. During the Roman era, the land was incorporated into the Roman province of Belgica, acting as a crossing point between the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Notably, the Romans established the foundations for many of the current educational, administrative, and social structures existing in Luxembourg and the surrounding region. Luxembourg's medieval period saw the emergence of its influential dynasties and powerful rulers, such as William I, who was initially appointed by the Holy Roman Emperor to govern Luxembourg. The House of Luxembourg, consisting of high-ranking nobles, managed to produce several kings and emperors during the later Middle Ages. Count Henry VII, a member of the House of Luxembourg, held the position as the King of Germany and even the Holy Roman Emperor, a testament to Luxembourg's standing during this era. The history of Luxembourg is marked by crucial alliances, territorial conflicts, and invasions by major European powers. During its tumultuous existence, the nation experienced periods of Spanish, Austrian, French, and Prussian occupation, only to regain its autonomy and political influence. Today, the remnants of these occupations persist in Luxembourg's architectural heritage, including the renowned Bock Casemates and the picturesque Vianden Castle. Luxembourg was one of the founding members of the European Union, the European Coal and Steel Community, and the NATO alliance, demonstrating its commitment to stability and cooperation in Europe. Following the devastating World War II era, Luxembourg experienced rapid economic growth, transforming from a predominantly agricultural society to a highly industrialized one, driven by the thriving steel industry. This economic transformation propelled Luxembourg to become one of the wealthiest nations globally with an impressive GDP per capita. In contemporary Luxembourg, the financial sector remains among the most vital pillars of its economy, as the nation established itself as an international financial hub over the past decades. The country also focuses on diversifying its economy through the development of information technology, logistics, and life sciences. Another trait that makes Luxembourg so fascinating is its wide-ranging commitment to sustainability, with comprehensive environmental policies and investment in renewable energy. In conclusion, the small yet influential nation of Luxembourg has a rich and complex history shaped by the European powers that have occupied its territory at different times. Known for its stunning landscape, architectural masterpieces, and resilient economy, Luxembourg is a testament to the power of perseverance amid the continent's tumultuous history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer Joe Boyd, who had worked with Fairport Convention and Nick Drake, to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food; the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up.

A:","completion":"Bertalan Farkas and Georgi Ivanov share the mutual occupation of being astronauts. Bertalan Farkas, who was born on August 2, 1949 in Gyulaháza, Hungary, became the first Hungarian astronaut in history. He flew on the Soyuz 36 mission to the Salyut 6 Space Station as part of Intercosmos, a spaceflight program designed to give nations on the side of the Soviet Union assistance in manned and unmanned space exploration. Intercosmos represented a major diplomatic and technological achievement meant to both display solidarity with other socialist countries and provide the Soviet Union with valuable scientific data collected by foreign astronauts. Farkas spent almost eight days in space in 1980 as part of this mission, and continues to hold the title of the first and only Hungarian astronaut. Meanwhile, Georgi Ivanov is Bulgaria's first man in space. He was born on July 2, 1940 in Lovech, Bulgaria, and is also a product of the Intercosmos program. Ivanov made his space journey on the Soyuz 33 mission in 1979 to the Salyut 6 Space Station, just a year before Farkas. However, due to a critical failure upon re-entry, the full mission objectives were not achieved. Despite this, Ivanov returned safely to Earth, making his experience an important part of space travel history. Both Farkas and Ivanov underwent rigorous training to become astronauts and so have shared experiences and challenges related to their chosen profession. Their rigorous training included a multitude of physical, technical, and psychological challenges designed to prepare them for the uncertainties of space travel. They had to go through survival training, intensive study of spacecraft systems, simulation exercises, zero-G training, and many other aspects to ensure they were fully equipped to deal with any situation that could arise during space travel.

He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour. The lead conspirators, Farrington and Foster, discuss preparations for the assassination. Obtaining Ferguson's approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind.

Comes after the U.N. voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status. Palestinians believe construction here would essentially cut the West Bank in half. Group: Currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants. Article:","completion":"Title: Israel Plans to Construct Settlements in East 1, or E1, Zone in the West Bank amidst U.N. Granting Palestine Non-Member Observer Status Introduction: (Step 1: Provide a brief background of the situation and mention the main points of the article.) The Israeli government has laid out plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank. This development comes on the heels of the United Nations' decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status. Many Palestinians believe that the construction in the E1 zone would essentially divide the West Bank and further complicate the already strained Israeli-Palestinian relationship. Body: (Step 2: Address the main points - Israel's construction plans, U.N. granting Palestine non-member observer status, Palestinians' concerns, and existing settlements.) 1. Israel's Construction Plans The Israeli government has announced plans to construct new settlements in the E1 zone, an area located in the West Bank. The proposed construction would expand the existing Israeli settlements and continue the encroachment on Palestinian land. 2. U.N. Granting Palestine Non-Member Observer Status Recently, the United Nations voted in favor of granting non-member observer status to Palestine. Although this new status does not grant full membership to Palestine, it indicates international recognition of the need for a Palestinian state and a movement towards a two-state solution in the region. 3. Palestinians' Concerns The construction in the E1 zone raises significant concerns among Palestinians, who argue that it would essentially cut the West Bank in half. This division would further restrict the movement of Palestinians between different areas in the West Bank and limit their access to essential services, making it difficult for them to carry out their daily lives. 4. Existing Settlements in the West Bank Currently, there are 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with an approximate population of 325,000 Israeli settlers. These settlements have long been a point of contention between Israel and Palestine, as the presence of Israeli settlers on Palestinian lands violates international law and hinders the establishment of a viable Palestinian state. Conclusion: (Step 3: Summarize the main points and discuss the potential implications of the situation.) Israel's plan to construct additional settlements in the E1 zone exacerbates existing tensions between Israel and Palestine, particularly in light of the U.N.'s decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status. The expansion of settlements in the E1 zone could fundamentally alter the landscape of the West Bank, making it even more challenging to reach a peaceful resolution and a two-state solution in the region. It remains to be seen how both sides will navigate this complex and evolving situation."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2.

Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door.

He was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi. Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Hypothesis: Modi is within the first 15 Prime Ministers of India","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that Narendra Modi is within the first 15 Prime Ministers of India. This hypothesis is grounded in the information extracted from the paragraph, which highlights key aspects of Modi's career. The context states that Narendra Modi is the \\"14th and current Prime Minister of India.\\" From this, we are able to infer that he is one among the first 15 Prime Ministers, as 14 falls within the range of numbers from 1 to 15. As the leader of the country since May 2014, Modi has held a significant role in Indian politics. Additionally, his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and his status as a Member of Parliament for Varanasi serve to reinforce the importance of his political career. Furthermore, the context mentions that Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and that he is a Hindu nationalist as well as a member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organization. This offers a more comprehensive understanding of his political affiliations and illustrates the ideologies he supports.

Pope Leo X, threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican, supported the French candidacy. The prince-electors themselves, with the exception of Frederick of Saxony, who refused to countenance the campaigning, promised their support to both candidates at once. Before his death, Maximilian had already promised sums of 500,000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes, but Francis offered up to three million, and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the Fuggers. The final outcome, however, was not determined by the exorbitant bribes, which included Leo promising to make the Archbishop of Mainz his permanent legate. The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause, and when Charles put an army in the field near Frankfurt, where they were meeting, the Electors obligingly voted for him. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 23 October 1520, by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the Low Countries.

Review: This book is so terrible! If I could I would give it a rating of negative five stars, but one star is the lowest I can give. Answer: A:","completion":"The product review in question clearly carries a negative tone. The dissatisfaction and disappointment of the reviewer are explicitly expressed throughout the review, starting with the title itself, which repeats the word \\"terrible\\" three times. This strongly emphasizes the negative sentiment the reviewer feels about the book. The reviewer goes on to say that the book is \\"so terrible,\\" further reinforcing their negative opinion. The use of exclamation points highlights the strength of the reviewer's feelings, suggesting that they not only disapprove of the book but also feel strongly enough about it to emphasize their distaste. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that if it were possible, they would give the book a rating of \\"negative five stars.\\" This hyperbolic statement demonstrates just how much the reviewer dislikes the book, as the standard rating system typically only allows for a minimum of one star. By wishing for a lower possible rating, the reviewer is trying to convey that the book is not merely subpar but actually deserving of more criticism than the rating system even allows. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer gives the book the lowest possible rating of one star leaves no doubt about the overall negative tone of the review. The one-star rating indicates that the reviewer sees very little, if any, redeeming qualities in the book and would not recommend it to others. In conclusion, the product review displays a clear negative tone, evident from the title, word choice, use of hyperbole, and the lowest possible star rating given to the book. The reviewer's dissatisfaction and disappointment with the book are strongly communicated, leaving no ambiguity regarding their unfavorable opinion of the product."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species . These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct ( Figure below ).

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: How old is Tony in the movie? 25 Answer:","completion":"Title: Chasing Time Genre: Drama, Science Fiction, Coming-of-Age Plot: In a small town nestled in the countryside, the story revolves around 25-year-old Tony, a mechanical genius and budding inventor. He is well-known in the local community for his skill in fixing old broken machinery and his love for antique items. Tony, however, fears the passage of time and wishes to turn back the clock to relive the glory days of his youth when his parents were still alive. The movie opens with Tony blowing out candles on his 25th birthday cake, surrounded by friends and family, but his eyes are lost in thought, reminiscing about the past. An old friend, Sarah, notices his distant demeanor and offers to listen, providing comfort and understanding on how he feels about turning 25. Determined to change the course of his life, Tony decides to break away from the monotony of adulthood and embarks on an ambitious journey to invent a time machine. He puts his heart and soul into the project, often becoming isolated in his workshop for days on end, with only Sarah regularly checking on him. As rumors of Tony's strange invention spread throughout the town, it catches the attention of a mysterious and wealthy investor, Mr. Grayson, who offers financial support and resources for his project. As the story progresses, Tony and Sarah's relationship deepens, and she finds herself torn between being supportive and worrying about Tony's obsession with turning back time. Tony, fully aware of Sarah's concerns, promises her that he will never forget their time together, no matter how far back he goes. Finally, after months of laboring, Tony's invention comes to fruition. He successfully creates a machine capable of traveling through time. However, during its test run, unforeseen consequences arise. The machine's energy destabilizes the fabric of time, causing anomalies and ripples throughout history. Faced with the repercussions of tampering with time, Tony panics and accidentally sends himself back to the age of 17. As a younger-version of himself, Tony desperately attempts to stabilize time and prevent further damage. He realizes the importance of living in the present, understanding that the good memories will stay with him, but that is not where life always exists. Along the way, he encounters his childhood friend, Jonathan, who had died in an accident. Through his interactions with him, Tony slowly begins to understand the impact of trying to change the past and the powerful role of fate. Seeing his parents alive and happy stirs up mixed emotions for Tony, but he becomes more determined to return to his 25-year-old reality, to the people he loves, especially Sarah. His constant wistfulness for the past has compromised his cherished relationships, and he now understands that he must embrace the present and the future. Using his advanced knowledge of the time machine, Tony successfully fixes the anomalies and travels back to the exact moment of his 25th birthday party. He is greeted by his friends and family, who have no recollection of the events that had transpired, but only Sarah, who somehow remembers everything. With her warm embrace, Tony resolves to make the most of his life from now on and discards the time machine, focusing on building a life together with Sarah. Chasing Time is a tale about self-discovery and self-acceptance. Set against the backdrop of inventive science fiction elements, the film explores the notion of living in the moment and learning to appreciate the value of relationships and the passage of time. It serves as a poignant reminder to cherish the present and continue moving forward, no matter how much we may yearn for the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As a young girl, she appeared on several Blue Peter items, with no indication given on-screen that she was Ellis's daughter. She attended St. Stephen's School and later Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Her third album, Trip the Light Fantastic, was released in May 2007 and debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. Fred Schneider of The B-52s, Richard Barone (formerly of The Bongos), Shelly Poole (formerly of Alisha's Attic), Cathy Dennis and Kerin Smith (formerly of Theaudience) contributed to produce an album of disco-pop music.

We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going.

The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

Article:","completion":"Title: Doctor in Trouble for Slapping Patients and Talking Inappropriately Once upon a time, there was a doctor named Michael Clarke who was 47 years old. He was an orthopedic surgeon, which means he's a doctor who helps fix broken bones. Dr. Clarke was very good at his job, especially when it came to fixing hips. He worked in a hospital called Syracuse hospital. One day, some people found out that Dr. Clarke did some really bad things when his patients were fast asleep. You see, when people get surgery, they sometimes have to take special medicine called anesthesia to help them sleep so they won't feel any pain during the operation. Dr. Clarke would test if his patients were really asleep by winding his arm and slapping them on their backsides! He said he did this to see if the anesthesia was working, but other doctors and nurses said they had never seen anyone do this before. Not only did he do this to his patients, he also talked about inappropriate things with the staff in the surgery room. He talked about graphic and icky things that made people feel very uncomfortable and upset. When the hospital found out about these things that Dr. Clarke was doing, they didn't do anything to stop him. That was not good because now the hospital is also in trouble for not helping the patients. Today, Dr. Clarke is being investigated. That means people are trying to find out if he did even more bad things and if he should get in a lot of trouble.

You can stick to the daily recommended amount of water during your water fast. Choose the purest water you can, or drink distilled water. Don’t drink all that water at once! Spread out your water consumption throughout the day. Try setting out three 1-liter jugs every day, so you can see how much water you should drink. Don’t drink more water than the recommended amount, as this can throw off the balance of salt and minerals in your body and cause health problems. If you get strong hunger pangs, work through it by drinking 1-2 glasses of water. Then lie down and rest. The craving will usually pass. You can also try distracting yourself by reading or meditating. Break your fast with orange or lemon juice first. Then proceed to add foods to your diet gradually.

This formula signifies that a molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms (H2) and one oxygen atom (O). The term comes from \\"hydrogen\\" and \\"oxygen\\", the two elements that make up water, and was first used in the late 19th century. Water is a vital compound for all forms of life. It covers about 70% of the Earth's surface and it makes up about 60% of our body weight. It plays a crucial part in a variety of natural processes, including weather systems, the water cycle, and the support of life. Water is known as a universal solvent due to its polar nature, which means it dissolves more substances than any other liquid, contributing to the transport of nutrients in the environment and within our bodies. As mentioned in the provided paragraph, many things dissolve in water and specific types of rocks even completely dissolve in it. Additionally, other minerals can change or even transmute by adding water into their structure.

Here is a question about this article: The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: jordan doesnt give up B: pessimistic about the dog being found C: optimistic about finding the cat A:","completion":"After searching high and low for his lost puppy and not being able to find it, Jordan would most likely feel a mix of emotions. Considering the options given, the most accurate answer to the question according to the context would be: B: Pessimistic about the dog being found. The reasoning behind this choice can be explained through a thorough analysis of each option provided: A: Jordan doesn't give up - This option suggests that Jordan is persistent and not easily deterred. Even though these qualities could be true, the answer does not directly address how Jordan would feel in the situation presented in the context. It more so focuses on Jordan's behavior or actions instead of his emotions. B: Pessimistic about the dog being found - Pessimism refers to an outlook that anticipates negative outcomes or events. Given that Jordan could not find his lost puppy after searching extensively, it is natural for him to feel disheartened. This in turn could make him feel pessimistic about his chances of ever finding the dog. This answer aligns more closely with the context and addresses Jordan's emotional state in the aftermath of his unsuccessful search. C: Optimistic about finding the cat - This option not only deviates from the context by introducing a cat instead of a lost puppy, but it also does not address what Jordan's emotions would be after not finding his lost pet. Additionally, if Jordan were optimistic, it would seem more likely to be about finding the dog and not a cat. Thus, upon careful examination, option B: pessimistic about the dog being found, best describes how Jordan would most likely feel after his unsuccessful search for his lost puppy, according to the context provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned less about wolves? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"Fox learned less about wolves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles. and a hint : No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Please answer this question : Which particle would have higher temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","completion":"Particle A would have a higher temperature than particle B. This is because temperature in physics is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. The faster a particle moves, the more kinetic energy it possesses. In the given situation, David is teaching the children that particle A moves faster than particle B. As a result, particle A would have more kinetic energy compared to particle B. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, particle A would exhibit a higher temperature compared to particle B. Consequently, particle A would feel warmer than particle B. To make this concept more relatable for the children, David could use everyday examples such as a hot cup of tea and an ice cube. The tea feels hot because the particles in it are moving fast, possessing more kinetic energy and thus exhibiting a higher temperature. On the other hand, the particles in the ice cube are moving slower, with less kinetic energy, resulting in a lower temperature and feeling cooler to the touch. To further clarify the relationship between the speed of particles and their temperature, David could introduce the concept of thermal energy transfer. When two objects at different temperatures come into contact, thermal energy (heat) transfers from the object with a higher temperature to the object with a lower temperature. This transfer occurs due to the movement of particles: faster-moving particles (with more kinetic energy) transfer some of their energy to the slower-moving particles (with less kinetic energy), causing the objects to eventually reach an equilibrium temperature. In conclusion, in the given situation, particle A would have a higher temperature than particle B, since it moves faster and possesses more kinetic energy. By using real-world examples, David can effectively teach the children about the relationship between particle movement, kinetic energy, and temperature, and how thermal energy transfer occurs between particles at different temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sponsored Stories, the social ads that are currently restricted to the right-hand side of the page, will start appearing in your news feed at a rate of not more than one per day. The stories will all relate to your friends or pages you “like,” such as a friend “liking” a company’s page, playing a game app, or checking in at a business. Reactions: This is basically “the holy grail for advertisers,” writes Josh Constine on TechCrunch, because the ads will appear directly alongside “organic social content”—and will look very similar to that content. Though some users are sure to be “outraged”—there’s no way to opt out of having your activity used in these ads—Constine notes that social ads are much more relevant to users than traditional ads. Facebook probably won’t stop with the News Feed, the CEO of a social-engagement ad firm tells Ad Age. Ultimately, he predicts, the social networking site will deliver similar ads on third-party sites or streaming TV shows. \\"We really see Facebook becoming the operating system of the internet for ad delivery in the future,\\" he says. This plan is a surefire money-maker for Facebook and a “boon for advertisers,” as Sponsored Stories are sure to have “much higher click-through rates and conversions than units on the side of the page,” writes Brittany Darwell on Inside Facebook. And while some will probably be frustrated by the move, it likely won’t change “how most people use the site.” Expand this summary.","completion":"In the coming months, Facebook News Feed will begin to display ads through an update that includes Sponsored Stories - social ads that are currently restricted to the right-hand side of the platform.

Integrating ads with organic social content is seen as the \\"holy grail for advertisers,\\" according to TechCrunch writer Josh Constine. The prime advantage is that social ads have the potential to be much more relevant to users than traditional advertisements. Although there is no way for users to opt out of having their activity included in Sponsored Stories, the high degree of personalization these ads offer is likely to make them more attractive to users. Despite the anticipated backlash from some users who may feel outraged by the inability to opt out, the integration of Sponsored Stories into the news feed is expected to become the standard, and may not drastically change how most people use the site. Facebook is likely to expand this advertising model beyond the News Feed, according to the CEO of a social-engagement ad firm speaking with Ad Age. He predicts that Facebook may eventually deliver similar advertisements on third-party websites or streaming TV shows, further reinforcing the platform's role as the \\"operating system of the internet for ad delivery in the future.\\" Incorporating Sponsored Stories into the news feed represents a lucrative opportunity for advertisers and Facebook alike. As Brittany Darwell of Inside Facebook points out, these stories will likely yield higher click-through rates and conversion rates than their counterparts located on the side of the page.

Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews. The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework. The great majority of American Protestants, both clergy and laity, strongly supported the independence movement. All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany). The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document. The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition.

It is at the mouth of four major rivers, being the Severn, Wye, Usk and Avon, and other smaller rivers. Its high tidal range of about means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. - The Massachusetts Bay Colony (16281691) was an English settlement on the east coast of North America in the 17th century in and around the broad opening of Massachusetts Bay, the northernmost predecessor colony of the several colonies later reorganized as the \\"Province of Massachusetts Bay\\". The lands of the settlement were located in central New England in what is now Massachusetts, with initial settlements situated on two natural harbors and surrounding land, about apartthe areas around the present-day cities of Salem and Boston. The territory nominally administered by the colony included much of present-day central New England, including portions of the U.S. states of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Territory claimed but never administered by the colonial government extended as far west as the Pacific Ocean. The earlier Dutch colony of New Netherlands disputed many of these claims, arguing that they held rights to lands beyond Rhode Island up to the western side of Cape Cod and the Plymouth Bay Colony. - There are more than 30 islands in the Bay; the three largest ones are Aquidneck Island, Conanicut Island, and Prudence Island. Bodies of water that are part of Narragansett Bay include the Sakonnet River, Mount Hope Bay, and the southern, tidal part of the Taunton River.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson.

His 2001 asylum-themed collection, for example, culminated with a fleshy, nude woman reclining in a glass cube, breathing through tubes connected to a face mask as large live moths fluttered around her. So it’s reasonable to think he would have approved of a new project based, literally, on his life. Tina Gorjanc, who is just finishing the material futures program at McQueen’s alma mater, London’s famous fashion school Central Saint Martins, is working on a project that will use McQueen’s DNA to grow skin, which she plans to tan and turn into leather jackets and bags. The skin will even bear tattoos based on the exact “locations, size, and design,” of McQueen’s, she says. Tina Gorjanc “Love looks not with the eyes, / But with the mind” The lab manipulated the genes that control freckles and moles as well, and the skin can get sunburned. “With the tattoos and manipulation of freckles and sunburning, I wanted to showcase the material,” Gorjanc explains. “I think that was really important in terms of getting this connection between the jacket and McQueen.” Recently she presented her “Pure Human” project in an exhibition, using products made of pig skin to show what the final items could look like. Gorjanc’s project is intended to raise questions about how corporations might one day exploit genetic information for luxury goods, and to showcase how little protection exists for a person’s DNA. In May, she filed an application to patent, as she describes it, “bioengineered genetic material that is grown in the lab using tissue-engineering technology and the process of de-extinction.” De-extinction allows you to extract genetic material from a deceased source. She’s not able to patent McQueen’s DNA itself, but says if she is granted the patent, she would “have ownership of this material that includes Alexander McQueen’s genetic information.” She also filed a second patent for the process, separate from any connection to McQueen. Though she has been approached by some who want to produce the items for sale, Gorjanc says the finished products would more likely be displayed in a gallery. She would consider selling them to a collector, but is more focused on the technology, which might be useful in creating sustainable, lab-grown leather that doesn’t require slaughtering animals. The DNA to grow the human skin will come from McQueen’s hair, which he used in his 1992 collection, “Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims.” It referenced the Victorian era, when prostitutes would sell locks of their hair that people would purchase to give to their lovers. McQueen confirmed in interviews that it was his own hair he used, and Gorjanc spoke to a friend and model of McQueen’s who was with him when he put the hair in the labels, so she says she’s reasonably sure it is authentic. The institution that owns the collection—she wouldn’t say which it is—has agreed to give her a sample of the hair. Tina Gorjanc One day, this might be made from genuine McQueen skin. Gorjanc, who has a long fascination with biotechnology, got the idea for the project after reading about the case of Henrietta Lacks, a poor, black tobacco farmer in the US whose cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951. Those cells have since been vital to medical research on everything from the polio vaccine to cloning. Her story was told by Rebecca Skloot in the hugely popular book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Tina Gorjanc Backpack with freckles and moles. Gorjanc also found out that luxury companies are investing in bioengineering, though she says it’s mostly for the purpose of testing cosmetics on skin and to reduce animal testing. How much ownership a person has over their genetic information is still a fuzzy area of law. In 1984, for instance, a doctor in the US patented a cell line derived from the tissue of a man named John Moore. Moore, who didn’t know his tissue was being used, lost his legal battle to win the rights to the patent. Glenn Cohen, an expert on the intersection of bioethics and law at Harvard Law School, says it’s “very common” for researchers to take tissue and use it for research. These days, however, patients are usually asked to sign a form agreeing to give away those biospecimens and relinquish any commercial interest, he says. In the US, you also have no ownership of “abandoned” tissue, such as hair left on the floor after a haircut, though again, nobody can patent the DNA itself. Ownership law in the UK is even less stringent. “The standard rule in the UK is that there’s no ownership property right of human tissue,” says Dr. Jeff Skopek, a lecturer in medical law, ethics, and policy at University of Cambridge. “So McQueen didn’t own his hair, technically. That’s what’s called the ‘common law property rule.'” Gorjanc says she consulted with a patent attorney, and that what she’s doing is “completely legal.” But she, or anyone else in the UK attempting to use a deceased person’s DNA, likely faces legal challenges, according to Skopek. The UK’s Human Tissue Act, for instance, often demands a person give informed consent before their tissues can be used. McQueen did not in this case. Gorjanc may need approval from a research ethics committee. The Data Protection Act might also apply. There’s more leeway if the tissue is anonymous, but in this case, it is very much not. Vic Philips, Single Malt Teapot Displaying the goods. Though Gorjanc says she has been in touch with the Alexander McQueen brand, the company says it did not have prior knowledge of the project. “Contrary to some press reports the company wasn’t approached about this project nor have we ever endorsed it,” a spokesperson said. McQueen had no children, though his father and five siblings (paywall) survived him. Gorjanc says she did get some feedback from those who knew McQueen. “People that were really close to him or that worked for his institution said that he might actually like the idea,” she says. “He was always pushing the boundaries and always trying to break laws in fashion.” An earlier version of this story quoted Gorjanc saying she spoke with the Alexander McQueen label about the project and got a positive reaction. Quartz had reached out to the label but had not received a reply at publication time. After this story was published, the company reached out to say that Gorjanc had never approached them about the project. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"So, imagine there's a person named Alexander McQueen who was a famous fashion designer, but he's not with us anymore. There's another person named Tina Gorjanc who is a student at a school for fancy fashion design, and she's doing a very special project. Tina came up with an idea to use a little part of McQueen, his hair, to create something new and interesting. With the help of science, she wants to grow a kind of skin from McQueen's hair and then turn it into leather that can be made into jackets and bags. The special part is that the leather would have tattoos, freckles, and even get sunburned like McQueen's real skin! The aim of this project is not just to make cool things with McQueen's skin, but also to make people think about how our personal information, like our DNA, can be used in the future, and to explore the possibility of creating leather in labs so that no animals have to be hurt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A prologue explains the role of the bounty hunter. A wanted criminal named Burch tries to ambush bounty hunter Jim Kipp, but Kipp gets the better of him. Kipp takes Burch's corpse into town to collect the reward. A representative of the Pinkerton Detective Agency asks Kipp to hunt a trio of fugitives. Three masked men committed a robbery and fled with 100,000. Kipp, who has the reputation that he will do anything for money, is offered a huge reward if he can capture the culprits dead or alive. Kipp rides into the town of Twin Forks, and uses an alias. He seeks information about one fugitive's wounds from Dr. Spencer, who is wary of revealing too much. Kipp is immediately attracted to the doctor's daughter, Julie. A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter. Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known.

Question: You are given a new situation: Eric is driving on a highway. His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit. After a short way he pulls into a parking lot reaching his destination. and a hint : A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. Please answer this question : Given a car is accelerating, is it being acted upon by a balanced or unbalanced force? Answer:","completion":"Given a car is accelerating, it is being acted upon by an unbalanced force. Justification: Acceleration occurs when there is a change in velocity, which could be due to speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. In the situation, Eric lets up on the gas pedal, which causes the car to slow down, and then he makes a left turn, changing the car's direction. Both of these actions indicate acceleration, which means an unbalanced force is acting upon the car. A balanced force would result in no change in velocity, meaning the car would maintain its speed and direction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the context: Why did Casey do this? A:","completion":"Casey asked about the strange car parked near her home yesterday due to a combination of curiosity, concern, and a sense of responsibility for her surroundings. 1. Curiosity: As human beings are naturally curious creatures, it is normal for people to question anything out of the ordinary. Casey may have observed the unfamiliar car in a place where it did not belong and wanted to know the reason for its presence. This curiosity could stem from a simple desire to learn more about what is happening in her environment and keep herself informed. 2. Concern: Another reason for Casey's inquiry could be her concern for the safety and well-being of herself and those around her. The sudden presence of an unknown vehicle might have raised suspicion that something was amiss or that someone might be trespassing on her property. In this case, Casey would want to identify the owner or purpose of the vehicle to determine if it posed a potential threat, or if it was merely a harmless coincidence. 3. Sense of responsibility: As a member of a community or neighborhood, one often feels a sense of responsibility to stay aware of and involved in the events happening around them – especially when it comes to safety and security. Casey might have felt it was her responsibility to find out about the strange car and address any potential issues it might represent. By doing so, she could contribute to maintaining a secure and peaceful community. 4. Protecting personal property: If the strange car was parked on or near Casey's property, her interest could be driven by a desire to protect her assets. Seeing an unfamiliar vehicle so close to home might have made her worry about potential theft or vandalism. In this case, Casey would be asking the question to ensure her property and belongings are safe, as well as monitor any potential neighborhood threats. 5. Social connection: Finally, Casey might have asked about the strange car to establish or maintain connections with her neighbors or community members. Expressing concern or curiosity about an unusual situation can create opportunities for conversation and strengthen ties among neighbors. By seeking information about the vehicle, she could be engaging with others and solidifying her position within the community as someone who is invested, attentive, and proactive. In conclusion, Casey's decision to ask about the strange car parked near her home can be attributed to several factors. Her desire to satisfy her curiosity, her concern for her safety, and her sense of responsibility towards her community all play a role in prompting her to seek more information about the situation. This shows that she is attentive and proactive in keeping herself and her surroundings safe and secure while maintaining social connections within her community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Gothic architecture: Increasing military and cultural contacts with the Muslim world, including the Norman conquest of Islamic Sicily in 1090, the Crusades, beginning 1096, and the Islamic presence in Spain, may have influenced Medieval Europe's adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial. Certainly, in those parts of the Western Mediterranean subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing Romanesque and later Gothic traditions with Islamic decorative forms, as seen, for example, in Monreale and Cefalù Cathedrals, the Alcázar of Seville, and Teruel Cathedral.

Title: Tristan & Isolde Movie plot: A gripping tale of two young lovers whose forbidden love crosses the boundaries of rival kingdoms and marital commitment. At the film's commencement, Britain is at war with Ireland, and the English lords and barons are seeking to form an alliance to overturn the ruthless Irish king, Donnchadh. However, on the night they are to sign treaties to unite their kingdom, the Irish penetrate the Castle Tantallion, slaughtering all but a few of the English. Among these is young Tristan of Eragon, whose life is saved by Lord Marke, Britain's only promising leader remaining.As Tristan enters his young adult years, having been raised and nurtured by Lord Marke, he uses his sharpened knowledge and cunning battle skills to fight bravely against the Irish when they cross into the Land of Cornwall. Though he defeats their strongest warrior, Morholt, he suffers a fatal strike of poison, and is presumed dead with his fellow martyrs.

Part of being self-reliant is undertaking certain responsibilities that enable people to experience independence. Doing simple things such as paying your bills on time, cleaning up after yourself if you make a mess, and going to work or school on time can help you feel more responsible and self-reliant. If you do not have a job, you have the responsibility of looking for a job, seeking education that will lead to employment, or starting your own business. Information is power, so having information will give you the power to make your own decisions and assert your independence. Try to be well-rounded and keep up with information about what is going on in your place of business or school, your town, your state, your country, and the world. For example, knowing that a local ordinance determining whether backyard chickens can be kept in your area is coming up for a vote can give you the opportunity to lobby and vote for the ability to keep chickens for fresh eggs. You should have a sense of direction. Something has to drive you. For example, if you are attending college, you should at least have an idea of what you want to do after college and what you are passionate about studying. You should also try to set goals for yourself. Try setting short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, then be realistic about what you need to do to meet those goals. Seek out a career counselor if you are not sure what you’d like to do with your life. Career self-assessments can be found online. Many websites like this one or this one can offer helpful guidance. Most schools have career centers or guidance counselors available to all enrolled students. These resources can help you shape a vision for your future. Allowing people to make your decisions for you is essentially giving up your independence and self-reliance. Assert yourself and make decisions for yourself based on your goals and dreams. While it is important to be considerate towards other people, it is not necessary to give up your ability to make your own decisions. For example, if you are looking for a place to live with a roommate, be sure you are making decisions based on what is best for you. If you prefer to rent a house and have a bit more independence than an apartment building, stick to your preference and do not allow your roommate to talk you into something that you don’t want to do. It can also be common for some people to allow their spouses or significant others to make all the decisions in their relationship, from where to go out to eat to where to live and what kind of car to buy. Changing the dynamic of such a relationship may strain the relationship, but having a part in the decision making at both daily and long-term levels can give you greater control of your life.

Answer the following question: Question: what is phylum cnidaria I found the following answer on Google: Recent analyses have concluded that cnidarians, although considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians, have a wider range of genes. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement that cnidarians are considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians and have a wider range of genes is correct, but it does not provide a comprehensive definition of what phylum Cnidaria is. Let me provide a more detailed explanation of the phylum Cnidaria. Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic animals found in both marine and freshwater environments, with over 10,000 known species. The name Cnidaria is derived from the Greek word \\"cnidos,\\" which means \\"stinging nettle,\\" referring to the stinging cells (cnidocytes) present in these animals. Cnidarians include familiar organisms such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydrozoans. Characteristics of phylum Cnidaria: 1. Radial symmetry: Cnidarians have radial symmetry, which means their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis. This is in contrast to bilaterians, which have bilateral symmetry (a distinct left and right side). 2. Diploblastic body structure: Cnidarians have a simple body plan with two germ layers, the ectoderm (outer layer) and the endoderm (inner layer), surrounding a jelly-like substance called mesoglea. This diploblastic structure is considered more \\"primitive\\" compared to the triploblastic structure (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) found in bilaterians. 3. Cnidocytes: A major feature of cnidarians is their stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are used for prey capture and defense. Each cnidocyte contains a coiled, thread-like structure called a nematocyst, which can be ejected when the cell is triggered. 4. Nerve net: Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a diffuse network of nerve cells spread throughout the body. They lack a centralized nervous system or brain. 5. Polyp and medusa life stages: Cnidarians typically exhibit two distinct body forms - the sessile polyp stage and the free-swimming medusa stage. Some species have only one of these forms in their life cycle, while others alternate between the two forms. Regarding the statement about the range of genes, recent molecular and genomic studies have indeed shown that cnidarians possess a diverse array of genes, many of which were previously thought to be unique to bilaterians. This has led to new insights into the early evolution of multicellular animals, and has prompted a reconsideration of the \\"primitive\\" label applied to cnidarians. In summary, phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic animals with a diploblastic body plan, radial symmetry, and specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes. They are considered more \\"primitive\\" than bilaterians, but recent research has revealed a wider range of genes in cnidarians than previously thought, which has important implications for our understanding of early animal evolution."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's go through the steps to understand and compare the oxygen levels in both zones: Step 1: Understand the concept of a dead zone A dead zone is an area in a body of water with significantly reduced oxygen levels, which makes it difficult for certain aquatic species to survive. This condition is often caused by nutrient pollution from sources such as agricultural runoff, leading to excessive algae growth that consumes oxygen when it decomposes. Step 2: Examine Zone A Zone A is a lake near agricultural lands that has been declared as a dead zone. This implies that the oxygen levels in this lake are significantly low due to the factors mentioned in Step 1. Step 3: Examine Zone B Zone B is a lake near a national park that has not been declared as a dead zone. This suggests that the oxygen levels in this lake are likely to be higher than those in a dead zone, which means that the lake can support diverse aquatic life. Step 4: Compare the oxygen levels Since Zone A is a dead zone with significantly reduced oxygen levels, and Zone B is a non-dead zone which implies it has comparatively higher oxygen levels, we can conclude: Answer: Zone B would have more oxygen than Zone A."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that helps Reacher escort the young girl to a private school? from the following article ? After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor. Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are. They discard the phone and make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals a backpack from one of the students to use the credit cards.

Question: Chuck and Larry travel to what country? Title: I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry Movie plot: In New York City in a Local Brooklyn Fire Station, there are lots of firefighters. Charles 'Chuck' Levine (Who is a chronic womanizer) and Lawrence 'Larry' Valentine (Who is a bachelor and trying to raise his children after his wife passed away some time ago) are two veteran New York City Firefighters. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses and Chuck almost dies. Larry rescues Chuck by shielding him from the falling debris. As he and Larry awaken at a hospital later, Chuck vows to repay his debt in any way possible. The incident prompts Larry to realize the fact that death can come for him at any moment, but he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance policy. Larry was given at least a year to change his beneficiaries but he was profusely mourning his wife, and left it too late. However, One of the ways suggested for him to do so is to get married. Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although at first Chuck declines, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees.Chuck and Larry become domestic partners and Chuck becomes Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. Soon, New York City investigators arrive to inquire about their partnership. They lie to the investigator by saying that they are really in love with each other and insist they've been having \\"Loads of Sex, Gay-crazy sex, Man on Man, Loving Every Minute\\". Chuck and Larry then decide to enlist the help of a lawyer, Alex McDonough, who suggests that they get married. Chuck and Larry then marry in Canada and move in together. When they get married in Canada, the Asian minister who proclaims \\"I Now Pronounce You, 'Husband and Husband, You May Now Kiss The Husband\\" is shocked to see Chuck and Larry slap each other the cheek (as opposed to kissing) when ordered to \\"Kiss the Husband\\".

Some smaller sediments can still be carried by a slow moving stream or river. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep. Alluvial Fans In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land. The stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form an alluvial fan. Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. Question: \\"What type of feature is formed when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and the stream comes to a rapid stop?\\" Response: \\"Alluvial fan\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. An alluvial fan is the type of feature formed when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and the stream comes to a rapid stop. During this process, sediments are deposited in a fan-shaped pattern as the water slows down and loses its ability to carry those sediments. These alluvial fans are generally found in desert environments at the base of steep mountain ranges, where there is a significant change in slope which causes the fast-flowing water to lose its velocity and spread out. The formation of an alluvial fan is a result of deposition, which is the process through which sediment particles, such as sand, gravel, and silt, are dropped by the running water, as the water's interaction with the mountainous terrain leads to a change in speed and direction. As the slope decreases, sediment sizes gradually reduce, and this leads to the characteristic fan-shaped appearance of an alluvial fan. In the case of deltas, which were mentioned earlier, they are another type of feature associated with deposition. They form when a river empties its sediments into a larger body of water, such as an ocean or a lake, and they are shaped like a triangle. Both delta and alluvial fan formations result from the same physical process: deposition of sediments carried by a flowing water body as it encounters a change in slope or merges with a larger body of standing water. In conclusion, alluvial fans are formed as a result of deposition when mountain streams in arid regions flow onto flatter land and come to a rapid stop, ultimately leading to the dropping of sediments in a fan-shaped pattern. They are significant geological features that can provide valuable insights into the sedimentary history and environmental changes of a particular region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard.

Moisture is what causes cast iron cookware to rust, so it's important you store cast iron pots and pans somewhere dry.","completion":"If you live in a humid climate, it's even more crucial to select a storage location with low humidity levels to prolong the life of your cast iron cookware. Once you have identified the ideal dry area in your kitchen or pantry, follow these steps to properly store your cast iron pieces: 1. Clean and dry your cookware: First, thoroughly clean your cast iron cookware with warm water and a gentle scrubber or brush. Avoid using soap, as it can remove the seasoning on your cookware that prevents rust. Dry your pieces with a clean towel or cloth thoroughly and then place them on the stovetop or in a warm oven to ensure they are fully dry before storage. 2. Apply a light layer of oil: After your cast iron is clean and completely dry, apply a very thin layer of oil (such as vegetable oil or flaxseed oil) to the entire surface using a soft cloth or paper towel. This step offers additional protection against rust. 3. Stack and store your cookware: Cast iron cookware is heavy, so store your pots and pans on the bottom shelf to avoid potential damage to cabinets or countertops. For skillets, store them on their own with no other items on top, or nest them inside one another if they are of different sizes, with a layer of parchment paper or a towel in between to prevent scratching. Dutch ovens can be stored with the lids slightly ajar, or use a paper towel, cloth, or silicone trivet to create a small gap between the pot and the lid for adequate air circulation. 4. Be mindful of hooks and wall mounts: While many people like to hang their cast iron cookware on hooks or wall mounts, ensure that the hooks are strong enough to hold the weight of the cookware without bending or breaking. It is also essential to protect the cast iron surfaces from scratching during storage by using a cloth or rubber protector where the hook or mount comes into contact with the cookware. 5. Perform regular maintenance: Periodically inspect your cast iron cookware for any signs of rust or damage. When detected early, small rust spots can often be removed and re-seasoned without major issues. Additionally, make it a habit to occasionally re-oil your cast iron cookware to make sure it stays well protected during storage. In conclusion, properly storing your cast iron cookware in a dry area, performing regular maintenance, and following the steps outlined above will help prolong the life and performance of your cherished pieces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A survivalist suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins and evading law enforcement for years had this to say to police finally caught up with him on Wednesday: 'Good job, you got me.' Troy James Knapp, 45, made the remarks Wednesday as he threw his rifle on the ground, ending a 50-man operation to capture him in the mountains outside of Ferron in central Utah, the Sanpete County Sheriff's Office said. Knapp was finally apprehended after allegedly firing shots at a police helicopter, pointing his gun at a sheriff, and leading authorities on a snowshoe chase, according to ABC News. Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah. Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers. Knapp has long been suspected of hiding. out in the mountains of southern Utah, shooting up and robbing dozens. of cabins over the past six years. Police say he's been living off the. comfort of cabins in winter and retreating to makeshift summer camps. deep in the forest with stolen guns and supplies. The operation to apprehend him was launched after two hunters ran into him on a trail last Friday. 'He was asking how much snow was up the trail further,' Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Curtis told ABCNews.com. 'Their dog was acting nervous and growling, and he said, \\"Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you guys.\\"' Knapp didn't identify himself, but called himself a 'mountain man.' After the encounter, the hunters alerted authorities. Finally caught: Troy James Knapp was arrested today, left, after evading cops for years. He was last arrested in 2001, right. Prior to last Friday, the last known. time Knapp was spotted was on October 1 last year by a surveillance. camera in Sanpete County. He had a gun slung over his shoulder and was using binoculars to scope. for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in. Iron, Kane and Garfield counties have all issued arrest warrants for Knapp on burglary and weapons charges. While there have been no violent confrontations with Knapp, authorities had feared he was a ticking time bomb. In custody: Snow-mobilers pass the sheriff's truck carrying the 45-year-old suspect. In 5th District Court in Iron County,. Knapp is facing four counts of burglary, a second-degree felony; theft,. a second-degree felony; and three counts of theft, a class B. misdemeanor - all charges for incidents spanning June 2009 through. September of 2011. He is suspected of leaving some. cabins riddled with bullet holes, defacing religious icons and writing. taunting notes for cabin owners and authorities. 'Hey Sheriff...Gonna put you in the ground!' one note said, according to court records. Records. indicate Knapp fell off the radar in 2002 when he apparently left. California in violation of his parole for a burglary conviction. He was charged with theft in 2000 in California, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison, according to records. Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last year in Sanpete County, Utah. Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist. As. a teenager, Knapp was convicted in Michigan of breaking and entering,. passing bad checks and unlawful flight from authorities, according to. court records in Kalamazoo County. His. most serious arrest for felony assault in Michigan was reduced in 1994. to a charge of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to. plead guilty. He has been compared to Davy. Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of. the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of. wilderness. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, pictured in December 2011. It is believed that he is responsible for a series of burglaries at holiday homes in the Utah wilderness. Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor. ‘This guy is probably about as true a. survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name. Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities. In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp. It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food,. alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. In. February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin. after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It. turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin. was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the. fingerprint match. Early on, investigators thought his. unattended camps they came across during their search were left. behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This. was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns,. radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a. name, but the man remains in the mist.

The enticing aroma of freshly baked cookies filled the air while I meticulously arranged them inside the jar. With a variety of shapes and flavors, my delightful cookie collection was a delight to behold. The first layer of cookies in the jar consisted of deliciously plump chocolate chip cookies, still warm from the oven. The rich aroma of cocoa and the exquisite taste of buttery and crumbly texture occupied each tiny morsel. Nestled amidst gooey chocolate chips, these classic cookies always had a knack for stealing my taste buds' attention. Next, I layered the jar with wonderfully crisp oatmeal cookies. Speckled with bits of raisins, they added just the right amount of natural sweetness into the mix, without being overwhelming. Each bite of the chewy treat evoked nostalgic feelings of home and quiet, cozy evenings spent devouring cookies and sipping on a warm mug of milk. Sugar cookies followed as the third layer, their light, golden hue perfectly contrasting the jar's other inhabitants. Rolled out into cute, whimsical shapes like hearts, stars, and flowers, they brought a touch of elegance to the collection. Sprinkled with a gentle dusting of sugar on top, they glittered dreamily in the soft light of my kitchen. For the fourth layer, I added a batch of double chocolate cookies, their decadent cocoa-infused batter and ample chocolate chips bestowing a rich, intense experience upon every fortunate taster. Nutty undertones graced these delectable marvels, catering to the needs of chocolate-lovers everywhere. Next, I placed the quintessential peanut butter cookies in the jar. Their signature crisscross pattern, made with a fork, added a touch of homemade charm. As I nestle each cookie into the jar, the enticingly nutty aroma further tantalized my senses, ensuring that not even the most stubborn cravings could resist these treats. Finally, I completed the jar with a selection of buttery shortbread cookies. Delicately crunchy and just sweet enough, the unassuming vanilla treats added a delightful touch of simplicity to the otherwise eclectic mix. Their hint of almond extract elevated the cookie's depth, making it a rich and comforting classic. Now, with the box completely empty and every delicious treat safely nestled within the transparent confines of the cookie jar, I placed the lid back on top. I stepped back to admire my handiwork, proud of the medley of cookies I've collected, each one a testament to the joy of baking.

Journey is an American rock band that formed in San Francisco in 1973, composed of former members of Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's eighth and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \\"Open Arms\\". Journey's album sales did not improve and Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman, with whom keyboardist Gregg Rolie could share lead vocal duties. The band hired Robert Fleischman and transitioned to a more popular style, akin to that of Foreigner and Boston. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977 and together the new incarnation of the band wrote the hit \\"Wheel in the Sky\\"; however, management differences resulted in Fleischman leaving within the year. In late 1977, Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, also hired Roy Thomas Baker as a producer to add a layered sound approach as Baker had done with his previous band, Queen. With their new lead singer and talented new producer, Journey released their fourth album, Infinity (1978). This album set Journey on their road to stardom with their first RIAA-certified platinum album. This album, with their hit song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" (#57 U.S.), set Journey on a new path with a more mainstream sound to make their highest chart success to date. In late 1978, manager Herbie Herbert fired drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who joined Bay Area rivals Jefferson Starship shortly thereafter. He was replaced by Berklee-trained jazz drummer Steve Smith. Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory recorded Evolution (1979), which gave the band their first Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 single, \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (#16); and Departure (1980), which reached No. 8 on the album charts. Journey's newfound success brought the band an almost entirely new fan base. During the 1980 Departure world tour, the band recorded a live album, Captured. Keyboardist Gregg Rolie then left the band, the second time in his career he left a successful act. Keyboardist Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman was brought in to record the lone studio track for Captured, \\"The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love),\\" but Rolie recommended pianist Jonathan Cain of The Babys as the permanent replacement. With Cain's replacement of Rolie's Hammond B-3 organ with his own synthesizers, the band was poised for a new decade in which they would achieve their greatest musical success.","completion":"This text is about Journey, an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1973.

Cost basis is the original value of an asset, such as stocks, bond, mutual funds. You begin with the original purchase price, and then you adjust it for commissions, stock splits, dividends, return of capital or any other transaction that affects the original value of the asset.","completion":"Understanding how to properly calculate cost basis is crucial for investors as it directly impacts the taxable gains or losses on the sale of the asset. A precise cost basis calculation not only ensures accurate tax reporting but also enables investors to make well-informed decisions when it comes to optimizing their investment strategies and minimizing their tax liabilities. The process of determining the cost basis of an asset involves several steps. First and foremost, make a note of the initial purchase price of the asset. This is the amount you paid for the asset including any purchase-related expenses such as commissions or transfer fees. Next, account for any transactions or corporate actions that modify the asset's original value. These events may include: 1. Stock splits: If you own a stock that underwent a split, you would need to adjust the cost basis accordingly. For example, if you purchased 100 shares of a company at 50 per share and experienced a 2-for-1 stock split, you would now own 200 shares with an adjusted cost basis of 25 per share. 2. Dividends and dividend reinvestments: When you receive a dividend, often you have the option to reinvest the dividends, which usually results in purchasing additional shares of the investment. These new shares acquired should be added to your cost basis accordingly. 3. Return of capital: Sometimes, companies return a portion of the invested capital to shareholders. This reduces the investment's cost basis by the amount of the return of capital. 4. Capital improvements: If you made any improvements or additions to the asset, you can adjust the cost basis by the cost of these upgrades. This is particularly relevant for real estate investments. 5. Mergers and acquisitions: When a company undergoes a merger or acquisition, the cost basis of your investment needs to be adjusted to account for any changes in the value of the shares. 6. Inheritance and gifted assets: If you inherit or receive a gift of an investment, the cost basis may need to be adjusted based on the fair market value at the time of inheritance or gifting, respectively. 7. Sale of a portion of your investment: If you sell a portion of your investment, you need to determine the cost basis of the sold shares based on the method you use to track the cost basis (e.g., average cost, specific identification, etc.) Once all relevant adjustments have been made, the final cost basis can be determined by summing up the adjusted purchase price and other amounts across all shares of the investment. Finally, when you decide to sell the asset, you can calculate your taxable gain or loss by subtracting the adjusted cost basis from the sale proceeds. Accurate calculation and record-keeping of your cost basis will ensure you are able to maximize your potential tax benefits and make informed strategic decisions relating to your investment portfolio."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: -bored -great -have a lot of receipts and bags The answer is:","completion":"Others will likely have a lot of receipts and bags. Given the context of Jesse going to the mall to buy expensive but fun gifts, it can be inferred that he intends to purchase numerous items for himself or for others. These gifts may be highly sought-after products or experiences that are indulgent or enjoyable in nature. Consequently, it can be deduced that other recipients of these gifts, or those accompanying Jesse, will reap the benefits of his shopping spree. As Jesse collects various items, there will naturally be an accumulation of receipts and bags from the stores he visits. These receipts may serve as records of transactions for personal finance purposes, or as necessary documentation for warranty or return policies. The bags will serve to carry the fun gifts and represent the outcome of Jesse's shopping undertaking. In addition to the material trappings of the shopping experience, the fun, luxurious, or coveted nature of these gifts will likely generate a sense of enjoyment and excitement amongst those who receive or partake in them. These interactions may foster deeper connections and showcase Jesse's thoughtfulness in selecting the perfect gifts for the recipients. Therefore, the ramifications of Jesse's shopping expedition extend beyond the mere accumulation of receipts and bags — they signify the cultivation and nurturing of relationships through the giving and receiving of special, memorable gifts.

The treatment of a leaky heart valve depends upon the severity of disease. For example : Aortic valve leak: in the case of an aortic valve leak, the severe leak can also be treated with blood pressure medicines known as vasodilators.","completion":"Absolutely, let me explain it to you like a fun story. When our heart has got a tiny leak (like a dripping faucet), our body and its team of fantastic doctors have different methods to fix it. It all depends on how big or small the leak is. Kind of like choosing between a big or small band-aid for a scratch. In our story, let's say the leak is from a door called the \\"Aortic Valve.\\" This door is really important because it lets the clean, oxygen-filled blood out of the heart to go on its journey to the rest of the body. When this door doesn't close properly and starts to leak, sometimes the blood doesn't flow correctly, and this can be a problem. If this happens, our body's team of doctors can give you special helper medicine called vasodilators. These vasodilators are like tiny superheroes that help to relax and open up the blood vessels, so it's easier for your blood to flow through them.

A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. A ribbon controller or other violin-like user interface may be used to control synthesizer parameters. The idea dates to Leon Theremin's 1922 first concept and his 1932 Fingerboard Theremin and Keyboard Theremin, Maurice Martenot's 1928 Ondes Martenot (sliding a metal ring), Friedrich Trautwein's 1929 Trautonium (finger pressure), and was also later utilized by Robert Moog. The ribbon controller has no moving parts. Instead, a finger pressed down and moved along it creates an electrical contact at some point along a pair of thin, flexible longitudinal strips whose electric potential varies from one end to the other. Older fingerboards used a long wire pressed to a resistive plate. A ribbon controller is similar to a touchpad, but a ribbon controller only registers linear motion. Although it may be used to operate any parameter that is affected by control voltages, a ribbon controller is most commonly associated with pitch bending. Fingerboard-controlled instruments include the Trautonium (1929), Hellertion (1929) and Heliophon (1936), Electro-Theremin (Tannerin, late 1950s), Persephone (2004), and the Swarmatron (2004). A ribbon controller is used as an additional controller in the Yamaha CS-80 and CS-60, the Korg Prophecy and Korg Trinity series, the Kurzweil synthesizers, Moog synthesizers, and others. Rock musician Keith Emerson used it with the Moog modular synthesizer from 1970 onward. In the late 1980s, keyboards in the synth lab at Berklee College of Music were equipped with membrane thin ribbon style controllers that output MIDI. They functioned as MIDI managers, with their programming language printed on their surface, and as expression/performance tools. Designed by Jeff Tripp of Perfect Fretworks Co., they were known as Tripp Strips. Such ribbon controllers can serve as a main MIDI controller instead of a keyboard, as with the Continuum instrument.","completion":"This text is about synthesizers, electronic musical instruments that generate electric signals to produce sound.

We have this equation: 40 * q - 4788 = 92 * q - 78 * q - 12 * q First, we need to combine the terms with q on the right side of the equation. So, let's add the numbers with q together: 92 * q - 78 * q - 12 * q = (92 - 78 - 12) * q = 2 * q Now our equation looks like this: 40 * q - 4788 = 2 * q Now, we need to move \\"2 * q\\" to the left side of the equation.

Hypothesis: The trees are all dead. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclusively affirm the presented hypothesis - \\"The trees are all dead\\" - based solely on the given premise, which states that \\"A logger is cutting down a large tree trunk in barren woods.\\" Let's dissect this further: 1. Description Analysis: The premise details an action involving a logger who is engaged in the process of cutting down a large tree trunk situated in a barren woods. The term \\"barren\\" typically denotes a lack of vegetation or perhaps the absence of typically expected or prior existing life. However, \\"barren\\" doesn't necessarily mean that all trees are dead. A forest can become barren due to several reasons such as seasonal change, pest infection or simply because it is a type of forest that does not contain many trees. However, those trees existing, though few, might still be live trees. 2. Action Inferred: The fact that the logger is cutting down a large tree could suggest several things. It could be inferred that the tree is dead, and thus is being removed. However, it could be a healthy tree being logged for wood, a common practice in forest management and wood industry. Let’s not forget that logging of live trees is a regular activity in the wood industry and it does not exclusively deal with dead trees. So, the presence of a logger could mean a healthy tree is being cut down for its wood, rather than it being dead. 3. Definitive Assumption: The conclusion that all trees are dead is an extreme blanket statement. Assuming that all the trees are dead because a logger is cutting down one tree might be an overreach. Just because a tree in a forest is being cut down does not definitively suggest that all trees in the area are dead. Many healthy forests are sustainably maintained by carefully managing and culling trees. While it's understandable why one might conclude that the observed logging activity could correlate with a preponderance of dead trees, it's necessary to remember that any conclusion must be drawn carefully by taking into account all available data. The current information provided does not support the broad inference that all trees are dead. To establish such a hypothesis irrefutably, more specific information demonstrating the death of all trees would be required, such as visible signs of disease on multiple trees, complete absence of leaves on all trees beyond normal seasonal shedding, or expert commentary on the health of the forest. In summary, the premise does not provide ample evidence to conclude that all trees are dead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(Photo: San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department) Sheriff's officials in San Bernardino County say a Joshua Tree couple kept their three children malnourished and living in a room-sized box for the past four years. While conducting an area check Wednesday morning, deputies noticed a travel trailer that appeared to be abandoned and a large rectangular box made of plywood in the 7000 block of Sunfair Road in Joshua Tree.

Lasagna The parents, Daniel Panico, 73, and Mona Kirk, 51, were arrested and booked into the Morongo Basin Jail on charges of willful cruelty to a child. Their bail was set at 100,000. The children, ages 11, 13 and 14, were found at the property. Deputies determined that for about four years the children had been living in the box, which is about 20 feet long, 10 feet wide and 4 feet tall. The children did not have enough food and were living in unsafe conditions, officials said.

(Photo: San Bernadino County Sheriff's Department) Children and Family Services responded to the property and took custody of the children. The structure where the children were living is on a mostly empty dirt road, two blocks off Highway 62, in the large span of open desert between Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms. Satellite imagery of the address shows a single white trailer, a few cars and what appears to be large piles of discarded trash surrounding the home. Most of the adjacent lots are empty, but it appears that at least one neighbor lives in a house, surrounded by a fence, directly across the street. The house is about eight miles from the front gate of Joshua Tree National Park and two miles east of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Station. Neighbor Mike Reynolds said the family moved in about four years ago. The father owned the land and the trailer and talked about building his dream home on the property, Reynolds said. “He was a regular retired guy, and an intelligent man,” Reynolds said. Several of his neighbors live “off the grid” so the family not having electricity or running water didn’t strike Reynolds as odd. The children seemed healthy and happy, Reynolds added. He noted he never saw any cats wandering around. He also suggested people wait for more information before passing judgment on the family. Reynolds believes the father kept the family from being homeless by building their home himself. “This guy was doing the best he could to raise his family,” Reynolds said. “If I was in his shoes and that’s all I could afford to raise my family and keep them alive — I have seen so much worse.” Reporter Brett Kelman contributed.

MORE NEWS: Turpin home has become a tourist attraction six weeks after their children were rescued Read or Share this story: http://desert.sn/2FHiwaR ||||| The Joshua Tree parents of three children, who were found to be living in a large wooden box, were arrested Wednesday morning on suspicion of willful cruelty to a child. A deputy was patrolling the rural area in the 7000 block of Sun Fair Road in Joshua Tree, saw a travel-trailer on a property that appeared to be abandoned and the rectangular plywood box, and checked it out, according to a San Bernardino County sheriff’s news release. The three children, ages 11, 13 and 14, reportedly lived in the large rectangular box — which was approximately 20 feet long by 4 feet high by 10 feet wide — for about four years. They didn’t have adequate food and were living in an unsuitable, unsafe environment due to the property conditions, the news release stated. The mother, Mona Kirk, 51, slept in the box with her children, while the father, Daniel Panico, 73, lived in the trailer or a vehicle, said Cindy Bachman, a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman, in an email. It’s not known where the children were living prior to living in the box. The box was a shelter fabricated out of scrap wood and other material, Bachman said. A tarp on top of the wooden structure kept the rain out, but there was no heat, running water, electricity or bathrooms. Photos of the location show old furniture, broken children’s toys, storage containers and other assorted junk strewn about the property. Bachman said she doesn’t believe the children were regularly attending school. They were not being locked in or held captive in the box. Several large holes and mounds of trash and human feces were found on the property, and about 30-40 cats were roaming freely inside the trailer. Children and Family Service responded to the scene and took custody of the children. The parents of the children, Kirk and Panico, were arrested on suspicion of willful cruelty to a child and booked into the Morongo Basin Jail in lieu of 100,000 bail each.

New York (CNN) -- When Gina Keatley first moved to New York to attend culinary school, she noticed that many of her neighbors were missing limbs. \\"I lived on 99th Street across from some projects,\\" she said. \\"I would walk to the train and think, 'Why are there so many amputees?'\\" Keatley found out that many of them had to have amputations because of complications from diabetes. Diabetes can reduce blood flow to extremities and cause nerve damage, and sometimes amputations are necessary if serious infection sets in and there is severe damage to the tissue and bone. The neighborhood where Keatley lived, East Harlem, has the highest diabetes rate in Manhattan, according to city health officials. It also has the highest obesity rate: One-third of adult residents are obese or overweight. Since then, the 8-year-old and his family have been frequenting their local farmers' market in OPTIONS: - CNN and transforming the way they eat. - CNN Heroes and transforming the way they eat. - East Harlem and transforming the way they eat. - Gina Keatley and transforming the way they eat. - Keatley and transforming the way they eat. - Manhattan and transforming the way they eat. - New York and transforming the way they eat.","completion":"Since then, the 8-year-old and his family have been frequenting their local farmers' market in East Harlem and transforming the way they eat. This lifestyle change has had a tremendous impact on the family. Not only have they been able to support local farmers and sustainable practices, but they have also been able to improve their own health by incorporating more fresh fruits and vegetables into their diets. By visiting the farmers' market, the family is exposed to new and unique produce, giving them an opportunity to try different types of meals and expand their palates. Additionally, by shopping at their local farmers' market, the family is more aware of where their food comes from, which helps them make more informed choices about what they're consuming. This, in turn, reduces the risk of developing health issues such as diabetes and obesity, as the family is now more proactive about maintaining a balanced and nutritious diet. Not only is this transformation important for the family's health, but it also serves as an example for the broader community. As more and more people notice the positive changes and improvements in the family's overall well-being, they may be motivated to adopt similar lifestyles and dietary habits. This can lead to a ripple effect of better health and wellness throughout the entire neighborhood, ultimately helping to address the high rates of diabetes and obesity in East Harlem. Moreover, the shift to healthier eating habits and supporting local farmers could inspire changes at the policy level in the community. For example, city officials might work to improve the availability and accessibility of fresh, healthy foods in the area, such as by opening more farmers' markets, establishing local gardens, or increasing funding for education and initiatives on nutrition and wellness. In turn, this could gradually lower the rates of diabetes and obesity in East Harlem and make it a healthier community for all of its residents. In conclusion, the simple act of the family frequenting their local farmers' market in East Harlem and transforming the way they eat marked the beginning of a potentially larger and deeper change in the community. By choosing to prioritize fresh, local, and nutritious foods, the family not only took control of their own health and well-being but also became beacons of inspiration for others in the neighborhood to do the same. With time and collective effort, it is possible to address and alleviate the health challenges in East Harlem, turning it into a healthier and thriving community for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the most intelligent centaur on and under the Earth, considers himself to be an unappreciated genius, and is the inventor of most of the advanced technology possessed by the fairy world, rivaled only by Opal Koboi. Hypothesis: Foaly considers himself overrated.","completion":"After examining the given context, we can derive the following detailed answer: It would not be accurate or appropriate to draw the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated. We can identify several reasons for this conclusion. Firstly, it is made clear that Foaly is the most intelligent centaur on and under the Earth. This statement indicates that he possesses a unique and superior intellect in comparison to his counterparts in the Artemis Fowl series. His intelligence would likely justify his high opinion of himself, and therefore, he would not consider himself overrated. Secondly, Foaly is described as an unappreciated genius. This sentiment conveys that he feels he doesn't receive the recognition he deserves for his exceptional abilities and inventions. By portraying Foaly as an unappreciated individual, it implies that he believes his skills and contributions are undervalued rather than overrated. Furthermore, Foaly is the inventor of most of the advanced technology possessed by the fairy world, indicating that he has been responsible for significant technological advancements. This contribution would likely bolster his view of himself as an unappreciated genius rather than overrated since his innovations have had a profound impact on the fairy world. Lastly, the presence of a rival, Opal Koboi, suggests that Foaly's self-perception as an unappreciated genius is challenged by competition. The rivalry between Foaly and Opal Koboi most likely pushes Foaly to maintain his status as a leading figure in the technological world. This competitive dynamic would not support the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated, but instead reinforces his belief in his unique abilities. In conclusion, the context provided does not support the hypothesis that Foaly considers himself overrated. Rather, he is portrayed as an intelligent, unappreciated genius with significant contributions to the fairy world's technology. His self-perception as one of the leading inventors and as the most intelligent centaur counters the idea that he thinks he is overrated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here are a few tips for student accommodations that can help ensure a great experience and build lifelong friendships: Screen your roommates carefully if you are given a choice. Combining the living spaces of several students into one location can be exciting and rewarding experience for the outgoing students. If you are on the shy side, or prefer a quiet group to study with, pick quieter roommates. Divide the bills evenly. Some students are far less responsible than their roommates and tend to let their part of the finance slide. Dissatisfaction is quick to build when everyone has to pay the bill for a fellow student who can't seem to pay his/her share of the money. Carry your part of the load. Everyone has to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sometime. Don't avoid your part of responsibility. Student accommodations can get messy and it involves everyone to keep them tidy and healthy. Think about someone else before you think about yourself. Put your roommates interests above your own. Life will be far enjoyable when everyone is concerned about the feelings property and studies of each other. Be open and honest. Hostilities and frustrations may cause problems that can't be fixed. Everyone brings different standards and expectations to group living and it's in everyone's best interest to put them into the open. Disagreements can be managed more warmly when your are willing to be both open and listen to others. Question: The role \\"carry your part of the load\\" means every room member should _ .

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To help skin stay clear of acne, Options are: a). change out or wash a pillow case every couple of days after using it.; b). apply a small coat of olive oil to your cheeks before falling asleep.;","completion":"To help someone accomplish the goal of keeping their skin clear of acne, let's analyze the given options step-by-step and justify the best choice. Option a). Change out or wash a pillowcase every couple of days after using it. Step 1: Determine the importance of a clean pillowcase in preventing acne. Dirty pillowcases can accumulate oil, dirt, and bacteria, which can contribute to acne breakouts. Step 2: Establish a routine to wash or change pillowcases regularly, ideally every couple of days. This will prevent the accumulation of dirt and oils from the face. Step 3: Encourage the use of gentle, hypoallergenic detergent to minimize skin irritation. Option b). Apply a small coat of olive oil to your cheeks before falling asleep. Step 1: Investigate the benefits of olive oil on skin. While olive oil has antioxidant properties and may be hydrating, it can potentially clog pores and may not be suitable for acne-prone skin. Step 2: Weigh the benefits of olive oil against the risks. In this case, the potential to clog pores and exacerbate acne may outweigh any benefits. Justification: Option A, changing or washing a pillowcase every couple of days, is more likely to help the skin stay clear of acne compared to option B. The regular cleaning of a pillowcase will minimize exposure to dirt, oil, and bacteria that can contribute to breakouts, while applying olive oil to the cheeks before sleeping can potentially clog pores and worsen acne.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. Does Chien have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Marisol? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Chien has a higher chance of acid rain than Marisol due to its reliance on coal for electricity generation. Coal is a major source of energy, but its combustion leads to the emission of harmful gases and pollutants in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are two notable pollutants produced when burning coal. When these gases enter the atmosphere, they react with water vapor, oxygen, and other gases to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acidic compounds fall back to the earth's surface as acid rain, causing harm to the environment, water bodies, soil, and living organisms. Marisol, on the other hand, generates electricity using nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants do not release SO2 and NOx as byproducts during the energy production process. Instead, they rely on nuclear reactions to produce heat, which generates steam to power turbines. This method does not contribute to the formation of acid rain because it does not release air pollutants directly into the atmosphere during electricity generation. It is important to note that both cities are using nonrenewable resources as their primary energy source, and these resources will eventually be depleted. However, in terms of acid rain formation, Chien is at a higher risk due to its reliance on coal for electricity generation, which directly contributes to air pollution and the subsequent formation of acid rain. Marisol, depending on nuclear power plants, does not have the same direct impact on acid rain formation, making it less likely to experience acid rain compared to Chien."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Unicorn is transformed into a human woman with a knee length white hair. for the following movie plot: In an enchanted forest, a talking unicorn learns she is the very last of her kind. A butterfly reveals that a demonic animal called the Red Bull herded her kind to the ends of the earth. Venturing into unfamiliar territory beyond the safety of her home, the Unicorn journeys to find them and bring them all back. Upon her journey the Unicorn is captured by the evil witch Mommy Fortuna, and is put on display in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. As most of the attractions are normal animals with a spell of illusion placed on them (to wit, a toothless lion for a Manticore, a crippled chimpanzee for a Satyr, and a mere snake for the \\"Midgard Serpent\\"), Fortuna uses a spell to create another horn on the unicorn's head that the non-magical carnival visitors can see, as they are unable to see her real form. Fortuna keeps the immortal harpy Celaeno captive as well and acknowledges the dangers of caging such a monster, but deems the risk secondary to the deed's recognition and prestige. While held captive, the unicorn is befriended by Schmendrick, an incompetent magician in the service of Mommy Fortuna. With the help of Schmendrick, the Unicorn escapes, in the process freeing Celaeno, who kills Fortuna and her henchman Ruhk. The Unicorn and Schmendrick later gain a second traveling companion Molly Grue, the careworn lover of Captain Cully (the disappointing \\"reality\\" behind the Robin Hood legend). When the Unicorn nears the seaside castle of King Haggard, supposed keeper of the Red Bull, she encounters the animal, which turns out to be a monstrous fire elemental. At the last moment before her capture, Schmendrick uses his unpredictable magic, and transforms her into a human woman with white knee-length hair. In this guise, the Red Bull is uninterested in her and departs. The Unicorn suffers tremendous shock at the feeling of mortality in her body.

Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. High-throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries has become a commonly used method for the identification of drug leads, and non-physiological reducing agents have been widely used for HTS. However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent, reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents: dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-MCE), and tris-(2carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP), in addition to GSH, against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high scoring compounds (~560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many non-overlapping hits. More importantly, we find that various reducing agents alter inhibitor potency (IC 50 ) from ~10 µM with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC 50 > 200 µM) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in a HTS is critical as this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of using GSH for in vitro HTS assays with these three target enzymes.

I called out to him \\"Have you got a light?\\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile. I kept smiling at him, now considering him as a person and not just a jailer. \\"Do you have kids?\\" he asked. \\"Yes, here, here.\\" I took out my wallet and nervously felt the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes were filled with tears. I said that I was scared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too.

Hundreds of people had gathered to watch it in disbelief.\\" This island has become a global curiosity. How was it formed in just a few minutes? As you might already know, many islands in the sea are formed by volcanoes. There are numerous volcanoes under the sea. As the hot lava erupts and cools down, it piles up and forms the shape of a mountain. When the mountain \\"grows\\" to higher than the sea level, the part that's above the water is what we call an \\"island\\". This is how the island was formed after the Pakistan earthquake, except that instead of a regular volcano, it was a \\"mud volcano\\" that brought about this island. Lava is not the only thing that's locked under the Earth's crust -- there is also gas. When an earthquake happens and breaks part of the crust, the gas is released at an extremely high speed, pushing mud up to the surface, according to National Geographic. But only earthquakes that are extremely powerful can cause mud volcanoes to push up enough mud to produce islands -- and this 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Pakistan was strong enough. The island is about 20 meters high, up to about 90 meters wide and 30 meters long, nearly the size of a soccer field. In fact, mud volcano islands aren't new. This is the fourth island of this kind in the region since 1945. But those islands usually didn't last long. \\"It will probably be gone within a couple of months,\\" said Bill Barnhart, a researcher with the US Geological Survey.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the names of the bands who were specifically designated \\"new wave\\"? In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\".

Article:The plight of the double world champion, who some still consider the best driver in the world, was illustrated perfectly over the course of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend - both on track and off. On the circuit, there was evidence of the best and worst of this complex man. Off it, the McLaren driver's future was one of the key topics. Essentially, Alonso has found himself in an awkward catch-22 situation, the core of the issue being whether the 36-year-old will even be in Formula 1 next year. He has lost faith in engine supplier Honda - as the Japanese company's F1 boss admitted to BBC Sport last weekend - but if the team are still using their engines next year, his other options appear limited in the extreme. McLaren are trying to get out of their Honda contract but are finding it difficult to do so. \\"We will see what happens in the next couple of weeks,\\" Alonso said after Sunday's race. \\"I am happy with the team. We are having difficult seasons in the last three years but McLaren is one of the best teams in the world. I would be happy to keep working with them but we need to see how things evolve in the next couple of weeks.\\" Over three days of track action, the Belgian Grand Prix provided a perfect microcosm of the situation in which Alonso and McLaren find themselves. Their other driver, Stoffel Vandoorne, was hit with 55 places of grid penalties over the weekend for using far beyond the permitted number of engine parts this season. The first half of the penalty came when an upgraded engine was fitted before the weekend, the second half when that engine developed a problem on Friday and had to be replaced. Alonso, meanwhile, was surprisingly competitive - in relative terms - at Spa, which is behind only Monza in terms of the influence of engine power on lap time. He was contending for a position in the top-10 qualifying shootout - thanks to help from 'tows' from Vandoorne to minimise the Honda's deficit on the straights - and would have got it had he not suffered a bizarre engine-related issue on his final run in the second knockout session. The Honda failed to deploy its hybrid power boost after the fast Pouhon double left-hander because of a programming error in the electronics. On that lap, Alonso took Pouhon flat out for the first time - something the Ferrari drivers managed but the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers did not, albeit all of them arriving at the corner faster. The problem was the Honda electronics were judging track position - and therefore where to deploy electrical energy - partly by throttle action. As Alonso had not lifted the accelerator, the system did not realise he had taken the corner so did not deploy after it. In the circumstances, his anguished cries of \\"no power, no power\\" were understandable. For the race, Alonso was promoted to 10th on the grid by a five-place penalty for Renault's Jolyon Palmer, and made one of his trademark brilliant starts to be seventh on the first lap. Then the inevitable happened - he started to be picked off on the straight by other cars with much more power than his Honda, which sources say is about 80bhp down on a customer Mercedes engine. This led to a series of grumpy radio messages from Alonso, as he allowed his frustration to show. By lap 24, he was down to 12th, out of the points and with no prospect of scoring any. He asked if any rain was on the horizon to give him hope, was told no, and a lap later reported an engine problem and pulled into the pits to retire. Honda says it has found no evidence of any problems on the data. McLaren are not commenting beyond what they said on Sunday - that Alonso retired because he felt an engine problem. Some believe he 'parked it' - retired a healthy car. This is normally a cardinal sin in F1, where everyone's default position is the driver races as hard as he can until such time as he can no longer, either because the race finishes, he crashes or the car develops a problem. If he did, it may not be the first time this season - some believe he did the same with a couple of laps to go in Bahrain in April, when he was similarly out of the points after a frustrating race. Alonso denied this, and will almost certainly do the same if he is asked about Spa. So people are left to draw their own conclusions. Whether Alonso did or did not 'park it', it has not changed McLaren's desire to keep him in 2018. They continue to refer to persuading Alonso to stay as a \\"priority\\". As such, it seems that whether what happened in Belgium was restricted to a few mardy radio messages, or whether Alonso stopped racing out of sheer frustration and anger, McLaren are regarding it as a reflection of where he is at. If that sounds surprising, it's perhaps because McLaren are in the same place. After three years of terrible performance and awful reliability, the team's leaders are at their wits' end with Honda. Again, they are not commenting directly on the issue publicly, but their attitude to the engine they would like to use next year can best be summed up as ABH - anyone but Honda. This saga started back in March, when the exact scale of the problems Honda had with its new engine first became apparent in pre-season testing. After a redesign over the winter, the new Honda showed dreadful performance and reliability in testing and McLaren began looking around for an alternative. First, they approached Mercedes. Initial signs were encouraging. Sources say there was a gentlemen's agreement between McLaren shareholder Mansour Ojjeh and Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche. But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff was never keen and that deal has now collapsed. Ferrari have also said no, so that leaves Renault. On the face of it, swapping the worst engine in F1 for the second worst, and waving goodbye to a net 100m (£77m) in financial contribution to the team in the process seems an odd decision, but McLaren's bosses believe it makes sense. They are finding it difficult to source sponsorship with their current performance, and Honda's failings are also costing them constructors' points. McLaren are ninth in the standings. But they know from GPS traces that their car's cornering ability is one of the best on the grid and they believe that with a Renault engine they would be able to challenge Red Bull for third overall. Even if they finished fourth, the difference between that and ninth is about £15m. If it was third, that number goes up to £30m. A customer Renault engine would cost in the region of £18m. McLaren produced poor cars when they had Mercedes engines in 2013 and '14 so it is especially frustrating to have sorted out their design department only to find themselves handicapped by their engine. The idea is to get themselves into a reasonably competitive position by 2021, when F1's engine formula will be simplified and a number of other options may be available - perhaps even making their own engine. Media playback is not supported on this device Then there is the cost of losing Alonso. Yes, his 40m (£31m) salary is expensive, but if he left and McLaren were forced to stick with Honda engines, the ramifications are large. First of all, there are few alternatives available. McLaren are interested in Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz as a back-up. But he is not contractually free, Red Bull would want money to release him, and he is no Alonso anyway. There are very few appealing alternatives, and none anywhere near Alonso's ability. Look back over the past three years with Honda and it is clear to see that without Alonso, McLaren would look far worse than they already do. He is the one who has scored their best finishes, who does remarkable things like qualifying seventh in Spain, who routinely makes sensational starts and puts the car in places it has no right to be. When he finished sixth in Hungary, Vandoorne was 10th. This year, his average qualifying position is 12.3; Vandoorne's is 14.8. Last year Alonso's was 11.7; Jenson Button's 12.6. He also provides a level for the car - the team always know where it is competitively, because they know he will always find its limit. There are hardly any other drivers - arguably none - about whom you can say that. Without Alonso, despite all his baggage, things would look even less rosy than they do now. And that's without even thinking about how much harder it would be to attract sponsors. McLaren's problem is that dropping Honda is proving difficult. For a start, Honda do not want to go. And F1's senior figures want Honda to stay in the sport. On top of that, the rules forbid manufacturers supplying more than three teams without special dispensation from the FIA. So if McLaren are going to get Renault engines, they either have to force Honda into a position where it wants to quit - whereby someone else would have to supply them - or cut a deal. McLaren's current plan is for Toro Rosso to take the Hondas, and McLaren to get the Renaults used by Red Bull's junior team. Red Bull and Renault are open to this. Red Bull's strategy is to run the Honda with Toro Rosso, then if Honda gets its act together, switch the supply to Red Bull as well and become their works partner. On the face of it, that's a win-win for Honda - they end a fractured relationship with McLaren, move to a team where the pressure and focus is not anywhere near as great, remove the difficulties created by Alonso's status and personality, and get the chance long-term to move to a team that will offer them at least as much potential as McLaren do. But it seems Honda does not see it that way, and is proving intransigent. And, right now, the most likely scenario appears to be McLaren continuing with Honda. Time is running out. There is a new development Honda engine being introduced for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, which will mean more grid penalties and another frustrating weekend. On past history, it is unlikely to be a major step forward and so is equally unlikely to change Alonso's mind on Honda. But he has few other options. The top three teams are locked up and not interested in him. Williams have talked to him, but they are badly struggling at the moment and that would surely be out of the frying pan into the fire. Renault? There is a seat there alongside Nico Hulkenberg but it would require Alonso to climb down massively on his salary demands and for what? They are nowhere near ready to win either. IndyCar? Alonso's enthusiasm for a full season there is probably well under control, but he would love to win the Indy 500, after his stellar debut there this year. And there is a seat open at the Andretti team, whom he drove for in May. Or what about swallowing his pride and sticking with McLaren, even if they are still with Honda, hope Honda can improve in the second year of this engine design, and do a deal whereby he could at least do the Indy 500 if the car was uncompetitive again? \\"We will consider all the options,\\" he said on Sunday. \\"But we did a fantastic qualifying and a fantastic start. \\"We won a lot of grands prix, a lot of things in our career and we should not be that far back.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The relationship between McLaren and their driver Fernando Alonso is under strain due to the poor reliability and performance of McLaren's Honda-supplied engines. Alonso, a two-time Formula 1 world champion, has lost faith in Honda, and McLaren is reportedly trying to end their current contract with the manufacturer. The team wants to keep Alonso, but finding a viable alternative to Honda has proven difficult, raising questions about the driver's future and the attractiveness of the team to potential sponsors. Alonso's options for alternative teams are also limited, with Renault and the U.S. Indy 500 the most likely potential prospects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years. But those devices have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. \\"After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,\\" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, \\"where everybody would have this available.\\" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices. Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. \\"Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,\\" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. \\"So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of...

Does the word \\"ulteriority\\" mean the same thing in \\"His stories were too susceptible to ulteriority.\\" and \\"A terrible feeling of ulteriority.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"ulteriority\\" has the same fundamental meaning in both instances, but its specific nuances and implications differ according to the context in which it is used. \\"Ulteriority\\" essentially refers to the state or quality of having underlying or hidden intentions, motives, or meanings. The term is derived from the adjective \\"ulterior,\\" which means lying beyond what is openly or directly expressed, something concealed or underlying. In the first sentence, \\"His stories were too susceptible to ulteriority,\\" the use of \\"ulteriority\\" signifies that the stories in question may be prone to having hidden or indirect meanings that may not be easily discernible to the reader or listener. This usage suggests that the author of the stories might have intentionally or inadvertently included underlying messages or motives that are not apparent on the surface. In the second sentence, \\"A terrible feeling of ulteriority,\\" the term \\"ulteriority\\" is used to denote an unexplained sense of suspicion or mistrust. This typically arises from a belief that there might be concealed intentions or motives that have not been made explicit, which could lead to negative consequences or outcomes. This usage highlights a more emotional response to a situation, indicating that the person experiencing this feeling might be uneasy or wary due to a perception that something hidden is at play. While the core meaning of \\"ulteriority\\" remains the same in both instances, the way it is employed within each context shifts how it should be interpreted. In the first sentence, it alludes to the presence of concealed meanings within stories, whereas, in the second sentence, it describes an unsettling feeling arising from the notion that some underlying motives are at work.

It's Not So Simple There was an awkward silence when Terry Rhodes introduced himself to a group of government officials in a West African capital recently. He had called the meeting to discuss the license his company, Celtel International, needed to set up mobile phone service there. Rhodes and his partner, Mo Ibrahim, had founded Celtel in 1998 determined to do business in sub-Saharan Africa by playing it clean. Thanks to persistence and an understanding of local politics, they had already set up phone service in a few neighboring countries without paying a single bribe. Rhodes hoped this meeting would clear the way to securing a license for which they had already paid the statutory fee of 750,000. Instead, the government officials said almost nothing. Only later did Rhodes learn why. One of them had sent a fax that morning to Celtel's Amsterdam headquarters listing the government representatives who would attend the meeting with monetary amounts next to them totaling about 50,000. These were payments just for attendance at the meeting. Further bribes would be needed to close the deal. Because of poor telephone service, Rhodes hadn't learned about the fax when he met the officials. They looked like they were expecting something, but with nothing forthcoming the meeting reached a deadlock. The corruption in that situation is obvious enough. Yet when you look at how business is practiced around the world, it's often not so clear what is corrupt and what is not. We typically identify corruption with side payments, cronyism and nepotism, but all those activities can be entirely legitimate when practiced responsibly in the right cultural context. Corruption is activity that corrupts. It undermines the system in which it occurs. Because business systems can work very differently, different kinds of activity corrupt them. Lee Kam Sheung started the Chinese food products firm Lee Kum Kee as a small oyster sauce business in 1888. By 2005 the family-owned company employed 3,900 workers and was selling its products in 80 countries. Lee's grandson Man Tat was group chairman and had appointed his four sons to serve as chairmen and/or chief executives of various divisions. Man Tat was aware of the importance of bringing managerial expertise into his growing company. He addressed that need partly by sending his sons to business schools in the U.S. before persuading them to join the company. He also set out to recruit non-family professionals as board members and high-level managers. He sought persons who, in his words, were \\"culturally attuned to the firm, and to family as CEOs of its divisions.\\" That is, he wanted professional managers who were comfortable with nepotism. Westerners tend to associate nepotism with lazy and incompetent relatives of bosses. Yet it can have definite advantages in a Confucian culture, where loyalty to the family is paramount. Where a Western grandfather may go easy on his grandson, a Chinese grandfather has authority. He may be able to extract more work from family members than from anyone else. They may not be the most talented possible candidates for a job, but the grandfather knows their strengths and weaknesses intimately and can assign them duties that take advantage of their particular skills. Nepotism becomes corruption when elders don't exercise enough care in placing their relatives. Responsible nepotism, however, can be perfectly legitimate for a company in the right cultural setting, as Lee Kum Kee illustrates. The same goes for cronyism. A purchasing agent in Taiwan may award a contract to an old friend rather than the lowest bidder because the friend can be trusted to deliver a good product. That kind of responsible cronyism (known as guanxi) has been a foundation of business in Taiwan for centuries. It becomes corrupt only when the agent favors friends simply because they are friends, rather than because they can be trusted to do the job right. Many such cultural differences arise from the fact that Western cultures are built on rules and transparency, while most of the world's other cultures are relationship-based. Westerners trust rule-based institutions; others trust their friends and family far more and are therefore especially keen to cultivate strong relationships. Gifts to officials can play an important role in relationship building. For example, Korean businessmen granted a meeting with an important official may bring an envelope full of cash as a token of gratitude. They may send the official a generous gift in observance of a wedding, or in condolence after a death in the family. Within limits, these gifts merely signal a commitment to the relationship. Personal connections of this kind have historically helped to align the powerful chaebol--family-owned firms--with government policies, and thus they have been a key to Korea's economic success. Culturally appropriate gift-giving can, of course, easily slip into quid-pro-quo bribery, as frequently happens in Korea. Side payments are a constant temptation in a relationship-based system, because they are a shortcut past the slow and laborious process of building relationships based on trust. The West has its own temptations. With our increasing reliance on rules and transparency, the power of relationships and personal authority in our culture has weakened over the years. With legal supervision relatively light, the system relies largely on voluntary compliance with ethical and legal norms. This makes for an efficient economy, but there is constant temptation to cheat or take shortcuts. That is corruption, no less than is bribery. Its effects are amply illustrated by the recent crisis in the Western financial system, when a few irresponsible players precipitated a global credit freeze. Even bribery in West Africa can be seen as a responsible practice gone awry. In a traditional village context, African leaders earned respect by judiciously bestowing gifts and favors on their subjects. That wasn't simply a patronage system; it was also a form of rational redistribution. The chief channeled wealth where it was most needed, increasing the community's survival advantage. With the coming of colonialism and Western-style institutions, men frequently left villages to take government jobs in the capital. They continued to use gifts to obtain influence, but they left behind the social context that had structured and guided the practice. Responsible generosity became irresponsible influence peddling. Business executives operating in Africa today should try to earn the influence they need through responsible generosity. They might build infrastructure or schools instead of paying off officials or political parties. There--and in general--the key to avoiding corruption is to understand what makes the local business culture work, and to stick to practices that reinforce the system, not ones that tear it apart. John Hooker is a professor at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, see his \\"Corruption from a Cross-cultural Perspective,\\" in Vol. 16, Issue 3 of Cross-Cultural Management: An International Journal (2009). The Celtel experience is further described in the 2008 London Business School case study \\"Terry Rhodes,\\" by A. Karim, T. Putimahtama, and J. Mullins.

What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the complex nature of corruption and how cultural differences can make certain practices seem corrupt when they may not be in a specific context. It explains that activities like nepotism, cronyism, and gift-giving can sometimes be legitimate and even beneficial in certain cultural settings, but they can also lead to corruption when practiced irresponsibly or taken to extremes.

His second plan is to attend a journalism graduate school at Columbia University when his holidays end. A few days after his graduation, his parents (Wendie Malick and Jack Gilpin) advise him to seek a part-time job rather than going to Europe when they unexpectedly announce that financial problems have taken a toll on them and they would be unable to financially support him.

While both questions focus on a negative event involving the individual, the context and the actions being referred to are different. 1. What is the worst thing someone has pressured you to do? This question is asking about a situation in which the individual was pressured, influenced, or coerced by someone else to engage in an activity or decision against their will or better judgment. It focuses on the negative consequences that may have resulted from succumbing to that pressure, and the person's feelings or experiences as they navigated that situation. This question acknowledges the external force and implies a certain level of manipulation, persuasion, or control by the other person. The emphasis is on the act of being pressured by someone else and the resulting action that the individual took. 2. What is the worst thing that someone did to you? This question is more concerned with the action another person has taken directly against the individual. It addresses any harm, wrongdoing, or malicious behavior that someone has inflicted on the person. This question encompasses a wide range of negative experiences, which might include physical harm, emotional harm, or even indirect damage such as defaming someone's character.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While the two questions might seem related, they are not the same and address different aspects of the genetics and reasoning behind blue eyes in wolves. 1. Can wolves have blue eyes? Yes, wolves can have blue eyes. Blue-eyed wolves are rare but possible due to the variation in eye color among these animals. Eye color in wolves is determined by various genetic factors and typically ranges from yellow to amber, with some rare cases of blue eyes. Studies have found that multiple genes, rather than a single gene mutation, might affect the eye color in wolves. Blue-eyed wolves are most frequently seen in Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes and occur less frequently in other breeds. In newborn wolf pups, blue eyes are a common phenomenon. The reason behind this is that the melanin, responsible for the eye color, is not fully developed at birth, leading to the bluish tint. As the wolf pups grow older, the melanin production increases, and their eyes generally turn into a more common color found in adult wolves, such as amber or yellow. Blue eyes in adult wolves are relatively rare occurrences and can be attributed to specific genetic combinations. 2. Why do wolves have blue eyes? The reason wolves have blue eyes is due to variations in their genetic makeup. Eye color in wolves is influenced by the specific combination of genes that they inherit from their parents. Wolves can possess both dominant and recessive genes, which determine several traits, including eye color. The possession of a unique combination of genes can result in a wolf having blue eyes. In the case of blue eyes, it is believed to be a result of the complex interplay of multiple genes that regulate melanin's distribution in the iris, which could lead to less melanin in the front layer of the iris. The phenomenon is marked by a particular scattering of light in the stroma, which is the fibrous, connective tissue of the iris, contributing to the blue color. Because blue eyes are determined by a specific interaction of multiple genes, wolves that have this trait are less common compared to those with the more prevalent eye colors. In summary, the first question, \\"Can wolves have blue eyes?\\", is aimed at establishing whether wolves can possess blue eyes or not. Meanwhile, the second question, \\"Why do wolves have blue eyes?\\", explores the process and genetic factors behind the blue eye color in those wolves that do have it. These two questions address different aspects of the blue-eyed phenomenon in wolves, and thus, while related, they are not the same."},{"prompt":"Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: My main comment is, if you want to be reading about tracing wood grains, you'll enjoy this book.

Is this product review negative?","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The main reason this review is considered negative is due to the various issues and dissatisfaction experienced by the customer. Below is the explanation as to why this review has a negative tone and points out several issues with the product and company: 1. Wrong product received: The customer states that they received a different product than the one they ordered. Receiving the wrong product is a significant inconvenience for the customer, as it implies one or more issues with the fulfilment and shipping process. In this case, the customer received a foosball tabletop game, which was not their original choice. 2. Lesser value product: The review also highlights that the received product had a lower price compared to the one initially ordered. This further adds to the frustration, as not only was the wrong product sent, but the customer also paid a higher price and did not receive the corresponding value. 3. Inability to return the item: The timing of their realization of the mistake made it impossible for the customer to return the item due to the impending Christmas season. As a result, the customer was unable to correct this unfortunate situation. 4. Lack of recommendation: The negative experience has made the customer not want to recommend the company to others. This shows the customer's loss of faith in the company's ability to deliver the right product promptly and accurately. Consequently, it contributes to the negative tone of the review. In summary, the product review is negative primarily because the customer received the wrong item, was charged the higher price, could not send back the product in time due to the holiday season, and ultimately does not recommend ordering from the company. These factors combined portray a disappointed and dissatisfied customer, characterizing the overall review as negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Q: Multiple sclerosis, huntington’s disease, parkinson’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease are example of diseases of which body system? Choices: - muscular system - lymphatic system - circulatory system - nervous system A: The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Nervous System. Multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease are all examples of diseases that affect the nervous system. The nervous system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body and is made up of two primary components: the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body. Here is a brief overview of each of these diseases: 1. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system attacks the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin. This causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body, eventually leading to nerve damage. 2. Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. The disease affects motor control, cognitive abilities, and psychiatric symptoms. As the disease progresses, it leads to a gradual decline in physical and mental abilities. 3. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the brain's motor system. The disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and balance problems. 4. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, which is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting memory, thinking, and behavior.

Fernando Alonso, the double world champion who recently left Ferrari, will rejoin McLaren for the 2015 season, which gets underway in March. The Spaniard, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, joins the British team after ending his four-year association with Ferrari. He will be partnered by Jenson Button, whose services were retained above Kevin Magnussen, who stays on as a test and reserve driver. Between them, Alonso and Button have won three world titles, 47 grands prix and achieved 147 podium finishes from a combined 500 races. \\"We signed Fernando a little ago, but we decided not to announce the fact until we had also re-signed OPTIONS: - Alonso as his teammate. - British as his teammate. - Button as his teammate. - CNN as his teammate. - F1 as his teammate. - Fernando Alonso as his teammate. - Ferrari as his teammate. - Formula One as his teammate. - Jenson Button as his teammate. - Kevin Magnussen as his teammate. - Magnussen as his teammate. - McLaren as his teammate. - Renault as his teammate. - Ron Dennis as his teammate. - Spaniard as his teammate.","completion":"In late 2014, the Formula One community was abuzz with rumors and speculation surrounding the future of Fernando Alonso, the accomplished double world champion who had recently parted ways with Ferrari. It was all but certain that Alonso would re-sign with McLaren for the 2015 season, but the announcement was not made official until several months later. The news came as a welcome relief to fans who had eagerly been anticipating the confirmation. Fernando Alonso, a Spanish driver who secured back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, ended his four-year stint with the prestigious Ferrari team before rejoining McLaren for the season that was scheduled to begin in March 2015. The confirmation of his decision to partner with Jenson Button, an experienced British driver who has won numerous titles and accolades over the course of his career. Between Alonso and Button, they have amassed three world titles, 47 Grand Prix wins, and 147 podium finishes from a combined total of 500 races. The decision to hold off on announcing Alonso's signing with McLaren until they had managed to secure Button as his teammate was a strategic one on behalf of the team. This allowed them to maintain an air of mystery and intrigue around their lineup until they were confident in sharing the news. Jenson Button, a highly accomplished driver in his own right, was ultimately chosen to partner with Alonso for the 2015 season, beating out the talented Danish driver Kevin Magnussen. Magnussen, who enjoyed a successful career with McLaren before this decision was made, was retained as a test and reserve driver for the team. The combination of the formidable talents of Alonso and Button made for an exciting partnership and a promising future for McLaren. Alonso's return to McLaren marked a new chapter in an already storied career. His previous success with Renault, which included titles in 2005 and 2006, had solidified his status as one of the top drivers in the Formula One world. His move to Ferrari, one of the most iconic and successful teams in the sport, garnered him even more recognition and respect. However, it seemed that the union between Alonso and Ferrari was not destined to endure, and the split led to his eventual return to McLaren. The 2015 season offered plenty of opportunities for this dynamic duo to prove their worth on the track. With experienced team leaders and skilled engineers at the helm, the McLaren-Button-Alonso combination held great potential for success. As the team embarked on what was sure to be an exciting season, fans eagerly awaited the chance to see these two accomplished drivers work together, with the aim of achieving further glory and adding to McLaren's storied history in the world of Formula One racing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Molly has just moved to a new city for a job she was just hired for. She used to live in a city up in the mountains named Midgar. She liked living there due to the hikes she could go on and seeing the beautiful nature of the hills and mountains. The town she lives in now, Treno, is closer to sea level and is mostly flat plains and farm land. It's a change of scenery, and she hopes she starts to enjoy it more. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city has an atmosphere with less depth? Hint: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. A:","completion":"Midgar B: Treno To determine which city has an atmosphere with less depth, we need to consider the information provided in the hint. It mentions that air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and more slowly at higher altitudes. Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest, and it is less at higher altitudes, where the depth is less.

Does \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture.\\" correctly answer the question of Sinhalese buddhist reformer portrayed what Canon as the original version of scripture?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture\\" accurately answers the question of what Canon was portrayed by Sinhalese Buddhist reformers as the original version of scripture. To provide more context and information, let us delve deeper into the background of the Sinhalese Buddhist reform movement and the significance of the Pali Canon. Sinhalese Buddhism refers to the Theravada Buddhist tradition practiced in Sri Lanka, which has a rich historical and cultural legacy. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Sri Lanka experienced a revival of Buddhism, spurred by a combination of factors including the impact of British colonial rule, the emergence of a national consciousness, and the need to reassert the religious and cultural heritage of the island. In this period, several Sinhalese Buddhist reformers emerged, including Anagarika Dharmapala, Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera, Waskaduwe Subhūti Maha Thera, and Walane Siri Siddhartha Maha Thera. These reformers played pivotal roles in the Buddhist revival movement by emphasizing the importance of study, practice, and dissemination of Buddhist teachings in their original form. The Pali Canon, also known as the Tipitaka or Three Baskets, is considered the most ancient and comprehensive collection of Theravada Buddhist teachings. The Canon consists of three divisions: the Vinaya Pitaka (rules and discipline for monastics), the Sutta Pitaka (sermons and discourses), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (philosophical and psychological analysis). The teachings contained in the Pali Canon are believed to have been recorded in Pali, the lingua franca of the ancient Indian subcontinent during the time of the Buddha. This collection of texts serves as the foundation for modern Theravada Buddhism. Sinhalese Buddhist reformers stressed the importance of the Pali Canon, which they believed represents the true and original form of the Buddha's teachings. By portraying the Pali Canon as the authentic and authoritative source of Buddhist scripture, the reformers established a clear link between Sinhalese Buddhism and the earliest teachings of the historical Buddha. This emphasis on the primacy of the Pali Canon also served to differentiate Theravada Buddhism from other forms of Buddhism, such as Mahayana and Vajrayana, which employ additional texts and interpretations of the teachings. In conclusion, the statement that \\"Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture\\" accurately answers the question about the Canon that these reformers focused on. These reformers aimed to preserve the purity and authenticity of Buddhist teachings by promoting the study and practice of the Pali Canon as the definitive source of the Buddha's teachings. This focus on the Pali Canon played a crucial role in the revival and establishment of the unique identity of Sinhalese Buddhism in Sri Lanka during this period."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: Blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins.

The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window.

Question: Process: - A bird hatches from an egg - The bird is nurtured by its parents - And is fed food for growth - The bird grows - Begins to learn how to fly - The bird matures - The bird leaves its nest - The bird makes its own nest. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose baby bird stays with parents happens, how will it affect MORE birds. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a baby bird stays with its parents, it will affect the overall population dynamics and behavior of birds. The suggested perturbation underlies the premise that the baby bird does not follow the conventional process of growth and independence. It is important to understand the implications of this perturbation at various levels, such as individual birds, family units, species, and ecosystems. Direct effects of baby birds staying with their parents: 1. Competition for resources: If the offspring continues to stay with its parents, they might end up competing for the same resources, such as food, nesting sites, and mates. This increased competition may lead to higher stress levels in the birds and decrease the overall availability of resources for all birds in the area. 2. Maturity delays: The baby bird's prolonged stay with its parents could result in slowed development or delayed maturity. A delay in maturity could impact the bird's ability to reproduce and maintain population levels within its species. Indirect effects of baby birds staying with their parents: 1. Social structure: If, in general, baby birds stay with their parents for longer periods, it will alter the social structure of the bird species. An increased number of family units with multiple generations living together would change the way they communicate, defend territories, and forage for food. 2. Population dynamics: The prolonged stay of offspring may cause the reproduction rate of the bird species to decrease due to delayed maturity and reduced availability of resources. The altered population dynamics could lead to fluctuations in their population size, including a potential reduction of population growth. 3. Interspecies interactions: With less room for new nests, the affected species may encroach upon the territories of other species or find it challenging to create their own. This could lead to an increase in interspecies competition and disruptions in the ecological balance among the bird communities, affecting the overall ecosystem. 4. Evolutionary implications: If the trend of staying with parents becomes widespread among a particular species, it may create a selection pressure over time. Birds that are more inclined to remain with their parents could be less fit for survival or reproduction, potentially driving an evolutionary change in their social behaviors. 5. Impact on ecosystems: Changes in bird populations and behaviors could have cascading consequences on the ecosystem. Birds play a vital role as pollinators, seed dispersers, and predators of insects. Therefore, any shift in their populations could impact the functioning of the entire ecosystem. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of baby birds staying with their parents has both direct and indirect effects on the process of bird growth and maturation and can impact individual birds, family units, species, and ecosystems. A sustained trend of staying with parents could lead to notable changes in the dynamics of bird populations and have far-reaching implications on overall ecosystem health and species interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized, the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"There is only 2 religions to choose from, Islam and jahilliyya\\" correctly answer the question \\"How do Bin Laden and Qutb rationalize the mass murder and hate of Americans and nonbelievers?\\"? OPT: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"(2). yes The response \\"There is only 2 religions to choose from, Islam and jahilliyya\\" does correctly answer the question \\"How do Bin Laden and Qutb rationalize the mass murder and hate of Americans and nonbelievers?\\" based on the information provided in the paragraph. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that Sayyid Qutb, an influential thinker for Osama Bin Laden, described the world as being divided into two conditions: Islam and jahiliyya (ignorance and unbelief). According to Qutb's view, which Bin Laden shares, humans can only choose between these two conditions, and there is no middle ground. Qutb also believed that many people, including Muslims, were being drawn to jahiliyya because of its material comforts, and as a result, they were seen as a threat to the pure version of Islam that Qutb and Bin Laden advocate. It is within this context that they both rationalize mass murder and hatred toward nonbelievers, including Americans, as a necessary defense of their interpretation of the Islamic faith. In their perspective, Muslims who do not accept their views are considered nonbelievers and are also worthy of destruction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. But I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] What is an answer for this question: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?","completion":"In order to answer the question \\"Which fruit retained their quality longer, peaches or cherries?\\" we will take the following steps: 1. Analyze the data provided: Mary candied her peaches, while Ann ate her cherries fresh. 2. Review the information about the preservation method: According to the background information given, the process of candying fruit allows it to retain its quality for a year due to the saturation of sugar preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Given the information provided, we can deduce that: Since Mary candied her peaches, they would have retained their quality for up to a year.

In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Frenzal Rhomb's Whalley and McDougall worked as Jay and the Doctor on Triple J's breakfast show from January 2005 through to November 2007. Prior to their employment at Triple J, the group's music had been banned after they had earlier criticised the station on air for playing the \\"same 40 songs\\". In 2004, they were asked to perform occasional late night shifts and request segments, which developed into the breakfast show slot. Their format includes banter where they provide \\"quips, one-liners, slagging off each other, other bands, other breakfast announcers, listeners, Triple J, Australian Idol and St Ives. It's verbal ping pong but more discursive.\\" The band released Forever Malcolm Young in October 2006 - the title is a conflated reference to the 2005 song \\"Forever Young\\" by Youth Group and the name of AC/DC's guitarist, Malcolm Young - which peaked in the top 40. It provided a minor radio hit with the title track. Some controversy was expressed over the profanity in the title and lyrics of \\"Johnny Ramone was in a Fucking Good Band, but He Was a Cunt\\" (see Johnny Ramone, Ramones). Whalley's attitude to profanity and obscenity is \\"I often get amazed how offended people get by language, especially in Australia when its nothing you wouldn't hear in your local office or schoolyard. But we do make a point of shaking things up\\". Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll described them \\"[their] history is littered with legendary stories, perhaps true, perhaps exaggerations, but stories which fuel and match their song and album titles. Their songs are often profane, likely to poke fun at someone including themselves, hint at a social conscience, and inside all the tough talk and body jokes be hopelessly romantic.\\" National touring followed the album's release, along with the announcement that from November 2007 Whalley would be leaving both Frenzal Rhomb and his job at Triple J to go on a world trip with his girlfriend. Some later copies of Forever Malcolm Young contained a bonus DVD covering the band's tours from 2002 up until 2005. It is titled Sucking All Over the World.

OPTIONS: [i] no. [ii] yes.","completion":"[i] no. The questions you asked have different meanings. I will explain them to you one by one. 1. Why does yellow mustard relieve a burn? Yellow mustard can sometimes help with a burn because it has ingredients like vinegar and cold temperature that can cool down and soothe the burn area. Just like when you get hurt, and putting a cold pack on it makes it feel better. But remember, mustard is not a real medicine for burns, so it's always better to use a proper burn treatment given by a doctor or grown-up. 2.

Today's story is about a lady named Dana Holmes and how she is taking a stand against some police officers who didn't follow the rules. Dana believes they did a search on her that was not needed and against the law. Let's find out more! One day, Dana Holmes was arrested because she was driving her car after drinking alcohol, which is known as a DUI arrest. When the police officers caught her, they took her to a place called a jail, where people who break the rules stay for some time. However, the story doesn't end there! Dana says that the four officers in the jail did something very wrong. They searched her in a way that she thought was not needed and against the law. In fact, Dana feels so strongly about this that she has decided to sue, or take legal action, against these officers and the police station. To help her with this problem, Dana has a lawyer, which is a person who knows the law very well and can help others when they have problems with it. The lawyer wants to make sure this doesn't happen to more women. He has found out that other women may have been searched in an illegal way too! Because of this, the lawyer is trying to protect everyone by asking the jail to keep all the video recordings taken inside the building. These recordings can show what the police officers and people in the jail are doing. If they have done something wrong, the videos can help to prove it. In conclusion, Dana Holmes is standing up for her rights and other women who may have been treated unfairly.

Here is an article: LOS ANGELES — One of the highlights of the Los Angeles Auto Show is the presentation of the Green Car of the Year Award. The 2008 winner is scheduled to be announced Nov. 16 during press previews at the 2007 show. After looking over the field of candidates for this yearâs award, Iâm shifting my rating of the event from highlight to lowlight. While I applaud those, such as the Green Car Journal that gives out this award, who care about sustainable mobility, and who seek to encourage and inspire environmental responsibility with an award like this, I can only hope that next year they have more to work with. How boring are this year’s five finalists? Letâs just say if the five were contestants in a reality television show, the audience would probably try to vote all five off the show in the first episode. Four of the five finalists feature warmed-over technology that had been previously introduced or licensed from others. The fifth, the likely frontrunner, is a full-size S.U.V. that weighs almost three tons and is only affordable if you make a six-figure income. Saturn Aura Hybrid — This Green Line Hybrid was introduced at the Los Angeles show a year ago and is now on sale, although Saturn says availability is limited. The Green Line system shuts the four-cylinder gas engine off at stoplights, resulting in a savings of a couple of miles per gallon in city driving. This model costs 2,300 more than the base, gas-only 20,395 Aura XE. Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid — This vehicle features the same mild-hybrid system that General Motors introduced in the Green Line, but this model has a base price about 14 percent — 2,795 — more than a base 19,995 Malibu LS. The marketing pitch here is that the Malibu and Aura hybrids cost fractionally less than a Toyota Prius, but only because the timing of G.M.âs release of these two vehicles more or less coincided with the expiration of federal hybrid tax credits for the Prius. But the Prius is still far more economical than any of G.M.âs mild hybrids. Mazda Tribute Hybrid — Have you seen the Ford Escape Hybrid? Then youâve seen what powers this vehicle. The Mazda Tribute, which is just a re-badged Escape, is another way that Ford is trying to help amortize the development costs of its hybrid system (and the costs of Toyotaâs help in making the software to run it work). I like the Escape Hybrid, but the technology, having been introduced years ago, is now old news. Nissan Altima Hybrid — This is a very nice vehicle that Nissan seems to have thrown in a closet, with a “do not resuscitate” tag on it. It is only sold in a few states, where Nissan has determined the highest word-of-mouth interest in hybrids is. It is supported by little or nothing in the way of marketing or advertising campaigns. Nissan licensed the hybrid technology from Toyota because it didnât have the expertise or money to develop a serious hybrid of its own — at least not quickly enough. If the Altima wins, Nissan should send the trophy to Toyota — or bury it in the backyard. Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid — Hereâs your frontrunner; it is most likely to win, but should it? General Motors tells me I am missing the boat if I am not wowed by the hybrid technology in this vehicle. Well, it is pretty impressive. It was developed in conjunction with BMW and the old DaimlerChrysler. In fact, Chrysler is unveiling two hybrid vehicles, an Aspen S.U.V. and a Durango S.U.V., with the same technology, at this yearâs L.A. show. But I have two issues: The Two-Mode transmission system at work here is expensive and significantly drives up the cost of an already pricey vehicle. And G.M. insists, so far at least, on putting it only in the vehicles where it will do G.M. (and its Corporate Average Fuel Economy numbers) the most good. I suppose G.M. would argue that the world would be a better place if the public all bought massive S.U.V.’s from General Motors. But I donât think people interested in hybrids would buy that argument, or this vehicle. I think those buyers want truly economical, small-footprint vehicles that get 50-70 miles a gallon. (And, so far, they arenât getting them.) The Two-Mode hybrid system boosts the Tahoeâs city mileage to more than 20 m.p.g. If the technology is so good, why not just put it on all S.U.V.’s from General Motors? Or all G.M. vehicles for that matter? That would shake things up. That, of course, isn’t likely to happen. So that leaves me wondering where are the green cars worthy of a tree-hugger’s love, not to mention this award? Where are the game-changing sustainable mobility models, the visionary designs that will excite buyers and truly make a difference in our world? Still orbiting out there, I suppose, somewhere in Tomorrowland. Update, 7:19 p.m. — In comments, some readers have asked about mileage figures. Here they are: 2008 Chevrolet Malibu LS 4 - 22 city, 30 highway; the hybrid version - 24/32 2008 Saturn Aura XE 4 - 22/30; hybrid - 24/32 2008 Chevy Tahoe LS 2WD - 15/20 (4WD 14/19); hybrid 2WD - 21/22 (4WD 20/20) 2007 Nissan Altima CVT - 23/29; hybrid - 42/36 2008 Mazda Tribute - 19/24; hybrid - 34/30 Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Green Car of the Year Award Finals Disappoint with Outdated and Expensive Hybrid Technologies\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The wearing of colorful, boldly-printed pajamas in public has been popular in the city for years, and well-documented on Flickr as well as National Geographic.

This casual fashion choice has been popular in Shanghai for years, with people sporting colorful and boldly-printed pajamas while going about their daily routines. The trend has even caught the attention of photographers and been featured in National Geographic. However, the city's upcoming hosting of the 2010 World Expo has prompted officials to launch an attack on this unconventional style choice, citing concerns with public etiquette. The South China Morning Post has reported that authorities in the Qiba neighborhood have been enlisting officials and volunteers since July in an effort to dissuade people from wearing their sleepwear outside the home. According to Chinese sociologist Zhang Jiehai, the custom of wearing pajamas in public first started as a practical solution to the city's cramped living conditions, which resulted in a blurred distinction between public and private spaces. While some residents may be unhappy with this crackdown on their personal fashion preferences, the effort to clean up the city's image in time for the World Expo highlights the importance of maintaining a certain standard of appearance in public settings. In the meantime, those who are attached to their comfortable and colorful sleepwear might have to resort to hosting private pajama parties instead."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Resigned: Sir Norman Bettison will step down next year. The head of West Yorkshire Police will stand down after being accused of smearing fans in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy. Sir Norman Bettison said the move will allow independent officials to fully investigate the devastating allegations about his integrity. The chief constable said the recent uproar made him 'reflect' on 'what is best for the future of policing' in his force area. Two weeks ago he was accused of being involved in a South Yorkshire Police 'black propaganda' campaign set up to smear fans in the days after Hillsborough. The top officer was also forced to issue a humiliating apology after saying Liverpool fans were partly to blame for what happened. He faced calls to resign from the families of victims for criticising fans' behaviour despite an independent panel clearing them of wrongdoing. Sir Norman, 56, said he will retire from his £225,000 post on March 31 next year, despite being recently granted an extension to his contract. It remains to be seen whether he will receive any extra pay off over his gold-plated public sector pension of up to £150,000 a year. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of Hillsborough. The damning report on the Hillsborough disaster laid bare a shocking cover-up which attempted to shift the blame on to its 96 victims. The inquiry found that 164 police statements were altered, 116 of them to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster. The. watchdog said it is conducting a 'detailed assessment' of a referral. from West Yorkshire Police Authority. It is also examining his comments. last month. Supporters of Sir Norman said he has been the victim of a 'witch-hunt' in the wake of the release of the explosive Hillsborough report. In a statement released last night, he said: 'Recent weeks have caused me to reflect on what is best for the future of policing in West Yorkshire and I have now decided to set a firm date for my retirement of March 31, 2013. Tragic: Liverpool fans tried to get away from the crush in the stadium. Trevor Hicks, who lost his daughters Vicki, 15, and Sarah, 19, in the tragedy wants the chief constable stripped of his knighthood. 'Furthermore, I hope it will enable. the Independent Police Complaints Commission to fully investigate. allegations that have been raised about my integrity. 'They need to be fairly and fully investigated and I welcome this independent and formal scrutiny.' Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the. Hillsborough Families Support Group, said: 'Obviously I’m very, very. pleased. I’m absolutely delighted that he’s going. 'But then he’ll be going on his full. pension, and I’d like to know the full reasons why he’s choosing to. retire as soon as this.' Mrs Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son. James died in the tragedy, said: 'Why didn’t he stay, then, until the. IPCC came out with their investigation? 'But he’s decided to leave. I’m not arguing against it, because I’m thrilled that he is going.' Sir Norman, who began his policing career in South Yorkshire, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the disaster. Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son. Kevin died on the Leppings Lane terrace, said the findings of the recent. report left Sir Norman with no choice but to retire. She said: 'I think the whole lot of. them who have been involved for these 23 years should all go for the. hurt that they have caused us for 23 years. 'I don’t think he would have retired if it wasn’t for the Hillsborough report.' Trevor Hicks, who lost his two. daughters, 19-year-old Sarah and 15-year-old Victoria, told ITV News:. 'I’m glad he’s realised his position. is untenable, however I’m determined that he does not escape his just. desserts and I will make sure he’s stripped of his knighthood. 'He should leave with nothing, like he tried to leave the families.' Questions about Sir Norman’s role in. the investigation of the tragedy have dogged him as he has risen through. the higher ranks of the police - most notably when there were protests. from the families of those who died when he became Chief Constable of. Merseyside in 1998. Undeterred. by this opposition, Sir Norman stayed on in Liverpool for six years and. was even named an honorary fellow of the city’s John Moores University. Liverpool fans held up a Hillsborough banner before the match between Liverpool and Manchester United after the explosive report. Support: Liverpool fans hold up a mosiac spelling out 'justice' and 'the truth' after report findings. After retiring from the police in 2004 to become the chief executive of Centrex, a firm which offered training to police forces, he was knighted for services to policing in 2006. Returning to an active role in the police and Yorkshire, Sir Norman became West Yorkshire Police’s chief constable in January 2007 and was designated the officer responsible for overseeing policing of domestic extremism. Last month he was singled out as the. most senior serving policeman allegedly involved in a 'black propaganda' campaign that followed the 1989 stadium disaster. He was part of a South Yorkshire. Police unit which tried to ensure the force was exonerated over the. tragedy and fans were put in the spotlight. The report revealed that as a chief. inspector he produced a video for MPs which highlighted how a pitch. invasion was 'thought' to have happened. It added that policing a match was 'reliant on some co-operation' from fans. Liverpool MP Maria Eagle said the unit he was part of was nothing more than a 'black propaganda' campaign. But Sir Norman insisted he had 'nothing to hide' as a clamour for him to resign intensified but sparked fresh fury by placing some blame on fans. He stressed he had played no role in changing officers' accounts of what happened, saying: 'I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered.' He pointed out that he had been off-duty and attended the fateful FA Cup semi-final match as a fan, immediately joining the police effort. In 1998, several police authority members quit when Sir Norman was made chief of Merseyside over his role in preparing the police response to Hillsborough. In April 2010, Sir Norman raised eyebrows by saying that he was not worth his bumper pay and pension package. He said huge pay awards were 'untenable' and many employed by the state were following a vocation and would happily do the job for less pay. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'. All I say is ‘Good’ and move on to the next customer. Hitler-lite phones my corporation to voice a complaint, so a suit comes out and asks the team who did it, I fess up so I can save the time and not have a reason to hate one of my co-workers.

A barista D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given in the situation, the correct answer is likely C. A barista. It is stated that she works in a chain cafe, and she talks about a customer complaining that her coffee took too long. This suggests that her role involves making and serving coffee, which is generally the purview of a barista. In addition, she mentions dealing with a steady stream of customers and her job requiring her to maintain a professional demeanor despite stress, tasks that are typically associated with being a barista. Consequently, her role is unlikely to be that of a cook, as this scenario is more concerned with customer interaction than food preparation. Fast food workers also deal with customers, but the specifics of the situation indicate a setting more specific to a coffee shop or cafe. Lastly, although we can never have 100% certainty in such classifications without more explicit information, the given context strongly supports the conclusion that she is a barista."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Ongoing Saga Between Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson: Recent Threats and New Relationships Introduction: There is never a dull moment in the saga between British art collector Charles Saatchi and his ex-wife, the TV chef and food writer Nigella Lawson. Their tumultuous relationship, which ended on bitter terms, seemed to be relatively left alone by the media in recent months as both parties moved on with their lives. However, recent sources have come to light revealing that this former Hollywood couple is still in the spotlight, and their story has continued on a different path. Charles Saatchi Threatens to Sue Nigella Lawson: Sources close to the couple have revealed that Saatchi is threatening legal action against Lawson for a staggering £500,000 sum. The reasons behind this threat remain undisclosed, but it appears that tensions continue to run high between the estranged pair. This development comes as a shock to many, especially considering the circumstances behind the couple's highly-publicized split. In June 2013, photographs emerged of Saatchi with his hands around Nigella Lawson's neck during an argument at an outdoor dining area in London. The images created a media firestorm, and the couple soon separated. Saatchi later described the incident as a \\"playful tiff,\\" emphasizing that it was not violent in nature. However, Lawson was granted a swift divorce on the grounds of Saatchi's unreasonable behavior. Since that time, the art collector has received public backlash for his actions, and some speculate that the threatened lawsuit might be a means of feeling vindicated or regaining control. Trinny Woodall: Charles Saatchi's New Love Interest In another twist to the story, Charles Saatchi has also been spotted multiple times with fashion expert Trinny Woodall. Woodall, best known for her work on the television series \\"What Not to Wear,\\" seems to be romantically involved with Saatchi, and the pair has attended numerous events together. These public outings have left many wondering about the nature of their relationship. While both Saatchi and Woodall have not publicly commented on their personal lives, they have been seen enjoying each other's company frequently, leading many to believe that a romance is blossoming. The newly found companionship could potentially help Saatchi restore his public image, showing that he has moved past the painful events surrounding his previous marriage. Conclusion: While the whirlwind relationship between Charles Saatchi and Nigella Lawson may have ended, the repercussions are still being felt. With Saatchi's most recent threat of a lawsuit against his former spouse and his emerging relationship with Trinny Woodall, it appears that the story between these two public figures and their tumultuous past is far from over. It remains to be seen whether Saatchi's threatened lawsuit will come to fruition or whether the new relationship will outlast the public's ever-watchful eye. Although both parties have tried to move on after their explosive split, the scars of their past are still raw and visible, reminding us that even prestigious figures cannot elude the darker aspects of human nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement. A retroactive label, the musicians involved were not originally associated with each other, coming from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes. - Cock Sparrer is a punk rock band formed in 1972 (but didn't release an album until 78) in the East End of London, England. Although they have never enjoyed commercial success, they are considered one of the most influential street punk bands of all time, helping pave the way for early 80's punk scene and the Oi! subgenre. Their songs have been covered by many punk, Oi!, and hardcore bands. - Viking is the second and final studio album by the American punk rock band Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards . - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Anti-Heros were an American Oi!/street punk band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

Process: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose higher temperatures occur happens, how will it affect LESS snow. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of higher temperatures has a direct effect on the process of snow formation, resulting in less snow. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky: If temperatures are higher, the evaporation rate will increase. However, this step does not directly impact the amount of snow. 2. Water droplets are in clouds: Higher temperatures might cause more water vapor in the atmosphere due to increased evaporation. This still does not directly impact the amount of snow, although it can have an effect on precipitation in general. 3. The air gets cold: This is a crucial step when it comes to snow formation. If the temperatures are higher, the air might not get cold enough for snow to form. Instead, precipitation might occur in the form of rain or other forms of liquid precipitation. This directly impacts the amount of snow. 4. Water droplets turn into ice crystals: If temperatures are higher, the atmospheric conditions required for water droplets to turn into ice crystals might not be met, preventing the formation of ice crystals and, in turn, snowflakes. This directly affects the amount of snow. 5. Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes: If the previous step is disrupted due to higher temperatures, there will be no ice crystals sticking together to form snowflakes, and subsequently, there will be less snow. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of higher temperatures directly affects the formation of snow by preventing the air from getting cold enough to support the formation of ice crystals and snowflakes. As a result, there will be less snow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Tottenham was a team that had a really good chance to become the number one team in the whole Premier League if they won this game. The Premier League is like a big competition with lots of soccer teams playing against each other, and everyone wants to be the best team in it. So, all the people who liked Tottenham really, really wanted their team to win, so they could be the best team for a while. But West Ham United was a team with some really good soccer players too, and they wanted to show everyone that they could play just as well, or maybe even better! On the day of the big game, lots of people went to Upton Park to watch and cheer for their favorite teams. The soccer players from both teams were really excited and a bit nervous, but they knew they had practiced a lot and were ready to play their best.

Frizz is often caused by dryness, so it's important to restore moisture to your hair in the shower. Always use a sulfate-free shampoo. Sentence: You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair.","completion":"The sentence \\"You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair\\" is generally true, though it can depend on the individual's hair type and the specific sulfate used in a shampoo. It is, however, an appropriate recommendation for most people, as sulfates are known to produce negative effects on certain hair types, especially those prone to frizziness. Sulfates are detergent-like chemicals commonly found in shampoos, which act as surfactants and help create lather. Their primary function is to remove dirt, oils, and buildup from the hair and scalp. The most common sulfates used in shampoos are sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES). While they effectively cleanse the hair and scalp, sulfates have a few downsides that make them problematic for those trying to manage frizzy hair. 1. Sulfates strip natural oils: They can be harsh and strip the hair of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and ultimately damage. This dryness is a common cause of frizziness in hair, as it reduces the hair's ability to retain moisture. 2. Sulfates increase friction between hair strands: The use of sulfate-containing shampoos can increase the friction between the individual hair strands, making it more difficult to detangle and increasing the risk of breakage. This can worsen the appearance of frizziness. 3. Sulfates may irritate the scalp: For some individuals, sulfates can cause irritation and inflammation of the scalp. Inflammation can lead to a disruption in the scalp's natural moisture balance, leading to dryness and frizziness in the hair. By recommending a sulfate-free shampoo, one can mitigate these issues and better preserve the natural oils and moisture levels in the hair. Sulfate-free shampoos use gentler surfactants that cleanse the hair and scalp without stripping away essential oils. These products can be particularly beneficial for those with dry, damaged, or frizzy hair, as they help maintain the hair's moisture balance. However, it's essential to note that not all sulfates are created equal, and some milder sulfate options may not cause as much dryness as others. Additionally, some individuals may not experience the same level of frizziness or dryness when using sulfate-containing products. In conclusion, while the sentence \\"You should never use shampoo that contains sulfates if you want to smooth frizzy hair\\" is broadly accepted as true, it may not apply to everyone or every sulfate-containing shampoo. It is a good rule of thumb to follow, but individuals should consider their specific hair type and needs when choosing the ideal products for their hair care routine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was the first start for quarterback Brock Osweiler, substituting for the injured Peyton Manning. The Broncos grabbed the lead on their initial possession, when Osweiler, playing on his 25th birthday, connected with wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 48-yard touchdown pass. The Bears got on the scoreboard in the second quarter, with two field goals by placekicker Robbie Gould &#8212; from 46 and 37 yards out. The Broncos increased their lead to 10-6, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus as time expired in the second half. Midway through the third quarter, Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan intercepted a pass by Bears' quarterback Jay Cutler deep in Bears' territory. Six plays later, the Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on a 4th-and-goal, however, the Bears' defense prevailed after running back Ronnie Hillman was inadvertently tripped by Owseiler on the hand off at the 2-yard line. The Bears then marched down the field, and another 37-yard field goal by Gould narrowed the Broncos' lead to 10-9 near the end of the third quarter. The Broncos then increased their lead to 17-9 early in the fourth quarter, when Osweiler fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cody Latimer, who was playing in place of the injured Emmanuel Sanders. The Bears once again marched down the field, and were facing a 4th-and-goal from the Broncos' 4-yard line, however, a pass from Cutler to running back Jeremy Langford was broken up by Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib with ten minutes remaining in the game. The Broncos' offense chewed up six minutes of the clock, but were forced to punt, giving the football back to the Bears with 4:23 remaining. On the sixth play of the Bears' next drive, Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a strip sack and fumble off Cutler at the Broncos' 35-yard line, which was recovered by defensive end Malik Jackson with 2:30 remaining. However, the Broncos' offense went three-and-out, though they forced the Bears to burn two of their three team timeouts. Just after the two minute warning, the Bears marched down the field, and finally got into the end zone with only 29 seconds remaining, with Langford lunging for a 2-yard touchdown run. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion running attempt by Langford, which would have tied the game. The Bears' subsequent onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Broncos' offense ran out the clock. NotesThis was the first game this season in which the Broncos' offense did not commit any turnovers. This was Bears' head coach John Fox's first game against the Broncos since mutually parting ways with the Broncos following the end of the 2014 season. It also marked Jay Cutler's first game against the Broncos, who drafted Cutler in the first round of the 2006 draft before he was traded to the Bears prior to the 2009 season. Cutler did not play when the Broncos and Bears last faced each in other in 2011 due to a thumb injury. How many yards longer was the first touchdown than the last one?","completion":"The first touchdown of the game was a 48-yard pass from quarterback Brock Osweiler to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, while the last touchdown of the game was a 2-yard run by running back Jeremy Langford. To find the difference in yardage between the first and last touchdowns, subtract the yardage of the last touchdown from the yardage of the first one: 48 yards (first touchdown) - 2 yards (last touchdown) = 46 yards So, the first touchdown was 46 yards longer than the last one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the urban hubs that are within 6 miles of the ridge that picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge?, using the article: The Metacomet Ridge picks up elevation again with the Pocumtuck Ridge, beginning on Sugarloaf Mountain and the parallel massif of Mount Toby, 1,269 feet (387 m), the high point of the Metacomet Ridge geography. Both Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby are composed of erosion-resistant sedimentary rock. North of Mount Sugarloaf, the Pocumtuck Ridge continues as alternating sedimentary and traprock dominated strata to Greenfield, Massachusetts. From Greenfield north to 2 miles (3 km) short of the Vermont–New Hampshire–Massachusetts tri-border, the profile of the Metacomet Ridge diminishes into a series of nondescript hills and low, wooded mountain peaks composed of sedimentary rock with dwindling traprock outcrops.In Connecticut, the high point of the Metacomet Ridge is West Peak of the Hanging Hills at 1,024 feet (312 m); in Massachusetts, the highest traprock peak is Mount Tom, 1,202 feet (366 m), although Mount Toby, made of sedimentary rock, is higher. Visually, the Metacomet Ridge is narrowest at Provin Mountain and East Mountain in Massachusetts where it is less than 0.5 miles (1 km) wide; it is widest at Totoket Mountain, over 4 miles (6 km). However, low parallel hills and related strata along much of the range often make the actual geologic breadth of the Metacomet Ridge wider than the more noticeable ridgeline crests, up to 10 miles (16 km) across in some areas. Significant river drainages of the Metacomet Ridge include the Connecticut River and tributaries (Falls River, Deerfield River, Westfield River, Farmington River, Coginchaug River); and, in southern Connecticut, the Quinnipiac River.The Metacomet Ridge is surrounded by rural wooded, agricultural, and suburban landscapes, and is no more than 6 miles (10 km) from a number of urban hubs such as New Haven, Meriden, New Britain, Hartford, and Springfield. Small city centers abutting the ridge include Greenfield, Northampton, Amherst, Holyoke, West Hartford, Farmington, Wallingford, and Hamden., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Moby Dick crush after dodging the nukes? The Pequod Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Moby and the Apocalypse\\" Genre: Sci-fi/Adventure Plot Outline: In a not-so-distant technologically advanced future, a radical organization orchestrates a dangerous plan to reignite the hunt for Moby Dick – the legendary great white whale. The group threatens international peace by fueling nuclear tensions between powerful nations. Their ultimate goal is to coerce the world into using nuclear weapons to force the ultimate showdown between man and beast. They believe that victory over Moby Dick can grant them global dominance and herald them as the ultimate saviors. World governments are caught in a nuclear arms race, and the hunt for Moby Dick intensifies. Sensing the urgency of the situation, a fearless crew led by the seasoned Captain Ahab, embarks on the \\"Pequod\\" – a modern, heavily armed ship designed for aquatic battles – to face the infamous whale in the watery battlefield. The aquatic war unfolds in dramatic pursuit, with numerous maritime vessels and submarines converging in an unforgiving, stormy ocean. As they trail the relentless beast, Moby Dick displays an uncanny intelligence, evading the nuclear bombardment through incredible displays of agility, speed, and stealth. Tensions rise as the crew of the Pequod witnesses the immensity and sheer power of Moby Dick for the first time. In a daring and unexpected move, Moby Dick surfaces near the Pequod and engages the vessel before anyone can react. Using its massive tail and jaw, the whale wreaks havoc on the ship, taking down helicopters on the deck, crushing weaponry, and carrying out a deadly rendezvous. Moby Dick doesn't escape unscathed; it sustains critical damage from the Pequod's advanced weapons, but it manages to incapacitate the ship's nuclear arsenal. In the climactic battle between the Pequod and Moby Dick, Captain Ahab and his crew find themselves at the mercy of the immense whale, as conventional weapons prove to be less effective. In a twist of fate, a rival crewmember, Ishmael, discovers an unusual connection with the great white beast – he can communicate empathically with Moby Dick. Moby Dick and the crew of the Pequod reach an uneasy truce, and they band together to stop the impending global nuclear catastrophe. With the whale's intelligence and unique abilities, they thwart the radical organization's plan and force them to expose their sinister plot to the world. The nuclear trigger is averted, and the nations converge to dismantle the group and restore peace. In the aftermath, Moby Dick, now an ally and protector, returns to the depths of the ocean. The crew of the Pequod, led by a redeemed Ahab and Ishmael, devote themselves to safeguarding a harmonious relationship between humans and marine life. The legend of Moby Dick resonates throughout the world as a powerful symbol of unity and understanding, as a new age of cooperation and co-existence begins in the balance of the terrestrial and aquatic realms. \\"Moby and the Apocalypse\\" is a tale of unlikely alliances, gigantic challenges, and the relentless quest for peace in the face of global turbulence. It blends classic literature with futuristic technology, exploring the complexity of human relationships, our connection to nature, and the unimaginable power within all species to unite against unimaginable threats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
