It's -4*b + 4*b = 27*b - 162. We need to find the value of \\"b\\". First, let's look at the left side of the equation: -4*b + 4*b. Since we have a -4 of something and add 4 of the same thing, we actually have nothing, because -4 plus 4 equals 0. So, our equation becomes: 0 = 27*b - 162. Now, we need to make \\"b\\" all by itself to find out its value. To do that, we should move the -162 over to the other side with 0. We can think of this like we are adding 162 to both sides of the equation. So, our equation now looks like this: 162 = 27*b. The last step we need to do is to make \\"b\\" all by itself. Right now, the equation says 27 times \\"b\\" equals 162. To find the value of \\"b\\", we need to divide both sides by 27. So, we get: b = 162 ÷ 27. Now let's do the division: 162 ÷ 27 = 6. So, the value of \\"b\\" is 6. That's our answer! Good job on solving this math problem together!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The clones in Rebecca's garden turned out much better than in Angela's because","completion":"The clones in Rebecca's garden turned out much better than in Angela's because Rebecca had devoted more time and effort into researching and implementing the ideal growing conditions for the specific plants she was cloning. This resulted in a higher success rate of healthy and vibrant clones. Step 1: Assess and Review Rebecca started by carefully assessing the plants she wanted to clone, taking note of their light, water, temperature, and soil requirements. She also researched the plants' natural habitat to ensure she was providing as close to their ideal environment as possible. This helped set the foundation for a successful cloning process. Step 2: Prepare Infrastructure Once she understood the specific needs of her plants, Rebecca moved on to the next step - preparing the necessary infrastructure. This included setting up the right-sized pots, ensuring proper drainage systems, and investing in suitable grow lights to mimic the natural sunlight they require. Step 3: Propagate Cuttings Rebecca took healthy cuttings from her mother plants, ensuring they were disease-free, had adequate shoot length, and an appropriate number of nodes for better root development in her cloned plants. She carefully cleaned the cuttings and dipped them into a rooting hormone to facilitate the growth of strong roots. Step 4: Prepare Soil Rebecca prepared a soil mix that was specifically designed for the plants she was cloning. This meant including the right balance of nutrients, minerals, and texture to aid in moisture retention without suffocating the plants. She filled each pot with the prepared soil mix, ensuring that it was neither too loose nor too compact. Step 5: Plant Cuttings Cautiously, Rebecca planted the cuttings into the prepared pots. She buried the nodes of the cutting to secure them in place and watered the soil gently to saturate the roots. While doing so, she was careful not to dislodge the cuttings or cause any damage to the new roots. Step 6: Monitor and Provide Care Once the cuttings were planted, Rebecca began monitoring and caring for her clones daily. She adhered to the specific light, water, and temperature requirements and adjusted the environment accordingly as the plants grew. She made sure to keep the humidity levels in check to avoid the development of mold or other issues. Step 7: Observe and Learn Finally, Rebecca paid close attention to her clones' progress, observing their growth rates, health, and overall success. She took notes on any obstacles or challenges faced and used this learning to fine-tune her cloning process further, resulting in healthier and more vibrant clones in her garden. In contrast, Angela had not taken the same measures, leading to poorer outcomes for her clones. Rebecca's attention to detail, proper research, and ongoing care contributed to the significant difference in the success and quality of the clones between the two gardens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Matthew A:","completion":"Title: A Journey to Remember Genre: Drama, Mystery, Romance Plot Summary: Francesca, a talented and fiercely independent artist, wakes up one day with no memories of her past. The only thing she knows is her own name and a vague feeling that she needs to find someone. As shards of memory slowly piece together, Francesca discovers that she must find her husband, Matthew – a man she cannot recall, yet feels a strong emotional connection to. The quest to learn about Matthew and reclaim her past takes Francesca on a soul-searching journey, leading her to question the nature of love, the importance of trust, and the value of self-discovery. Act 1: The movie opens with Francesca waking up in a small town hotel with no recollection of who she is or how she got there. The hotel owner, Judy, provides her with a room key with a scribbled note revealing her first name. Francesca discovers her artistic talent through drawings and sketches left behind in her room, which seem to contain enigmatic clues about her past and the life she has forgotten. As Francesca spends more time in the town, she becomes friendly with the locals, such as the kind-hearted police officer, Tony, and the enigmatic bookshop owner, Linda. They tell her stories of a woman named Francesca, who was rumored to have a tumultuous yet passionate marriage to a man named Matthew. Intrigued and desperate for answers, she decides to follow the trail of clues hidden within her artwork to learn more about Matthew and her past life. Act 2: Using her art as a guide, Francesca uncovers more information about the life she and Matthew shared together. Each new discovery – their love for foreign films, a shared apprehension about starting a family, Matthew's strong connection with their dog, Sam – makes her feel closer to him. The more she learns, the more she becomes determined to meet him again, even if it means confronting their deeply buried conflicts. When Francesca learns that Matthew moved away to start a new life after her abrupt disappearance, she sets out on a cross-country trip to find him. Along the way, she grapples with the decisions she made in her past – some painting her as a staunchly independent woman battling societal expectations and others revealing her struggles with commitment and long-lasting love. Act 3: In the seaside town where Matthew now resides, Francesca finally finds Matthew living with a new partner, Julie, who is pregnant with his child. As she watches them from afar, Francesca struggles with the conflicting emotions of joy, pain, and a sense of longing – seeing the life she could have had if circumstances were different. After a heart-wrenching internal debate, Francesca decides to confront Matthew and reveal her true identity. When they meet, the connection they share is palpable, and Matthew is torn between his commitment to his new life with Julie and the undeniable love he still feels for Francesca. With time running out and the weight of the past heavy on their shoulders, Francesca and Matthew partake in a heart-wrenching goodbye, knowing that their love story has reached its end. Epilogue: Upon returning to her small town, Francesca embraces her newfound self-awareness and dedicates herself to building a new life. She opens an art gallery, which gains critical acclaim, and to her surprise, finds happiness in her independence and self-sufficiency. The film concludes with Francesca standing on a beach, reflecting on her journey and the choices she made. As she watches the sunset, she understands that while the mystery of Matthew may have defined her past, her future is hers alone to create. 'A Journey to Remember' is both an emotional and introspective movie that showcases personal growth, self-discovery, and the power of love despite the passage of time and struggles of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Suspect Zero Movie plot: FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) has been put on leave for 6 months, demoted, and reassigned to Albuquerque, because he violated the civil rights of a serial killer, Raymond Starkey. Starkey was living in Mexico at the time, when Mackelway brought him back to America in the trunk of his car. Starkey was eventually set free upon the world. Mackelway arrives in Albuquerque, and his first case is the murder of a traveling salesman, Harold Speck, who has a zero mark on his body. The FBI was called to the scene, because the body was in a car located just across the state line. Soon afterwards, he investigates two other murders. Raymond Starkey was the third victim. All the victims had the same zero mark on their body.At first, the murders looked random, and then Mackelway begins to connect the dots. The victims are all serial killers, and someone is going around killing them. He gets a lead that Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) may have some connection to the murders, and he begins to track down O'Ryan. He finds out that O'Ryan was once an FBI agent with special skills, trained to use 'remote viewing' to see what the serial killer sees.

Article: It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house. My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, \\"Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son.\\" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years. We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, \\"Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!\\" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed. It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a vast and pristine region located in northeastern Alaska along the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Established in 1960 and expanded in 1980, the refuge spans over 19.64 million acres (79,559 square kilometers), making it the largest national wildlife refuge in the United States. Its primary purpose is to conserve and protect unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values in the area. Within the refuge, there is a variety of ecosystems that sustain a myriad of plant and animal species. The area is divided into five distinct regions, each offering a unique habitat for various wildlife: 1. The Coastal Plain: Bordering the Arctic Ocean, the coastal plain comprises about 1.5 million acres and is the primary breeding ground for many migratory birds and caribou. This area is often referred to as the \\"biological heart\\" of the refuge because of its significance to wildlife reproduction. The porcupine caribou herd, in particular, depends on this area for calving. 2. The Brooks Range: A mountainous area in the center of the refuge, the Brooks Range provides habitat for species such as Dall sheep, grizzly bears, and wolves. These mountains cover approximately 4.2 million acres of the refuge, where rugged peaks and river valleys provide a stunning backdrop to the region. 3. The Arctic Foothills: Spread across 3.2 million acres, the Arctic Foothills are a mix of rolling hills and river valleys that provide habitats mainly for caribou, moose, and muskoxen. These lands serve as essential corridors for various wildlife migrations. 4. The Boreal Forest: Covering about 4.1 million acres, the boreal forest is comprised of white and black spruce trees, birch, willow, and alder. This region offers habitats for several mammal species such as moose, lynx, marten, and wolverine. The boreal forest is also essential for nesting bird species, like the threatened Northern Goshawk and the Olive-sided Flycatcher. 5. The Interior Marshes and Lakes: Providing an essential habitat for waterfowl and migratory birds, these wetlands cover nearly 6.7 million acres of the refuge. In the summer, numerous bird species, including the threatened Spectacled Eider, make use of this area for nesting and raising their young. Within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, there are various environmental protections and designated Wilderness areas that safeguard these unique ecosystems and species. Most notably, over 7 million acres are designated as Wilderness under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, making it one of the largest protected wilderness regions in the U.S. This designation ensures that the area remains unaltered by commercial or industrial activities, allowing the natural ecosystems and wildlife populations to thrive undisturbed. In conclusion, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a significant and valuable region for preserving unique wildlife and wilderness values on Alaska's north coast. Spanning nearly 19.64 million acres, this vast and diverse area offers a wide range of habitats for numerous plant and animal species. By enforcing environmental protections and wilderness designation, the refuge ensures the conservation and survival of the ecosystems and wildlife present within this special area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Background: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. Paragraph: Pam and Mary were two gardener friends. They both had some aphid infestations, but Mary had more aphids on her farm, so she used every method and insecticide available to get rid of them, with limited success.

Elton John: Russia's homosexuality propaganda laws are deeply dangerous to LGBT community Elton John's letter to Russia: it is very disappointing that the law explicitly links homosexuality with child sex abuse Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters One month after performing in the Russian cities of Moscow and Kazan, Sir Elton John has published a letter on his website, eltonjohn.com, calling for Russia to drop its \\"homosexual propaganda\\" law and change the way it treats its citizens. Here the singer recalls the stories of Russian fans who had been threatened, insulted and attacked for being gay: I am deeply grateful for the support of the Russian people who have welcomed and accepted me in their country ever since I first visited in 1979. On my last visit, in December 2013, I wondered whether the new legislation banning \\"homosexual propaganda\\" might have changed that. It hadn't. I still felt the same warmth and welcome from the audiences that I have felt every time I have been in Russia. On that trip I met with members of the LGBT community in Moscow. Although I was still welcomed as an openly gay foreigner, I wanted to really understand at first-hand what difference the legislation had made to Russian LGBT in their own country. What I heard reinforced all the media stories that have been circling since the propaganda bill became federal law: that vicious homophobia has been legitimised by this legislation and given extremists the cover to abuse people's basic human rights. The people I met in Moscow – gay men and lesbians in their 20′s, 30′s and 40′s - told me stories about receiving threats from vigilante groups who would 'cure' them of homosexuality by dousing them with urine or beating them up. One young man was stalked outside a gay club by someone posing as a taxi driver who tried to garrotte him with a guitar string because he was a \\"sodomite\\". Everyone shared stories of verbal and physical abuse – at work, in bars and restaurants or in the street – since the legislation came into force last June. And, some of the vital work providing HIV prevention information to the gay community has been labelled \\"homosexual propaganda\\" and shut down. It was very clear to me that, although foreigners like myself who are visiting Russia are not affected by this new law (and President Putin has recently confirmed this), it is a very different story for those living inside the country. As Maria Maksakova told her fellow Russian MPs last month: \\"We are seeing extremely negative consequences as a result of this law, with the growth of hate crimes.\\" President Putin asserts that this was not the intention, but it is undoubtedly the effect that this law has had by promoting misunderstanding and ignorance. In particular, it is very disappointing that the law explicitly links homosexuality with child sex abuse, which countless studies have shown to be conclusively wrong. The people I met in Moscow were decent, kind, patriotic men and women who had no thought of forcing their sexuality on anyone. Whatever the intention of Russia's homosexuality and paedophilia propaganda laws, I am absolutely clear from my own personal experience that it is proving deeply dangerous to the LGBT community and deeply divisive to Russian society. I would welcome the opportunity to introduce President Putin to some Russians who deserve to be heard, and who deserve to be treated in their own country with the same respect and warm welcome that I received on my last visit.

On July 19, Morgan Stanley sold 2 billion of senior unsecured notes, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters service. Morgan Stanley acted as the sole bookrunning manager for the sale. The sale of senior unsecured notes is a method used by organizations to raise capital, and these notes are obligations that the company promises to repay in accordance with the details outlined in the borrowing terms. Here is a summary of the transaction details provided: - Borrower: Morgan Stanley - Amount: 2 billion - Coupon: 6.375% - Maturity: July 24, 2042 - Type: Senior Notes (Sr Nts) - Issuance Price: 98.867 - First Payment: January 24, 2013 - Ratings: Moody's (Baa1), S&P (A-), Fitch (Single-A) - Yield: 6.461% - Settlement Date: July 24, 2012 - Spread: 387.5 basis points - Payment Frequency: Semi-annual - Non-callable status: N/A Since Morgan Stanley sold the senior unsecured notes and raised 2 billion through this transaction, this indicates that the company did not liquidate their position. Instead, it appears that they sought to raise additional capital by selling these unsecured notes. The fact that the issuance was a note sale rather than a liquidation of assets suggests that the company maintained its overall position and possibly used the proceeds from the sale to continue operations, invest in strategic projects, or pay down existing debts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the premise - Ca'daan is the subject - Looking nervously is the action (likely indicating some sort of concern or distress) - A body laying face up on the side of the path is what the action is directed towards Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis - He (referring to Ca'daan in this context) is the subject - Recognized is the action (implying previous acquaintance or familiarity) - The person is what the action is directed towards (referring to the body in the premise) Step 3: Compare the two statements - Both statements involve Ca'daan and the body/person - The premise is focused on Ca'daan's reaction to seeing the body (looking nervously) - The hypothesis is focused on whether Ca'daan recognizes the body as a particular person Step 4: Evaluate the entailment - The premise does not contain any information about Ca'daan recognizing the person, only that he is looking nervously at the body - The hypothesis is not directly supported by the information given in the premise Conclusion: The premise \\"Ca'daan looked nervously at a body laying face up on one side of the path\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"He recognized the person.\\" While the nervous reaction might suggest some sort of familiarity or concern, there is not enough information provided in the premise to definitively conclude that Ca'daan recognized the person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\", answer the following question.

The thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip. Wondering what the thieves want with a remote control car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to someone. The thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"pesticides can cause what to be destroyed?\\" is \\"swamp vegetation\\", given that pesticides can cause entire ecosystems to be destroyed?","completion":"Yes, I believe the right answer to the question \\"pesticides can cause what to be destroyed?\\" can indeed be \\"swamp vegetation\\" when considering that pesticides have the potential to cause significant harm to entire ecosystems. However, it is essential to understand that the detrimental impact of pesticides extends far beyond swamp vegetation and encompasses various components of an ecosystem. In order to provide a more comprehensive understanding, let us delve deeper into the potential consequences of pesticide use on ecosystems, including the damage it causes to swamp vegetation. Swamp vegetation is a critical component of wetland ecosystems that provide numerous ecological functions and services, such as water purification, flood control, carbon storage, and habitat for diverse plant and animal species. When pesticides are used in agricultural or other pest-control practices, they can contaminate nearby water bodies and wetlands due to runoff, spray drift, or leaching. As these chemicals reach swamps, they can have multiple adverse effects on the vegetation and overall ecosystem health. 1. Direct toxicity to plants: Some pesticides can be directly toxic to swamp vegetation, affecting their growth, reproduction, and survival. Plants may experience reduced photosynthesis, altered nutrient uptake, and hampered seed germination. Sensitive plant species may decline or even disappear from contaminated swamps, leading to shifts in plant community composition and diversity. 2. Indirect effects through altered biogeochemical processes: Pesticides can influence biogeochemical processes in swamps, such as nutrient cycling and decomposition, thereby diminishing the overall productivity and resilience of these ecosystems. For instance, certain pesticides can reduce the abundance and diversity of microbial decomposers and alter the decomposition rates of organic matter, which can indirectly affect the nutrient availability and growth of swamp vegetation. 3. Impact on plant-pollinator interactions: Pesticides can also disrupt plant-pollinator interactions by reducing the number or diversity of pollinators in swamps, which can result in decreased plant reproduction and the subsequent loss of plant species. 4. Harm to non-target organisms at multiple trophic levels: Pesticides can negatively impact non-target organisms, such as aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals, which are essential for maintaining the balance and functioning of swamp ecosystems. For example, the decline of predators and herbivores due to pesticide exposure can result in altered food-web dynamics, leading to cascading effects on other species, including swamp vegetation. While it is accurate to say that swamp vegetation can be destroyed by pesticides, it is essential to recognize that pesticides can have far-reaching consequences on the abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems beyond swamp vegetation alone. In order to maintain the integrity of ecosystems and preserve their essential ecological services, there must be a greater emphasis on adopting sustainable agricultural practices, implementing integrated pest management strategies, and limiting the use of harmful pesticides. Through these measures, we can work towards preserving not only swamp vegetation but also the countless other organisms and processes that make up the interconnected web of life within ecosystems."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Aaron was desperately trying to avoid eating candies but Craig was not because","completion":"Craig had always been a big fan of sweets. From a very young age, Craig's love for the sugary delights was insatiable, and his friends often joked that he was single-handedly keeping the local candy shop in business. His all-time favorite category of treats was candies, which came in all sizes, colors, and flavors. Candies became a staple in his everyday life, as sharing them with others brought not only joy, but also a sense of connection and camaraderie amongst his peers. Aaron, on the other hand, was quite the opposite. His parents had instilled in him the importance of maintaining a healthy diet and avoiding excessive sugar intake. From a young age, Aaron was taught to relish the natural sweetness of fruits and opt for healthier dessert options whenever possible. As he grew older, Aaron began to understand the impact of this lifestyle on his overall health and energy levels. He noticed how he didn't suffer from the same sugar crashes or cavities that plagued many of his friends. Though their views on candy consumption drastically differed, Aaron and Craig managed to maintain a close friendship. They often discussed their thoughts and opinions regarding health and nutrition, which only strengthened their bond by offering diverse perspectives. This dynamic, however, was not without its challenges. One faithful day, as the two friends met in the charmingly chaotic park beside the local candy store, Craig gleefully presented Aaron with a large bag filled to the brim with his favorite candies. Craig's intentions were simple – as a genuine friend, he wanted to share the joy and sweetness derived from these tiny treats with Aaron. However, Aaron, fully aware of the consequences of indulging, felt torn between the urge to uphold his principles and the temptation to finally taste the candies that seemed to bring Craig so much happiness. Craig, oblivious to Aaron's inner conflict, enthusiastically urged him to try some, insisting that \\"one little candy won't hurt.\\" Aaron's hesitation grew increasingly palpable, his mind racing between the familiar reassurance of his health-conscious values and his curiosity about the candy experience. He considered the likelihood of spiraling into a sugar-induced frenzy, thereby leading to an inevitable crash that would jeopardize his health and well-being, at least for a day. As the sunlight danced through the colorful autumn leaves decorating the park, Aaron finally mustered the courage to address the situation. He decided that, as both a gesture of goodwill and an opportunity to experience all facets of life, he would allow himself to try just one candy. With a nervous smile, he expressed his gratitude to Craig and reached into the bag, carefully selecting a glistening, perfectly-shaped piece of candy. It was not just the flavors that exploded in Aaron's mouth as he bit into the candy, but also the floodgate of emotions: joy, excitement, fear, and guilt. As he chewed, the initial burst of sweetness quickly gave way to an overwhelming sense of appreciation for his friendship with Craig. In that moment, Aaron realized that life's simple, shared pleasures can transcend even the strictest of personal convictions. Undeniably, the taste of the candy was exquisite, an experience worth appreciating. Still, Aaron decided that he wouldn't make candied indulgence a habit. While he now understood the allure of those sweet treats, he also gained a deeper insight into the importance of balance and moderation – the ability to merge his own beliefs and boundaries with the joy and connection that comes from opening oneself up to new experiences with friends. As for Craig, he felt both validated by Aaron's positive response and humbled by his friend's measured approach. Recognizing the power of moderation, Craig promised to be more mindful of his own candy consumption and explore healthier options, following Aaron's lead. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow across the park as Aaron and Craig strolled home together. Their friendship, now stronger than ever, was a testament to the importance of understanding, respect, and compromise. And as they say, variety is the spice of life – so too did this experience add a delicious dimension of depth to the bond between these two friends, forever enriched by their sweet adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Based on the premise \\"Could this anti-missile insurance policy reawaken a Cold War confrontation thought dead, lo, these past 10 years?\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Could a Cold War kind of problem begin with this anti-missle philosophy?\\" is true?","completion":"To examine the hypothesis \\"Could a Cold War kind of problem begin with this anti-missile philosophy?\\" based on the given premise, we must first analyze the components of the hypothesis and understand them at their core. A Cold War situation refers to a period of intense political and military rivalry between two or more nations, involving covert operations, espionage, propaganda, and proxy wars, characterized mainly by the lack of direct armed engagement between the nations involved. The premise refers to an \\"anti-missile insurance policy,\\" which presumably refers to a defensive strategy incorporating missile defense systems to intercept and destroy incoming enemy missiles before they can reach their intended targets. Such a policy would be implemented to provide increased security for a nation against potential missile threats from one or more adversaries. It is also essential to understand the context and conditions of the era that marked the end of the Cold War roughly ten years ago. The end of the Cold War was characterized by the fall of the Soviet Union and the easing of tensions between the United States and Russia. Many of the arms control treaties and international diplomatic efforts that emerged during the post-Cold War era were aimed at reducing nuclear arsenals, encouraging transparency, and maintaining a fragile peace between the superpowers. Delving into the hypothesis, the primary contention is that the implementation of an anti-missile policy could potentially reawaken tensions and confrontation reminiscent of the Cold War era. To evaluate the plausibility of this hypothesis, we can consider three main factors: 1. The perception of endorsement of an anti-missile policy by one nation to the other: If one nation perceives the anti-missile policy as an aggressive or preemptive measure by the other, this could raise tensions and trigger a chain reaction of military build-up and expansion of missile and defense capabilities on both sides. The situation could resemble the arms race that characterized the Cold War, with each nation one-upping the other in a bid to maintain or gain an advantage. 2. The impact on existing arms control treaties and diplomacy: An anti-missile policy could be seen as undermining or even violating existing arms control treaties between nations. This could severely strain diplomatic relations and weaken the trust established in the post-Cold War era. The political fallout from such a scenario could push nations back into confrontation reminiscent of Cold War times. 3. The potential for an arms race to develop: The introduction of a new anti-missile policy could set the stage for a new arms race between nations, as they try to develop more advanced technologies to counter their adversaries' defenses. This would have both nations investing heavily in their military capabilities, thus driving them towards a conflict similar to the Cold War rivalry once again. Considering these factors, the hypothesis that a Cold War kind of problem could begin with the development and implementation of an anti-missile policy is plausible. The premise suggests that the perception and response to such a policy could set off a chain of events that lead to increased tensions, an arms race, and a deterioration of diplomatic relations between nations, potentially reawakening a Cold War-like confrontation.

A chilling audio recording of a phone call likely made by Newtown killer Adam Lanza to a radio show a year before his deadly rampage gives a terrifying look inside the 20-year-old's sick mind. Lanza apparently spoke on Oregon college radio show Anarchy Radio on December 11, 2011 and compared a chimpanzee that famously tore off the face a Connecticut woman to a human mass killer. 'I just... don't think it would be such a stretch to say that he very well could have been a teenage mall shooter or something like that,' he said about Travis the chimp in a recording, which was first reported by Sandy Hook Lighthouse. Although he disguised his voice and used the name","completion":"\\"Greg\\" during the call, multiple sources have confirmed that the voice was indeed Lanza's. The nearly 7-minute-long conversation provides a glimpse into the mind of a deeply troubled young man, who would later commit one of the most horrifying mass shootings in American history. During the call, Lanza drew parallels between the violent behavior of Travis the chimp and the actions of mass killers. He expressed his belief that both were driven by a sort of \\"civilizing\\" impulse, suggesting that they recognized the ills of society and yearned for a world free from the constraints of social norms and expectations. \\"Maybe there is some sort of existential crisis that occurs, where one can no longer deny the aggression and desire for destruction that exists within them,\\" Lanza hypothesized, in an unsettlingly calm and dispassionate tone. \\"And perhaps that is what drives these individuals to act on their violent impulses in such an extreme manner.\\" It was chilling to hear Lanza's voice, knowing that he would later become a mass killer himself. The phone call demonstrated that Lanza had been contemplating the nature of violence and devastation long before he carried out the Sandy Hook massacre on December 14, 2012, where he shot and killed 26 people, including 20 first-grade children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Investigators have had difficulty piecing together a motive for Lanza's attack, as he left behind little in the way of explanation. However, the phone call offers some insight into his preoccupations and thought processes leading up to the tragedy. He appeared fixated on violence, even going so far as to research and analyze various incidents of brutality and barbarism. Furthermore, the fact that Lanza chose to call into Anarchy Radio demonstrated a specific interest in anarchist ideals, which often promote the overthrow of existing systems and institutions in favor of total freedom and autonomy. This could suggest that Lanza harbored deep feelings of alienation and resentment toward the world around him, leading to an eventual eruption of unfathomable violence. Ultimately, the chilling audio recording serves as a disturbing reminder that there was more to Lanza than met the eye. Although his actions will forever be remembered as inhumane and deplorable, the phone call suggests that he was not merely a cold-blooded killer, but rather a complex and deeply disturbed individual struggling to make sense of his own violent desires and a world that he found oppressive and suffocating. As we continue to grapple with the nature of such atrocities, it is vital that we try to understand the underlying factors that drive individuals like Lanza to commit such heinous acts. Only through increasing our knowledge and awareness can we hope to prevent further tragedies and help those who might be struggling with similar feelings of disillusionment and despair."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia 10 million plus 250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve.

Hoodoo Gurus (referred to as the Gurus by fans) are an Australian rock band, formed in Sydney in 1981, by the mainstay Dave Faulkner (songwriter, lead singer and guitarist) and later joined by Richard Grossman (bass), Mark Kingsmill (drums), and Brad Shepherd (guitar, vocals, harmonica). Their popularity peaked in the mid to late 1980s with albums Mars Needs Guitars!, Blow Your Cool! and Magnum Cum Louder. They followed Kinky with Crank in 1994. The 'Crank' world tour took the Gurus through USA, Canada, Europe and included a one-month tour of Brazil. Faulkner also composed the soundtrack to Laurie McInnes' 1994 feature film Broken Highway. In 1995, the Gurus collaborated with The Masters Apprentices frontman Jim Keays on an updated rendition of \\"Turn Up Your Radio\\". The song was included on a new Masters' Best of album, as well as being issued as a single. In 1996 they moved to Mushroom Records for the release of their next album, Blue Cave. The band then undertook a national tour of Australian tour with US outfit The Posies and local band Drop City. Touring commitments were curtailed when Kingsmill severed tendons and nerves in his arm as a result of an onstage accident. Once Kingsmill recovered, the Gurus completed their 'Circus Maximus' Australian tour by end of 1996. In January 1997, Faulkner announced that the band would be breaking up in December. March was the Gurus undertake another tour of Brazil, where they played a concert in front of 40,000 people. The Gurus commenced their final Australian tour, the three-month 'Spit the Dummy' tour, in October 1997. The tour coincided with the release of the double compilation album Armchair Gurus/Electric Chair, which made No. 29 on the national chart. The band played its final show in Melbourne on 11 January 1998. The show made up for dates missed during December 1997, when Faulkner was ill. In November 1998 Mushroom had issued the Hoodoo Gurus' live album, Bite the Bullet. The songs had been recorded during the band's 'Spit the Dummy' farewell tour. The standard, single album version was joined by a limited edition, triple CD version subtitled Director's Cut. It included the additional CDs, Doppelganger (a collection of live-to-air Broadcasts from between 1983-1996) and Bubble and Squeak (a collection of outtakes and oddities).

Plot title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Here is a question about this article: A central teaching of Jehovah's Witnesses is that the current world era, or \\"system of things\\", entered the \\"last days\\" in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ, leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably. They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with \\"Babylon the Great\\", or the \\"harlot\\", of Revelation 17, and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations, which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet-colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17. This development will mark the beginning of the \\"great tribulation\\". Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon, during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's \\"sheep\\", or true followers, will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth, which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden. After Armageddon, most of those who had died before God's intervention will gradually be resurrected during \\"judgment day\\" lasting for one thousand years. This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, Christ will hand all authority back to God. Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind. Those who fail will be destroyed, along with Satan and his demons. The end result will be a fully tested, glorified human race. What is the answer to this question: What will be the end result of God's kingdom?","completion":"The end result of God's kingdom, according to Jehovah's Witnesses' teachings, will be a fully tested, glorified human race. This outcome is reached through a series of events, starting with the destruction of false religions and the beginning of the \\"great tribulation.\\" Following this, the war of Armageddon will occur, during which all forms of government and people who are not considered true followers of Christ, or his \\"sheep,\\" will be destroyed. After Armageddon, God's heavenly kingdom will expand to include Earth, and the planet will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden. Those who had died before God's intervention will be resurrected during the \\"judgment day,\\" which lasts for one thousand years. It is important to note that their judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than their past deeds. Once the thousand years are over, Christ will hand all authority back to God. At this point, the final test will take place as Satan is released one last time to try and mislead perfect mankind. Those who fail this test will be destroyed along with Satan and his demons. The story concludes with the achievement of a fully tested, glorified human race that has proven its loyalty and obedience to God. These individuals will live in a harmonious and perfect world, inhabiting a paradise on Earth under the rule of God and Christ. This ultimate goal reflects the central premise of Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs - that through divine intervention, Earth will become a utopia where true followers will enjoy eternal happiness and peace."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Step 1: find the id of station table for which long greater than 37.4. Step 2: find the station_id of status table for which bikes_available less than 7. Step 3: show the rows that are in both the results of step 1 and the results of step 2 Output:","completion":"Part #1: Find the id of the station table for which long is greater than 37.4 Usage: SELECT id FROM station WHERE long > 37.4; This query selects the id column from the station table where the long column value is greater than 37.4. Part #2: Find the station_id of status table for which bikes_available is less than 7 Usage: SELECT station_id FROM status WHERE bikes_available < 7; This query selects the station_id column from the status table where the bikes_available column value is less than 7. Part #3: Show the rows that are in both the results of step 1 and the results of step 2 Usage: SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM station WHERE long > 37.4) AS station_result JOIN (SELECT station_id FROM status WHERE bikes_available < 7) AS status_result ON station_result.id = status_result.station_id; This query joins the results of the first two parts, selecting all the columns from both.

' he lightly pinched her cheek and smiled . \` now smile back at me because we 're going to have a happy day together . ' she did smile back , intensely relieved that he did n't see her as similar to serena , despite their deal , which was still in","completion":"place. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION: The sentence presents a dialogue between two characters, one named Daisy and the other referred to as \\"he.\\" The unnamed male character seems to have a close relationship with Daisy, as evident by their physical contact when he lightly pinches her cheek and their emotional connection through conversation. The dialogue reveals that Daisy might have been concerned about being compared to someone named Serena, and the male character's words reassure her that she is not. The male character's statement \\"not for yourself, Daisy\\" and the phrase \\"your character is so far removed from Serena's, it's like night and day\\" are the linchpins for understanding the context of their conversation. The comparison of their personalities being like night and day suggests that Daisy and Serena have opposite qualities, possibly in terms of their morals or behavior. Another aspect worth examining is the nature of the \\"deal\\" mentioned in the sentence. It is not explicitly stated what this deal might entail; however, one can infer from the context that the deal might create a sense of discomfort or tension for Daisy, making her relieved when the male character confirms that he doesn't see her as similar to Serena. Furthermore, it's interesting that the male character asks Daisy to smile back at him and assures her they will have a happy day together. This implies that he has a caring and supportive demeanor and possibly wants to improve Daisy's mood. Daisy's intense relief at his response suggests she looks up to him and values his opinion. Considering the information provided, it can be inferred that the relationship between Daisy and the unnamed male character is a significant one, and the characters might have a certain level of concern for each other's emotional well-being. POSSIBLE CONTINUATION: The day passed smoothly, with Daisy feeling a newfound sense of comfort in her interaction with the male character. They shared laughter and meaningful conversations throughout the day, only adding to the strengthening of their bond. Each moment reassured Daisy that the deal, however troubling it might be, did not change the way he regarded her as an individual. As the day neared its end, Daisy mustered the courage to ask him about the nature of their deal, and why it seemed to weigh so heavily on her conscience. A serious expression washed over his face, as he pondered what to say. The unspoken when it came to the deal seemed to have a significant impact on both of them. With a sigh, he reluctantly explained the reasons for the deal, which related to a bitter rivalry between Daisy's and Serena's families. It was a clandestine arrangement that held uncertain consequences, all for reasons Daisy couldn't quite comprehend. Upon learning the truth, she felt conflicted, but her trust in the male character remained unwavering. With newfound determination, Daisy chose to face the consequences head-on, knowing that it would be a difficult road ahead. The male character, standing by her side, smiled reassuringly, confident that together, they would overcome any obstacle, even if it involved the enigmatic Serena and her family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Middle Platonism is the modern name given to a stage in the development of Platonic philosophy, lasting from about 90 BC when Antiochus of Ascalon rejected the scepticism of the New Academy until the development of Neoplatonism under Plotinus in the 3rd century. Middle Platonism absorbed many doctrines from the rival Peripatetic and Stoic schools. The pre-eminent philosopher in this period, Plutarch (c. 45-120), defended the freedom of the will and the immortality of the soul. He sought to show that God, in creating the world, had transformed matter, as the receptacle of evil, into the divine soul of the world, where it continued to operate as the source of all evil. God is a transcendent being, which operates through divine intermediaries, which are the gods and daemons of popular religion. Numenius of Apamea (c. 160) combined Platonism with Neopythagoreanism and other eastern philosophies, in a move which would prefigure the development of Neoplatonism. - Dio of Alexandria ( Greek : ) was an Academic philosopher and a friend of Antiochus of Ascalon who lived in the 1st century BC. He was sent by his fellow - citizens as ambassador to Rome , to complain about the conduct of their king , Ptolemy XII Auletes . On his arrival at Rome he was poisoned by the king 's secret agents , and the strongest suspicion of the murder fell upon Marcus Caelius . - Academic skepticism refers to the skeptical period of ancient Platonism dating from around 266 BC, when Arcesilaus became head of the Platonic Academy, until around 90 BC, when Antiochus of Ascalon rejected skepticism. Unlike the existing school of skepticism, the Pyrrhonists, they maintained that knowledge of things is impossible. Ideas or notions are never true; nevertheless, there are degrees of probability, and hence degrees of belief, which allow one to act. The school was characterized by its attacks on the Stoics and on their belief in convincing impressions which lead to true knowledge. The most important Academic skeptics were Arcesilaus, Carneades, and Philo of Larissa. - Marcus Tullius Cicero ( \\"Kikern\\"; 3 January 106 BC 7 December 43 BC) was a Roman philosopher, politician, lawyer, orator, political theorist, consul, and constitutionalist. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. - Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 125 c. 68 BC) was an Academic philosopher. He was a pupil of Philo of Larissa at the Academy, but he diverged from the Academic skepticism of Philo and his predecessors. He was a teacher of Cicero, and the first of a new breed of eclectics among the Platonists; he endeavoured to bring the doctrines of the Stoics and the Peripatetics into Platonism, and stated, in opposition to Philo, that the mind could distinguish true from false. In doing so, he claimed to be reviving the doctrines of the Old Academy. With him began the phase of philosophy known as Middle Platonism. - Platonism, rendered as a proper noun, is the philosophy of Plato or the name of other philosophical systems considered closely derived from it. In narrower usage, platonism, rendered as a common noun (with a lower case \\"p\\" subject to sentence case), refers to the philosophy that affirms the existence of abstract objects, which are asserted to \\"exist\\" in a \\"third realm\\" distinct both from the sensible external world and from the internal world of consciousness, and is the opposite of nominalism. Lower case \\"platonists\\" need not accept any of the doctrines of Plato.

And the answer is?","completion":"The Mazda Cosmo, which first hit the market in 1990, was the first car to be equipped with an optional GPS-based car navigation system. This groundbreaking technology represented a major advancement in the automotive industry and laid the groundwork for future developments in vehicle connectivity and convenience. The specific navigation system offered in the Mazda Cosmo was known as the Electronic Navigation System, or simply Eunos Nav. It used a 6-inch color LCD screen and was mounted in the center console, easily accessible by the driver. The GPS technology of that time relied on a combination of receivers placed on the car and a network of satellites in space to collect real-time data, which was then interpreted by the on-board system to provide location information and driving directions. The original system, while revolutionary for the time, had its limitations. It required the use of often-expensive memory cards that contained specialized digital map software for each specific region in which the vehicle would be traveling. Additionally, the route guidance was primarily provided through on-screen graphics with limited voice instructions, and up-to-date traffic information was mostly unavailable at that time. Despite its shortcomings compared to today's modern GPS systems with real-time traffic updates and more advanced features, the introduction of the Eunos Nav in the Mazda Cosmo was a major milestone in automotive history. It demonstrated the growing importance of incorporating digital technology into vehicles and paved the way for future innovations in GPS navigation, driver convenience, and vehicle connectivity. Over the following years, GPS navigation systems have rapidly evolved and become much more sophisticated and practical. Today, GPS navigation has become an essential feature in many vehicles, with manufacturers increasingly integrating these systems into their designs as standard features. Moreover, connectivity with smartphones has further improved navigation technology, allowing for real-time traffic updates, enhanced route guidance, and a plethora of additional location-based services. The Mazda Cosmo's introduction of the first GPS-based car navigation system as an option signaled a significant shift in the automotive industry, bringing together technology and convenience to create a more connected, efficient, and enjoyable driving experience for consumers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Solve -7*u + 16 = 30 for u.","completion":"To solve the equation -7*u + 16 = 30 for the variable u, we need to perform a series of steps using the basic algebraic operations. Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable. In this example, we want to isolate the term -7*u, which means that we have to move the constant term on the left-hand side, which is 16, to the other side. To do that, we will subtract 16 from both sides of the equation: -7*u + 16 - 16 = 30 - 16 This simplifies to: -7*u = 14 Step 2: Solve for the variable u. Now that we have isolated the term with the variable -7*u, we need to obtain the value of u. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -7, as this is the coefficient of u: (-7*u) / -7 = 14 / -7 The -7 in the numerator (the coefficient of u) and the -7 in the denominator cancel each other out, and we get: u = -2 So, the solution to the equation -7*u + 16 = 30 is u = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records. Question: \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11\\" Response: \\"Aircraft speed\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

A:","completion":"To answer this elaborate question, we must first look at the biographical information of each of these composers, Charles Gounod and Mikhail Glinka, and assess their lifespans in relation to the year 1875. Charles Gounod (1818-1893): Charles-François Gounod was a French composer, best known for his Ave Maria (based on a work by Johann Sebastian Bach), as well as his operas Faust and Roméo et Juliette. Born on June 17, 1818, in Paris, France, Gounod's career spanned a significant portion of the 19th century. He began composing at a young age and studied under distinguished teachers, such as Pierre Zimmermann and Antoine Reicha at the Paris Conservatoire. Throughout his life, Gounod's compositions encompassed various musical forms, including sacred music, symphonies, and secular works. With respect to the question at hand, Charles Gounod lived past the year 1875. He continued to compose and conduct music up until his final years. Gounod died at the age of 75 on October 17, 1893, in Saint-Cloud, France. Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857): Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka was a Russian composer, hailed as the father of Russian classical music. He was born on June 1, 1804, in Novospasskoye, Russia. Glinka created compositions that showcased Russia's rich folk and cultural heritage, thus inspiring other Russian composers such as Mussorgsky, Borodin, and Rimsky-Korsakov. Among his most famous works are the operas A Life for the Tsar (Ivan Susanin) and Ruslan and Lyudmila, as well as orchestral works like Kamarinskaya and the overture to Ruslan and Lyudmila. Unfortunately, Mikhail Glinka did not live past the year 1875. After a distinguished career marked by both success and personal hardship, Glinka passed away at the age of 52 on February 15, 1857, in Berlin, Germany. In conclusion, between the two composers, only Charles Gounod lived past the year 1875, while Mikhail Glinka passed away almost two decades prior. Both musicians, however, left behind an enduring legacy that shaped the development of European classical music, reflecting the distinct characteristics of their respective countries and cultures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. and a hint : In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Please answer this question : Which town had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions?

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity? The extensive grazing in Tibet lead to carbon and nitrogen loss, subject to desertification, while Nepal adopted a different approach to food production, putting nature and biodiversity first. Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","completion":"Answer: Nepal experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity.

This perturbation can affect the blood entering the kidney indirectly. To justify this answer, let's break down the process step-by-step: 1. Blood enters the kidney - If the kidneys are working very well, they will effectively and efficiently filter the blood. 2. The blood travels into the nephrons - The good performance of the kidneys may help the nephrons work more efficiently as the blood flows through them. 3. Waste is expelled via the nephrons - A well-functioning kidney will expel waste more effectively through the nephrons. 4. The waste goes to the bladder in the form of urine - The kidneys working well will result in proper urine formation and transfer to the bladder. 5. The clean blood exits the kidneys - With the kidneys working properly, the clean blood will exit the kidneys and return to circulation.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON — For more than 30 years, Concepcion Picciotto has held vigil outside the White House, protesting nuclear weapons and calling for peace. But Thursday morning, it appeared that her decades-long protest was finally over. U.S. Park Police removed her encampment — a tarp-covered umbrella and enormous hand-painted signs with messages like \\"Ban all nuclear weapons or have a nice doomsday\\" — before restoring it in the afternoon. Picciotto, a tiny and weather-worn 77-year-old, has maintained a steady presence in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House, since 1981 — \\"in the snow, in the cold, in the heat,\\" she said. She came to the United States from Spain in 1960 and worked for a while in the Spanish consulate in New York. In 1979, she made her way to Washington seeking help with a custody battle and eventually joined with fellow protester William Thomas to form the White House vigil. Thomas died in 2009. In recent years, activists from the Occupy movement have assisted Picciotto in maintaining her protest. The encampment was taken down by police early Thursday after the man who was standing watch abandoned it, according to the National Park Service. “While a 24-hour vigil site generally does not require a permit, it must be continuously attended,” the Park Service said in a statement. “With no one attending the site, the officer collected the materials and placed them in a U.S. Park Police storage facility for safe keeping until they could be retrieved by the owner.” The man was a combat veteran who stepped away because he was having an episode of post-traumatic stress, said Feriha Kaya, who helps coordinate the volunteer shifts through a group called the Peace House DC. Picciotto said she was frustrated and upset to hear that the encampment had been removed. “I feel the world is coming down,” she said. With discussions of military action in Syria, she added, “now more than ever we need to communicate to people the danger of the nuclear bomb.” She immediately sprang into action, calling on fellow activists for help. Her requests quickly reached the office of Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the Washington, D.C., delegate to the House of Representatives, who has known Picciotto since 1993 and has introduced nuclear disarmament bills to Congress for years. Following a call from Norton’s staff, the Park Police agreed to return the encampment. In a statement, Norton said Picciotto was “well known for her willingness to engage in principled activism at considerable personal costs. She and her friends and allies have abided by the rules, and this single mishap by a fellow activist should not torpedo her longstanding vigil.” By noon, Picciotto was back in Lafayette Square, awaiting her belongings. There had been close calls with losing the encampment in the past. Picciotto said she used to get in regular scuffles with the police. About a decade ago, she left her post for 45 minutes and they had brought in a truck to remove the vigil by the time she got back. But she wouldn’t even consider that police might not return the encampment. “They have to,” Picciotto said. “I will be there.” She pointed to the spot on the ground where three fellow activists sat waiting. At 2:30 p.m., supporters finally arrived with broken umbrella and intact signs in tow, hauled from storage by the Park Police. With a crew of helpers and a crowd watching, Picciotto began reassembling the pieces, stopping occasionally to take pictures with well-wishers and smile her mostly toothless smile. “I am satisfied,” she said. “I want to keep communicating to people that there should be no more war.” Follow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook alexei.koseff@latimes.com ||||| Connie Picciotto, right, and fellow activist Feriha Kaya reassemble her peace vigil tent, which was taken down by authorities when it was mistakenly left vacant Thursday in Washington. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) Just hours after a renowned peace vigil across from the White House was dismantled by U.S. Park Police, it was resurrected in Lafayette Square on Thursday afternoon. A crowd watched as a handful of young activists wheeled the reclaimed planks of wood, cinder blocks and hand-lettered signs back to the place along Pennsylvania Avenue where the protest has stood for more than 30 years. “It’s coming, it’s coming!” one activist cried as the vigil materials made their way down the red brick sidewalks through the park. “Thirty-two years, still going!” On Thursday morning, Washington residents passing through Lafayette Square noticed a startling absence — the landmark white plastic shelter, framed by large wooden anti-nuclear signs, was no longer stationed across the street from the White House. Also missing was Concepcion Picciotto, the legendary protester who has served as the vigil’s longest-running caretaker. Picciotto, 77, and her fellow protesters said that the vigil was taken down by Park Police in the early morning hours after an activist who was supposed to be manning a shift at the site walked away. Park Police spokesman Paul Brooks confirmed that the vigil was taken down by police in the early morning hours after it was left unattended — a violation of National Park Service rules. The peace vigil that was planted outside the White House for more than 30 years was dismantled then rebuilt Thursday. The Post’s Zoeann Murphy caught up with longtime-protester Concepcion Picciotto as she waited for her signs to be returned. (The Washington Post) The resulting outcry was immediate. Residents of Peace House, a home in Northwest Washington where Picciotto and the other activists who tend the vigil reside, spread the word among supporters and contacted local social service organizations for help. Tighe Barry, a community organizer for Code Pink, a social justice organization, said he called the office of D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) on Thursday morning after learning what had happened. Norton’s staff contacted Park Police and helped arrange for Picciotto’s vigil materials to be returned, according to a statement released by Norton’s office. “I appreciate that the Park Police have worked with us to defuse a growing controversy about the removal of Concepcion Picciotto’s belongings,” Norton said in the statement. “She is well known for her willingness to engage in principled activism at considerable personal costs. She and her friends and allies have abided by the rules, and this single mishap by a fellow activist should not torpedo her long-standing vigil.” Park Police said in a statement the vigil “was abandoned early Thursday morning” and that under the law, “a 24-hour vigil requires no permit but must be continuously occupied.” The statement went on to say that “once it was determined that the site was abandoned, the officer collected the materials and placed them in a U.S. Park Police storage facility for safe keeping until they could be retrieved by the owner.” The vigil has been a fixture along Pennsylvania Avenue since 1981, when Picciotto first joined the vigil’s founder, William Thomas, on the sidewalk outside the White House. Over the decades that followed, Picciotto and Thomas — a self-described philosopher and activist who died in January 2009 — protested war after war, endured blizzards and heat waves, and gradually became a storied part of the city’s history. The future of the vigil has been in doubt in recent years. Picciotto has grappled with health problems, and the Peace House where she lives is at risk of being sold if the resident activists can’t afford to purchase the property. Thursday’s incident was hardly the first time that the vigil’s presence has been threatened by authorities. But other similar encounters — including the removal of the vigil and the arrest of its caretakers — occurred years ago, when Thomas was still alive. Picciotto said that the man who was covering the vigil overnight left sometime during the early morning and returned to the Peace House. Feriha Kaya, who manages Peace House, said the man is a veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. By the time other activists got to the park, Picciotto said, the signs and the vigil shelter were gone. Shortly before 1 p.m. Thursday, two Park Police officers approached the activists gathered in the park and told Barry that he could retrieve the vigil materials on Picciotto’s behalf. “I am relieved,” Picciotto said when she learned the news. “My signs are coming back.” They were in her possession again less than two hours later. Picciotto said there was never any question in her mind about whether her work in the park would continue. “It is needed now more than ever,” she said. “Look at the situation with Syria.” Picciotto said she was frustrated by the hassle, but it would only be another road bump in the long history of a record-holding act of protest. “This is just so much trouble for nothing,” she said. “It’s frustrating. It’s hard to be there. I’m in the heat, I’m in the cold, I’m in the snow.” Picciotto has acknowledged that the long-term future of the vigil is anything but certain. But by midday Thursday, the sidewalk across the street from the White House was once again home to its iconic installation, and the vigil’s dedicated caretaker had solemnly resumed her work. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A lady named Concepcion Picciotto has been standing outside the White House for many years, protesting against nuclear weapons and asking for peace. She uses signs with big letters to share her message. One day, the police took her signs and umbrella away because she wasn't there to watch them. But, with the help of her friends and a kind person named Eleanor Holmes Norton, she got her things back and set them up again. Concepcion is very determined to keep asking for peace and no more wars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Thinking of Good Vibrations We are only thinking cheerful thoughts today, people. America did good. Enjoy. Even if you voted for John McCain, be happy. You’ve got the best of all worlds. Today, you can bask in the realization that there are billions of people around the planet who loathed our country last week but are now in awe of its capacity to rise above historic fears and prejudices, that once again, the United States will have a president the world wants to follow. Then later, when things get screwed up, you can point out that it’s not your fault. About the inevitable disasters: I am sorry to tell you, excited youth of America, that Barack Obama is going to make mistakes. And the country’s broke. Perhaps we should have mentioned this before. But let’s leave all that to 2009. When somebody runs one of the best presidential campaigns ever, he deserves a little time to enjoy the sweet spot between achievement of a goal and the arrival of the consequences. Let’s hear it for the voters. Good turnout, guys  especially you Virginians who stood in line for seven hours. A professor at George Mason University who studies this sort of thing claims that there hasn’t been such a high participation level since 1908. You could turn out to be the ever-elusive answer to the question: “Name one thing that Barack Obama has in common with William Howard Taft?” Let’s hear it for Hillary Clinton, who lost but made the country comfortable with the idea of a woman as chief executive. And Joe Biden, who actually ran a disciplined campaign, given his truly exceptional capacity to say weird things. And let’s give a shout-out to John McCain. As desperate as he was, he still passed up opportunities to poke hard at the nation’s fault lines of race, religion and region  although he has probably created a permanent gap between the rest of us and segments of the country who feel under imminent threat from Bill Ayers. McCain ran a dreadful campaign, but it’s over. Give the guy a break. He was stuck with George Bush. And the Republican Party. And the fact that he was constitutionally incapable of giving a decent speech. The road was hard, but he soldiered on and did a lovely concession Tuesday night. Kudos. Sarah Palin did go over the top with her small towns vs. the world mantra. However, she does get credit for giving us a real understanding of the difference between a moose and a caribou. O.K., there is nothing positive to say about Sarah Palin. And Alaska, are you re-electing Ted Stevens? What’s going on there? Did you actually believe him when he said that the court verdict was still up in the air? On the day after he was found guilty? By the way, if Stevens does win, it will be with about 106,000 votes. In total. There are more people than that in my immediate neighborhood! What kind of state is this, anyway? But we’re in a good mood, so let’s forget Alaska. Instead, we’ll contemplate the fact that North Carolina tossed Elizabeth Dole out of office despite her ad campaign aimed at convincing the state that her opponent, Kay Hagan, was an atheist. This was accomplished, you may remember, through the creative strategy of showing Hagan’s picture along with another woman’s voice saying: “There is no God!” If Dole had won, by the next election we would have been bombarded with ads that appeared to show candidates saying “I support adultery!” or “Let’s kill the puppies!” Now that won’t happen. Thank you, North Carolina. By the way, I believe that during the campaign McCain’s great friend Senator Lindsey Graham said something along the line of promising to drown himself if North Carolina went for Obama. I believe I speak for us all, Senator Graham, when I say that we are feeling extremely mellow today and you do not have to follow through. Congratulations to Senator Susan Collins on her re-election. The entire moderate Republican caucus in the Senate may now wind up consisting of women from Maine. As Maine goes, so go the Supreme Court nominations. Finally, on behalf of the baby-boom generation, I would like to hear a little round of applause before we cede the stage to the people who were too young to go to Woodstock and would appreciate not having to listen to the stories about it anymore. It looks as though we will be represented in history by only two presidents, one of whom is George W. Bush. Bummer. The boomers didn’t win any wars and that business about being self-involved was not entirely unfounded. On the other hand, they made the nation get serious about the idea of everybody being created equal. And now American children are going to grow up unaware that there’s anything novel in an African-American president or a woman running for the White House.

When Russ asked him to play guitar in the new band , Aaron agreed . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"These two sentences may appear to be paraphrases of each other at first glance, as they both involve Aaron and Russ agreeing to play guitar in a new band. However, there are subtle differences between the two that suggest they are, in fact, not exact paraphrases but rather distinct sentences with slightly different implications. In the first sentence: \\"When Aaron asked him to play guitar in the band 's new band, Russ agreed.\\" This sentence indicates that Aaron asked Russ to play guitar in a new band, which is a project associated with their current band, as indicated by the possessive \\"the band's new band\\". It implies that there is already an existing band in which Aaron and Russ are involved, and now they are starting or participating in an additional project within the context of that original band. Russ agrees to be part of this new project. In the second sentence: \\"When Russ asked him to play guitar in the new band, Aaron agreed.\\" This sentence indicates that Russ is the one who asked Aaron to play guitar in a new band. The phrase \\"the new band\\" implies a completely new and independent project that is separate from any existing band they may be associated with. In this case, Aaron agrees to join and play guitar in this new band. To summarize, the main differences between the two sentences are as follows: 1. The initiator of the proposal to play guitar in the new band is different in each sentence. In the first sentence, Aaron invites Russ, while in the second sentence, Russ invites Aaron. 2. The relationship between the new band and any existing band is different. The first sentence implies that the new band is associated with a current band they are part of, while the second sentence suggests an entirely new and unrelated project. Thus, while the sentences convey similar ideas of Aaron and Russ agreeing to play guitar in a new band, they are not exact paraphrases due to these subtle differences in who is proposing the idea and the context of the new band in relation to their existing musical involvement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Euroopan komission keskeisenä tehtävänä on varmistaa, että Euroopan unionin politiikat ja lainsäädäntö pannaan täytäntöön tehokkaasti ja johdonmukaisesti sen 27 jäsenmaassa. Komissio valmistelee ehdotuksia unionin lainsäädännöksi ja uusiksi politiikoiksi, ja se vastaa niiden täytäntöönpanosta, kun ne on hyväksytty Euroopan parlamentissa ja neuvostossa. Komissio on myös jäsenmaiden, yritysten ja kansalaisten tärkeä yhteystaho unionin asioissa. On normaalia, että Euroopan komissio muuttaa kantojaan eri asioissa.

As they dig deeper into the town's past, Amelia and Tom uncover an ancient relic in the form of a large crystal — the First Power. The relic dates back to the time of the founding of the Novum by a secret order called \\"The Vigil.\\". Worshipped by its founders, the First Power possesses the ability to resurrect the dead. As more and more people are brought back to life, the town descends into chaos. Some townspeople are overjoyed to reunite with their deceased loved ones, while others are terrified by the unnatural phenomena. It becomes clear that the resurrection of the dead comes with a steep price. With each resurrection, the First Power slowly begins to weaken the barrier between the world of the living and the spirit realm, inadvertently allowing vengeful spirits and dangerous creatures to cross over. Amelia uncovers a diary written by her ancestor, who was a member of The Vigil, revealing that the first power must be carefully controlled, and boundaries must be maintained to prevent an irreversible collapse of the barrier. The diary also alludes to a counter-relic, known as the \\"Second Power,\\" capable of restoring the balance between the two realms. As the situation escalates, Amelia and Tom embark on a race against time to locate the Second Power and prevent the irreversible collapse of the barrier. During their quest, they must face off against the malevolent spirits, who are trying to manipulate the crystal for their own sinister intentions. In the climactic final battle, Amelia and Tom manage to overpower the spirits and combine the First and Second Powers.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"We must learn now that it is much worse to bear the burdens resulting from bank debts. The given text is written in Romanian, and when translated to English, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the severity of bearing the burdens and consequences that arise from having bank debts. This statement could be related to the financial challenges that many people face and the need to raise awareness about handling and managing debt responsibly. Debts, if left unchecked, could lead to severe financial instability, which might have a negative impact on the overall well-being of an individual or an organization. Bank debts refer to the money borrowed from banks, which could be personal loans, mortgages, automobile loans, credit card debts, or other types of loans and credit lines. Incurring bank debts is often inevitable for many people during various stages of life as they seek funds for expenses such as education, housing, or business ventures. However, managing and paying off these debts is essential to avoid potential long-term financial problems. Failure to properly address bank debts can lead to various consequences, depending on the type of debt. Some of the consequences include: 1. Increased debt amount: When a person fails to make regular payments for the debt they owe, interest rates and late fees can accumulate over time, increasing the overall debt amount. 2. Damaged credit score: A person's credit score may suffer if they default on their loan payments. This could make it difficult for them to secure loans or credit lines in the future. 3. Legal actions: Banks could take legal actions against individuals who repeatedly fail to pay their debts. Depending on the severity of the case, legal actions might include wage garnishments, repossession of property, or even foreclosure. 4. Emotional stress: Constantly dealing with debt can lead to extreme emotional stress and negatively affect a person's mental health. To avoid these potential consequences, it is crucial to take steps towards responsible debt management: 1. Create a budget: It is essential to develop a budget that outlines income, expenses, and allowances for debt repayment. 2. Prioritize debts: Analyzing and prioritizing debts according to their interest rates or importance could help with efficient debt repayment. 3. Seek assistance: If managing debts becomes overwhelming, an individual can seek assistance from professionals or organizations that offer credit counseling or debt consolidation. 4. Establish an emergency fund: Having a financial safety net can help avoid taking on more debt during unplanned expenses or emergencies. 5. Develop a long-term financial plan: Plan for better financial management in the future by setting realistic saving and spending goals and pursuing debt-free living. In conclusion, understanding the burden of bank debts and its consequences is crucial for individual financial stability. It is important to raise awareness about responsible debt management and offer support for those in need of addressing their financial obligations. By being proactive and addressing debts, individuals can strive for a more secure and stable financial future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

In particular, it can help you if you: Belong to a company that is not well known Can't always find the right person at a large company to sell to Are looking for leads for big ticket items Are selling to companies where nobody picks up a phone any more LinkedIn selling is somewhat limited if you are selling to individuals. LinkedIn is great for finding leads. But if you are already in contact with the right people at prospect companies, it won't be very helpful. The Premium accounts will help you find the right buyers and contact them. When you search with a Premium account, you will be able to read the full name of the people you find in search. Premium account holders can also send a limited number of \\"LinkedIn InMails\\" directly to the sales prospects they find. They are \\"guaranteed opened,\\" meaning, if the person you are trying to contact does not open the message in seven days, your credit is refunded and you get to try with someone else. Sales accounts cost USD a few hundred to USD1000 per year. LinkedIn search is pretty user friendly, but it still takes a bit of practice to get the right people to come back on the search. You probably already know who the economic buyers for your product are, but you may not know what their job titles are. For example, if you want to set up meetings with materials managers of food manufacturing companies, you simply set your search filter to show you people in food manufacturing with title material manager. You may need to specify additional keywords to get the exact list of people you are looking for. InMails are messages sent via LinkedIn to the prospect you want to contact. Consider hand crafting the message to the prospect. LinkedIn only gives you a limited number of InMails, and charges you for them, so you want to make each one count. LinkedIn fits the VITO letter model a lot more than the smile and dial model. Remember that putting in a personal note referencing your connection to the prospect increases your success dramatically. Since you only have a limited number of InMails, you may want to use other ways of contacting prospects that you can find without LinkedIn. You can try: Guessing their email address. Using a lead database. Phone call Facebook messages. Facebook also charges for premium emails, but sometimes it is pretty cheap. LinkedIn lets you see the contacts of your contacts, some of which could be sales prospects. Make a list of your happy/reference customers who might introduce you to their friends. Add these customers as connections on LinkedIn. Browse your customers' connections. You will find some connections that could also be sales prospects for you. You can approach these new prospects in several ways. You can hit them with an InMail, do a LinkedIn introduction request (which does not count against your InMail quota), contact them offline, or ask your customer for an introduction. Note that adding your customers as your connections can have risks. A clever competitor sales rep might be able to see who you are connected to unless you set your privacy correctly. You can avoid this by hiding your connections.

In general, the elements that combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetals. This contrasts with ionic compounds, which usually involve bonds between metal ions and nonmetal ions. Because ionic charges cannot be used to name these compounds or to write their formulas, a different naming system must be used for molecular compounds. Another difference between ionic and molecular compounds is that two nonmetal atoms will frequently combine with one another in a variety of ratios.

Does \\"The direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"When was direct integral introduced by von Neumann?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann\\" contains the correct answer to the question \\"When was direct integral introduced by von Neumann?\\" The direct integral was introduced in the year 1949 by the mathematician John von Neumann. To provide you with more context about John von Neumann and the direct integral, here is a more detailed and long answer: John von Neumann (1903-1957) was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and polymath. He made significant contributions to several fields, including quantum mechanics, game theory, computer science, and functional analysis. One of his notable achievements in the field of functional analysis is the development of the direct integral. The direct integral is a mathematical concept that generalizes the notion of an integral, which is a way of combining an infinite number of terms into a single value. It deals with the integration of functions from a parameterized family of Hilbert spaces. This concept is essential in the study of group representations, quantum mechanics, and operator algebras. In 1949, John von Neumann formalized the direct integral and introduced it as a powerful tool for unifying and simplifying various concepts in the mathematical analysis of physical systems. To understand the motivation behind the direct integral, consider the classical concept of the integral (or Lebesgue integral) in mathematics. The integral can be seen as a continuous sum of values of a function over an interval, a way to aggregate these values to obtain a meaningful result representing the area under the curve of the function. The direct integral extends this idea to situations where the domain of integration is not a simple interval, but rather involves a family of Hilbert spaces indexed by a parameter. In practical terms, the direct integral is often used to decompose a given representation of a group into a direct sum (or integral) of simpler, irreducible representations. This is particularly useful in quantum mechanics, where it helps to describe the behavior of quantum systems in terms of different energy levels and the corresponding wave functions. Moreover, the direct integral also helps analyze the structure of operator algebras, which are objects that naturally appear in the study of linear operators on Hilbert spaces. In conclusion, the statement you provided contains the correct answer to the question regarding the introduction of the direct integral by John von Neumann. This groundbreaking mathematical concept was introduced in 1949 and continues to be essential in functional analysis and various applications in the mathematical and physical sciences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Harvey chose the name Monte Ne, which supposedly combined the Spanish and Omaha...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Question: How long does Trump probably play golf without resting?

Question: Where could she go to find a big cat to see? Options: - front door - residence - zoo - restaurant - barn Explain why a human would choose \\"zoo\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human would choose \\"zoo\\" as the answer to the question above as it is the most suitable place among the options given to find and observe a big cat. The rationale behind this choice is based on multiple factors that make a zoo the most logical and appropriate place for such a purpose. Let's examine these factors below. 1. Zoos are known for housing a variety of wildlife and exotic animals, including big cats like lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. These animals are specifically brought to zoos for the purpose of study, conservation, and public education. In contrast, the other options - front door, residence, restaurant, and barn - are not appropriate places to find big cats due to various reasons: a. Front door - This refers to the entrance of a home or building, which is not a location where one would typically find a large wild cat. b. Residence - A human dwelling is not a suitable location for a big cat to reside due to the inherent dangers associated with keeping a wild animal in a domesticated environment. It is also illegal in many countries to keep big cats as pets. c. Restaurant - Restaurants are places where people go to eat and socialize, and they are neither meant nor equipped to house big cats. d. Barn - While a barn might be spacious enough to accommodate a big cat, it is primarily meant for housing domesticated farm animals like cows, horses, and pigs, and is not designed specifically for big cats or their well-being. 2. Zoos have specialized facilities that cater to the needs of big cats and their well-being. These facilities feature spacious enclosures designed to replicate the animals' natural habitats as closely as possible. Moreover, they are equipped with various enrichment activities to keep the animals physically and mentally stimulated. These aspects of a zoo environment contribute to the overall safety and welfare of big cats, making them the best place to find and observe them. 3. Zoos employ trained staff, including animal caretakers, veterinarians, and conservationists, who are knowledgeable about the needs and behavior of big cats. These professionals ensure that the animals are well taken care of and receive appropriate nutrition, medical care, and enrichment. This level of expertise and care is not possible at a front door, residence, restaurant, or barn. 4. Visiting a zoo gives people the opportunity to learn more about big cats and their conservation status in the wild. Zoos play a crucial role in raising public awareness about the importance of wildlife preservation and the threats facing these animals. This educational aspect is not present in the other options provided. 5. Zoos are regulated establishments that follow strict guidelines and adhere to governmental and industry standards, ensuring the welfare and ethical treatment of the animals housed there. On the other hand, front doors, residences, restaurants, and barns do not have any such mechanism to ensure the responsible handling, care, and management of big cats. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"zoo\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most suitable location among the given options for finding and observing a big cat. Zoos are designed to safely house, care for, and conserve these animals, while providing an opportunity for the public to learn about their significance and the need for their conservation in the wild. This combination of factors makes the zoo the most appropriate and logical choice for a person looking to see a big cat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"To thoroughly address the validity of the suggested answer, the initial question and the provided answer must be analyzed and evaluated in detail. Initial question: \\"What is topsoil used for?\\" Topsoil is the uppermost layer of soil, generally defined as the top 5 to 12 inches (12 to 30 cm) of soil. It is the portion of the soil that is richest in organic matter and nutrients, making it incredibly important for plant growth and overall health. Topsoil provides the necessary nutrient base, water retention, and aeration required for plants to thrive. It is used for various applications such as gardening, landscaping, agriculture, and land reclamation. Consequently, it is an essential resource for any plant-based cultivation. Suggested answer: “Topsoil, as well as farm fertilizers and other potential pollutants, run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur.” The suggested answer does not directly address the question about the uses of topsoil. Instead, it discusses a potential environmental concern related to topsoil, farm fertilizers, and heavy rains, commonly known as runoff. While the suggested answer holds some truth about the environmental issues that might occur with topsoil and farm fertilizers, it does not fulfill the original intent of the question. Therefore, an appropriate answer for the initial question could be: “Topsoil is used primarily for supporting plant growth by providing a rich source of nutrients, organic matter, and a suitable medium for strong root development. Its applications can be found in gardening, landscaping, agriculture, and land reclamation projects, where plants and vegetation play a crucial role.” Based on the above information, the suggested answer should not be validated, as it deviates from the primary focus of the question.

Write an article with the title: \\"Osama bin Laden was killed with help of Pakistanis: report\\"","completion":"Title: Osama bin Laden was killed with help of Pakistanis: report Introduction The manhunt for the elusive mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden, lasted for almost a decade, until his killing in May 2011 by US Navy SEALS in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. While the success of the operation was hailed as a remarkable achievement by the United States, growing revelations suggest that the operation relied considerably on the assistance provided by the Pakistani intelligence and military officials. This article delves into the reported role of Pakistan in aiding the hunt for bin Laden and examines the reasons behind the country's involvement. Evidence of Pakistani involvement According to a recent revealing report, the killing of Osama bin Laden was made possible with the help of Pakistani intelligence officials who provided critical information to the United States. The following key points emerged in the report: 1. A senior Pakistani intelligence officer divulged the location of bin Laden's compound to the US in August 2010. The compound was situated less than a mile from Pakistan's eminent military academy, raising questions over the extent of local knowledge about bin Laden's presence. 2. Additionally, the report alleges that Pakistan played a cooperative role in facilitating the US Navy SEALs operation that culminated in the assassination of bin Laden. Specifically, the elite SEAL Team 6 was able to conduct reconnaissance, undeterred, near the compound and gather intelligence on the target. 3. Moreover, it is suspected that high-level Pakistani military officers ordered a stand-down during the covert operation to allow the SEALs to reach the compound successfully. Claims abound that the order came from Pakistan's military chief at the time, General Ashfaq Kayani, or the head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, Lieutenant General Ahmad Shuja Pasha. Reasons for cooperation Given Pakistan's precarious relationship with the United States, the purported collaboration in eliminating bin Laden might appear unlikely. Nonetheless, the report elaborates on several probable motives for the country's ostensible cooperation: 1. Corruption and bribery: It was reported that the US had offered a 25 million bounty for information leading to bin Laden's capture or death. The Pakistani official who provided the critical tip-off may have been acting out of personal financial gain. 2. Strategic interests: Pakistan may have perceived the elimination of bin Laden as an opportunity to redeem their relationship with the United States and project their commitment as an ally in the war against terrorism. 3. Domestic security concerns: The Pakistani government has had to contend with the aftermath of terrorist attacks orchestrated by groups linked to al-Qaeda on its soil. The removal of bin Laden could be in line with their aim to curb extremist elements that pose a threat to the country's stability. Conclusion The report positing that Pakistan played a role in the assassination of Osama bin Laden might never be officially confirmed. However, the mounting evidence introduced raises questions about the extent of Pakistan's involvement in the operation, as well as its motives behind the apparent cooperation. While this information might never be fully disclosed, the operation's execution and success demonstrated the culmination of complex global intelligence and military efforts in the pursuit of the world's most wanted terrorist."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.

First, I analyze the provided question: \\"Whether it's puppies or people, offspring and parents usually share many of what?\\" The question is asking about the shared aspect between parents and their offspring. 2. Then, reading the paragraph, the key phrase that corresponds to the question is \\"offspring and parents usually share many traits.\\" Hence, it is clear that this is something that is commonly passed from parents to children, whether in the context of humans or animals. 3. Analyzing the given choices: 'clothes', 'insects', 'fruits', and 'traits', it's clear that 'traits' is the correct answer. This is because traits are linked to genetics, therefore it's possible for traits to be passed down from a parent to their offspring. This fits the context and the information given in the paragraph, while the other three options have no such connection. 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. It would make science more important at the highest levels of government, says Sir Paul, a Nobel laureate. But he admits that what he is proposing could be seen as \\"a deal with the devil\\". The government spends more than Â£3bn each year on scientific research. This is allocated by seven specialist research councils, which spend on what they regard as the highest quality research without any government interference. These range from developing new medicines, hunting for new sub-atomic particles and assessing the impact human activities are having on the environment. It is a system that has led to the UK being one of the best countries in the world in many areas of research. But Sir Paul believes it could be better managed if the seven research councils were run by an umbrella body called Research UK. The aim would be to reduce bureaucracy, increase coordination and develop an overarching strategy for scientific research. Controversially, Sir Paul believes Research UK should have input from a committee of government ministers. Critics fear that this might lead to political interference in funding science and the loss of grants for areas of research that may seem obscure now - but could turn out to be scientifically important in the future. Sir Paul, however, believes that reform is needed to \\"put science at the heart of government\\". Under the current system, the government decides how much to spend on scientific research. But the scientific community then determines how those funds are distributed. The so-called \\"Haldane principle\\" is that money should be spent on the best science and that decision should be determined by experts in the field. Sir Paul believes that should continue but a more nuanced approach is now required. The proportion of money each research council has received has remained more or less unchanged for decades. But in that time the areas of research that each research council funds, such as physics, biology, medicine, engineering and the environment, have changed dramatically. It may well be that research in each of these areas has accelerated equally and that it is right that the proportion of funding each receives should remain unchanged. But the point Sir Paul is making is that even if such an assessment has been made, no-one knows about it. There is a suspicion from outside that each separate area of the research community jealously guards the money that has been passed on to them for generations. Sir Paul's concept for Research UK is to create an umbrella body where such discussions can be had openly. But what about his idea of inviting in the politicians? He wants ministers with an interest in science to talk to officials at Research UK. In particular, Sir Paul seems to want the Chancellor to formalise his growing interest in scientific research by chairing the group of ministers. Is that asking for trouble? Is there not a danger that ministers will want money spent for new labs in marginal constituencies, pet projects, and funding taken away from areas that don't match current political priorities? Sir Paul believes they won't and that the scientific community can marshal persuasive arguments. \\"Politicians are very sensible people, particularly in this country,\\" he told me. \\"We absolutely have to talk to politicians. We, as scientists, cost a lot of money and we have to justify what we do. \\"We have to engage with politicians if we are to maintain the support for science which is for the public good and promotes the economy. \\"We have to have a proper political discussion - and I want to promote that interface.\\" Sir Paul is an extremely nice man. But is he in danger of thinking everyone else is as nice as him and takes the same collegiate, enlightened view as he does of the way the world works? One concern is that ministers and their mandarins simply don't understand science and that if they are given an inch they will take a mile. There might be pressure to cut funding for the search of obscure sub-atomic particles, for example in order to spend more on materials science which might have a greater benefit to the economy. Sir Paul believes that the research community will be able to stand up for itself. He is clear that he wants the seven research councils to remain as they are - but argues their relative budgets should be reviewed periodically. \\"What I am proposing strengthens the research base. To have a more joined-up research strategy. \\"So instead of seven individual research strategies we have a combined voice and a proper platform for a strategy. \\"I think a good interaction between politicians and scientists is not only good for the scientific endeavour but society.\\" The elephant in the room is next week's spending review. Science funding has been relatively protected by George Osborne. It has been frozen and ring-fenced since 2010 by a Chancellor who has become increasingly amenable to research. He has become convinced that it can be a useful tool for his plans to increase UK productivity. In order to maintain or possibly improve on the deal they struck five years ago the scientific community will have to give George Osborne something back. And a little more meddling by the Chancellor may be a price they may well be prepared to pay for a good settlement in the Comprehensive Spending Review.

However, some people worry that if politicians get involved in deciding how research money is spent, they might use it for their own interests, like building labs in certain areas or funding projects that match their political goals. Sir Paul believes that scientists can make a strong case for how the money should be used, and that having discussions between politicians and researchers would help make sure that science stays important in the government's decisions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A top federal regulator is considering a split with President Barack Obama over a controversial Internet policy, according to a new report, in what could set up a big fight between the White House and the Federal Communications Commission. The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources who were present, sounded a different note than Obama when addressing a room full of tech executives after the President made his statement Monday. “What you want is what everyone wants: an open Internet that doesn’t affect your business,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told executives from several major tech companies, including Google GOOG and Yahoo YHOO . “What I’ve got to figure out is how to split the baby.” Obama on Monday made his strongest statement yet in support of Net Neutrality, the principle that all content should be treated equally online.

The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. Which location most probably suffered land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? A:","completion":"Location B most probably suffered land loss or similar processes. The key difference between location A and location B lies in the permanency of biodiversity loss. Location A's loss of biodiversity is described as temporary, indicating that recovery is possible through ecological restoration or resilience. This suggests that although there might be some environmental degradation, the situation may improve over time if appropriate measures are taken. On the other hand, location B's loss of biodiversity is referred to as permanent. This permanency implies that the environmental degradation that has occurred is irreversible. Land loss or similar processes often lead to outcomes that cannot be easily reversed, as once habitats are destroyed or significantly altered, the conditions necessary for the native species to survive and thrive are then compromised. The resulting decline in biodiversity is much more challenging to address compared to temporary loss. Based on this information, it is more likely that location B has suffered from land loss or comparable processes that have led to irreversible consequences for the local ecosystem and, consequently, created permanent biodiversity loss. Location C's loss of biodiversity has yet to be determined, and thus, it is not possible to conclude whether land loss or similar processes have occurred there without more context. As for location D (the entire globe), it's important to remember that local biodiversity losses contribute to the overall global loss. So, solving the issue in specific locations like A, B, and C will eventually help address the global challenges associated with biodiversity loss."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Context: Riley dipped Austin's head into a pool as they were having fun with friends.

Q: Abstract: The results of a survey of 769 patients attending the St. James's University Fertility Control Clinic, England, for abortion services showed that patients seeing general practitioners were less knowledgeable than those attending specialist clinics. There was a demonstrated need for counseling on pill and condom use and protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Knowledge of postcoital methods was also found to be lacking. The survey was conducted between April 1, 1991, and January 31, 1992. Respondents included minorities such as Afro-Caribbean (8%) and Asian (9%). 307 of the cases were using a less effective form of contraception at the time of conception, usually a change from the pill to condoms. Of the 171 people reporting failure of contraception, 93 noted a split or leaking condom; 13, a condom falling off during intercourse; 32, inconsistent use of condoms;l 32, forgetting to take contraceptive pills or using antibiotics with the pill; and 1, a late injection of medroxyprogesterone acetate. 45 of the 309 people who had conceived while using condoms recognized a potential condom failure, and only 20 attempted any emergency contraceptive method such as the postcoital pill. Only 30% of the 171 patients with recognized condom failure and 12% of the 210 who had not used any contraception had adequate knowledge of the existence, timing, and source of postcoital pills; i.e., 20% of 381. Only 2% of the 171 nd 2% of the 381 patients, had knowledge of postcoital insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Given the choice between and unplanned pregnancy and postcoital contraceptive, most (718 out of 769) preferred using postcoital contraception. Contraceptive information was given to 501 by a general practitioner, to 102 by a community family planning clinic, and 163 had no medical advice. There was a range of knowledge of postcoital contraceptive methods. Knowledge of how to deal with forgotten pills, severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, and concurrent antibiotic treatment among the 422 patients who had ever used the combined pill also was variable. 19% of the 372 patients treated by general practitioners knew 4 correct answers, but 50% of the 50 patients in community family planning clinics answered correctly 4 times.

Write an article based on this summary: Extra police officers will be patrolling the Lancaster to Barrow late-night weekend service after an increase in drunken behaviour. Article:","completion":"Title: Extra Police Officers Deployed to Lancaster-Barrow Late-Night Weekend Service Amid Surge in Drunken Behaviour Introduction In an effort to combat the escalated drunken behaviour on the Lancaster-Barrow late-night weekend service, additional police officers have been assigned to patrol these trains. These precautionary measures have been implemented to ensure public transport remains safe and accessible for all passengers, following a rise in alcohol-related incidents. Background The Lancaster-Barrow route is a popular choice for people travelling between these two cities, especially on weekends. However, it has experienced a significant increase in incidents involving intoxicated passengers in recent months. These episodes have ranged from causing public nuisance to physical assaults and distress to other passengers, ultimately leading to serious concerns about the safety of those who rely on this service. Efforts to Control Drunken Behaviour In response to the increase in alcohol-related disruptions, authorities have decided to deploy extra police officers to patrol the late-night weekend services operating along the Lancaster-Barrow line. These officers will ensure that the rules and regulations are strictly followed, while also providing additional safety and peace of mind for passengers travelling during these busy times. Their tasks will include inspecting tickets and ensuring passengers are not bringing excessive amounts of alcohol onto the trains. This will help reduce the chances of drunken incidents occurring in the first place while ensuring passengers cooperate with the rules. The officers will also be responsible for enforcing the alcohol ban on board and addressing any incidents that may arise as a result of intoxication. Impact on Passengers The deployment of these extra officers is expected to have a significant impact on passengers using the Lancaster-Barrow late-night weekend service. For most law-abiding passengers, the very presence of police officers will provide a sense of reassurance that their safety comes first. However, the additional police presence may deter those intent on making trouble from even boarding the trains, knowing there will be no tolerance for disorderly conduct. This will ultimately help create a more secure and relaxed environment, encouraging more people to travel by train during these hours. Furthermore, the increased police presence will lead to a quicker response time in dealing with incidents, reducing the likelihood of situations escalating and causing further harm or distress. Conclusion The deployment of extra police officers to patrol the Lancaster-Barrow late-night weekend service is a crucial step in addressing the growing problem of drunken behaviour on public transport. By having a more visible police presence, authorities aim to deter potential troublemakers, ensure train journeys remain safe for all passengers, and maintain a peaceful environment on board. It is hoped that the increased police presence will not only help reduce the number of alcohol-related incidents on the route but also promote a more responsible and mindful approach to alcohol consumption among travellers. This proactive measure taken by the authorities is a vital investment in increasing the safety and appeal of the local public transport system, making it more accessible and enjoyable for all who use it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the types of whales that use throat pleats to expand the mouth? Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that...

Possible answers: A. yes. B. it is not possible to tell. C. no.","completion":"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we should first break down the premise and hypothesis into their core statements and see if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Premise: Shopping never ends there's always another inviting spot just down the street. This means that there are always more shops ahead down the street, with each shop having something inviting or appealing for shoppers. Hypothesis: The shops all sell different things to entice buyers. This means that each shop has a unique variety of products that they sell in order to attract customers with different tastes and preferences. Now, we can analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise suggests that there are always more shops ahead with inviting features. While it does imply that these shops have some sort of appeal for buyers, it doesn't explicitly mention that they sell different things. Therefore, the answer is B. it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis.

What does that mean?","completion":"While both questions convey the idea of a friend providing advice or insight, they differ in the meaning and context of the phrases used. 1. \\"A friend recently told me, 'Don't have a thrombo'. What does this mean?\\" In this question, the friend appears to be using a slang term or colloquialism— \\"thrombo\\"—which is short for \\"thrombosis.\\" The term \\"thrombo\\" is used metaphorically in this context. It means that the speaker is advising the person not to get too worked up, agitated, or stressed. Hence, \\"Don't have a thrombo\\" essentially means \\"Don't get too stressed\\" or \\"Stay calm.\\" Here, the main focus of the question is on understanding this unique and colloquial phrase that the friend has used. Prior knowledge of the phrase's meaning, or an explanation from someone familiar with it, would be necessary to respond to the query effectively. 2. \\"My friend told me that I don't have clear concepts in life. What does that mean?\\" This question is based on a remark made by the speaker's friend, who believes that the person lacks clear concepts in life. The phrase \\"clear concepts\\" refers to well-defined principles or goals that guide an individual's actions, decisions, and overall approach to life. In this case, the friend is suggesting that the speaker may lack perspective, struggle with decision-making, or seem unsure of their beliefs or objectives. Unlike the first question, it doesn't require understanding specific slang or colloquialisms to comprehend, as the phrases used are more direct. In summary, while both questions revolve around understanding advice from a friend, they differ in the content and meaning of the phrases being analyzed. The first question deals with a colloquialism that must be deciphered, while the second question focuses on understanding the meaning behind a criticism or observation regarding clarity of purpose in life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching.

The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Compound B would have a lower melting point. Since compound B is a nonpolar compound, it requires less energy for the molecules to separate and move apart from one another than it would for the polar compound A. As a result, nonpolar compounds like compound B typically have lower melting and boiling points compared to polar compounds like compound A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, Stewart is hiding something that could tear his family and the entire town apart. Enter Charlotte Thompson, the 32-year-old sultry and charming art teacher at the local high school. While Stewart's wife is a dedicated career woman who has been focused on her family and climbing the corporate ladder, Charlotte offers him something entirely different: passion and excitement. The two begin a steamy affair, meeting in hidden corners of the town, stealing kisses and moments of passion in the secrecy of their hidden world. As the affair intensifies, Stewart becomes more reckless, with the occasional close call almost exposing their secret. However, they are both consumed by their desire for each other and cannot resist the pull of their forbidden love. Unbeknownst to them, someone in the town knows their secret and is quietly blackmailing Stewart to keep the knowledge from coming to light. Stewart pays the blackmailer but starts feeling the pressure. He confides in Charlotte about the blackmail and they start an investigation to find the person behind it. While trying to balance his marriage and the affair, Stewart is also consumed with guilt over what the exposure of their relationship would mean, especially for his daughter, Emily. Meanwhile, rumors and gossip are starting to spread throughout the town, creating tension and mistrust in the otherwise peaceful community. Leah Whiteley, Stewart's wife, starts picking up on the unusual behavior of her husband, which leads her to question the solidity of their marriage and pushing her to dig deeper. Charlotte discovers that Emily Whiteley is one of the most talented students in her art class, and she starts to bond with her, finding herself in a conflicting situation as she sees the pain Emily goes through due to her shaky family life. As Stewart and Charlotte get closer to uncovering the identity of the blackmailer, they learn that it's someone very close to both of them and never expected. The situation takes a drastic turn, with the blackmailer's real plan revealed, as it was not about money but to destroy the lives of everyone involved. Leah confronts Stewart about his affair upon finding evidence on her own and, heartbroken and devastated, she leaves him. Emily, having discovered the truth about her father and her art teacher, is equally crushed and loses her trust in both of them. The thrilling climax of the movie involves an intense confrontation with the blackmailer who has been pulling the strings all along, eventually leading to their downfall.

The first: he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. The second: he is partnered with detective Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), whom Tellis is aware of through reading the files on Calvess' death. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him.

Options: - wave goodbye - rub their head - experience fear - watch television - spring into action Explain why a human would choose \\"wave goodbye\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"The answer \\"wave goodbye\\" is the most appropriate for the situation in question because it relates directly to the act of saying farewell, which usually entails some form of acknowledgment, often physical, from the other party. The action of waving is internationally recognized as a signal or gesture of departure. It’s a simple movement accessible to people of all ages, including children, and doesn't require verbal communication. On the other hand, the remaining options don't correspond as strongly to the situation. Rubbing their head, for example, is a gesture that could mean a number of things depending on the context, and doesn't directly correlate with the act of saying goodbye. It’s certainly not a common or universal response to someone departing. Experiencing fear is an emotion rather than a gesture. Although children could potentially experience fear when someone is leaving, perhaps due to separation anxiety or uncertainty about what will happen next, it’s not a guaranteed or even likely reaction, particularly not in a general context. Not to mention, fear is not a visible \\"gesture\\" that can be universally recognized. Watching television is an activity that would likely distract children from the act of someone saying farewell to them. It implies they are disengaged from the situation and, therefore, wouldn't be the expected response if someone is directly addressing them to say goodbye. As for springing into action, this phrase is more related to responding quickly to a situation that requires immediate attention. It doesn’t fit well with the scene of saying farewell unless the children were expected to complete a task or action as soon as the individual saying goodbye departs. Therefore, a human would logically choose \\"wave goodbye\\" as the children’s most likely reaction when someone says farewell to them. This is a customary and universal way of acknowledging that one has heard and understood that someone is leaving, and it maintains a positive, respectful connection between the parties involved. Moreover, waving goodbye is an easy motion for children to manage, making it a typical reaction for them."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary. His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing. The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church. As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man. At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw. But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road. As he did so he glanced back. A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it. He was now bending down, probably with the object of concealing his identity, and had moved on a few paces farther down the road. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Gifford\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who was Gervase Henshaw concealing his identity from?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Gifford\\" correctly answers the question \\"Who was Gervase Henshaw concealing his identity from?\\" This is justified because, in the text, as Gifford crosses the stile and gains access to the road, he looks back and sees that Henshaw, who he previously identified, has moved a few paces down the road and is now bending down, presumably in an attempt to hide his identity, thus indicating that it is Gifford from whom Henshaw is hiding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of Missions in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. The most significant failure of Roman Catholic missionary work was in Ethiopia. Although its ruler, Emperor Susenyos, had publicly declared his conversion to Catholicism in 1622, the declaration of Roman Catholicism as the official religion in 1626 led to increasing civil war. Following Susenyos' abdication, his son and successor Fasilides expelled archbishop Afonso Mendes and his Jesuit brethren in 1633, then in 1665 ordered the remaining religious writings of the Catholics burnt. On the other hand, other missions were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The first Catholic Church was built in Beijing in 1650. The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci had modified the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among other things the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy in 1692 and 1742. Question: How many times did the Vatican forbaded any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy? Answer:","completion":"The Vatican forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy twice, in the years 1692 and 1742. These prohibitions were issued as a response to the attempts of missionaries, particularly Jesuits like Matteo Ricci, to adapt the Catholic faith to Chinese culture and customs in order to promote conversion and integration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room. Which sign's electrons are at a higher energy level? Hint: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.

Ebola can be spread in a number of ways, though primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and secretions of an infected patient. Contact with objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles have also been linked to the spread of the disease.","completion":"The most logical next event would be the implementation of preventive measures to reduce the spread of the Ebola virus. These measures can be taken on a personal, community, and global level to minimize the risk of outbreaks and to limit the overall impact of the disease. The following preventive strategies provide a comprehensive approach to curbing the spread of Ebola: 1. Public Education and Awareness: Raising awareness and providing accurate information to the public about the ways in which Ebola spreads is critical. Empowering people with knowledge on the transmission of the virus can significantly reduce common misconceptions about the disease and increase awareness of how to prevent infection. 2. Adherence to Standard Precautions: Healthcare professionals should be well-trained to recognize the symptoms of Ebola and follow standard precautionary measures to prevent the spread of infection. This includes using personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and masks when in direct contact with patients, practicing proper hand hygiene, and safely disposing of contaminated waste. 3. Screening and Isolation of Suspected Cases: Early detection and isolation of suspected Ebola cases can minimize the risk of spreading the virus to others. Healthcare facilities should be equipped to conduct rapid diagnostic tests and appropriate isolation procedures for those who present with Ebola-like symptoms or a travel history to affected areas. 4. Contact Tracing: When a confirmed case of Ebola is identified, it is essential to trace individuals who have had close contact with the infected person. This process helps prevent further transmission by identifying potential cases, monitoring their health status, and providing necessary care if they develop symptoms. 5. Safe Burial Practices: Cultural practices surrounding burial and funeral rites can sometimes contribute to the spread of Ebola. Implementing safe burial procedures, such as the use of trained teams in personal protective equipment, proper handling of the deceased's body, and disinfecting contaminated surfaces, can help mitigate the risk of contagion. 6. Travel Restrictions and Monitoring: Imposing travel restrictions and monitoring the movement of people from Ebola-affected regions can help to prevent the global spread of the virus. Public health authorities should also inspect incoming travelers for Ebola-like symptoms and consider implementing temperature screening at airports and other points of entry. 7. Community Engagement and Cooperation: Collaboration between affected communities, governmental agencies, and local and international organizations is essential for successful prevention and containment of Ebola outbreaks. Transparent communication and active involvement of community members in prevention efforts help to build trust and enhance the effectiveness of the response. 8. Investment in Research and Development: Encouraging research into Ebola can lead to medical advancements in prevention and treatment options. This includes the further development of effective vaccines, diagnostic tools, and therapeutic treatments that can significantly reduce the spread and impact of the disease. 9. Strengthening Healthcare Systems: Improving healthcare infrastructure and preparedness in Ebola-prone regions is essential to prevent future outbreaks. Ensuring adequate funding, improving access to care, training healthcare workers, and providing essential medical equipment and resources are crucial steps in building resilient health systems. By implementing these preventive measures and fostering international cooperation, we can effectively work to reduce the spread and impact of the Ebola virus and protect the health and well-being of individuals and communities worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...who took part in the battle of waterloo??","completion":"The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18, 1815, about 12 miles south of Brussels, in present-day Belgium. It marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and is considered one of the most pivotal battles in European history. The conflict involved several armies and commanders, with the principal forces being the French army under the command of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the Anglo-allied army commanded by the Duke of Wellington, supported by the Prussian army led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. 1. The French Army: Napoleon Bonaparte was the Emperor of France at the time of the Battle of Waterloo. After his exile to the island of Elba in 1814, he returned to France in March 1815 and reassembled the French forces. At Waterloo, Napoleon commanded the Armée du Nord, which consisted of several corps: - Imperial Guard: Napoleon's elite force, commanded by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon. - I Corps: Led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon, the I Corps was primarily composed of veterans from Napoleonic Wars. - II Corps: Commanded by Marshal Honoré Charles Reille, this corps mainly consisted of infantry divisions. - III Corps: Led by Count Louis-Nicolas Davout, Marshal of France, the III Corps bolstered Napoleon's forces with several infantry divisions. - IV Corps: Commanded by General Henri-Gatien Bertrand, the IV Corps contained various infantry divisions. - VI Corps: Led by Marshal Emmanuel de Grouchy, the VI Corps was composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry divisions. 2. The Anglo-Allied Army: The Anglo-Allied Army was a coalition force primarily composed of British, Dutch, and Hanoverian soldiers and led by Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington. The principal units in the Anglo-Allied Army during the Battle of Waterloo were: - I Corps: This was the main British force and was commanded by Lieutenant General George Earl of Uxbridge. - II Corps: Under the leadership of General Rowland Hill, this corps was composed of British, Dutch, and Hanoverian infantry and cavalry divisions. - Netherlands Army: Also known as the Dutch-Belgian Army, this force was commanded by Prince William of Orange and played a vital role in the early stages of the battle. 3. The Prussian Army: Led by Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the Prussian Army played a significant part in the outcome of the battle. Arriving later in the day, their support aided the Anglo-Allied forces in defeating the French. The Prussian army was organized into various corps, commanded by different generals: - I Corps: Commanded by General Johann David Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, this corps consisted of infantry and cavalry divisions. - II Corps: Under the command of General Friedrich Karl von Pirch, the II Corps was an essential force. - III Corps: Led by General Johann Friedrich von Thielmann, this corps was instrumental in the later stages of the battle. - IV Corps: Commanded by General Friedrich Wilhelm, Count of Bülow, this corps joined the battle later in the day and their arrival had a significant impact on the outcome. The Battle of Waterloo marked a turning point in European history, decisively defeating Napoleon and leading to his second and final exile on the remote island of Saint Helena.

Fact 1: Plant requires seed dispersal for reproduction. Fact 2: Try planting Sunflower seeds or another type of seed at your house. Given the two facts above, what do sunflowers need to procreate? Answer:","completion":"Given Fact 1: Plant requires seed dispersal for reproduction and Fact 2: Try planting Sunflower seeds or another type of seed at your house, we can deduce the following steps for sunflowers to procreate: Step 1: Identify the proper type of seeds required for sunflower reproduction. In this case, we need sunflower seeds. Step 2: Plant the sunflower seeds in a suitable environment at your house. This includes a fertile soil with good drainage and access to sunlight, as sunflowers need plenty of sunlight to grow and reproduce. Step 3: Ensure proper care for the sunflower plant, including adequate water and nutrients, as well as protection from pests and diseases. Step 4: The sunflower plant will eventually grow and produce flowers. These flowers will contain both male and female reproductive organs. The male organs produce pollen, while the female organs will develop into seeds after fertilization. Step 5: Pollination is required for the fertilization process. This can happen either through self-pollination (transfer of pollen within the same flower) or cross-pollination (transfer of pollen from one flower to another). Sunflowers typically rely on insects, such as bees, or wind for pollination. Step 6: After successful pollination and fertilization, the sunflower seeds will develop within the flower head. They need to be dispersed for further reproduction. Step 7: Seed dispersal occurs through various mechanisms, such as wind, animal consumption and spread, or human intervention (e.g., collecting seeds and planting them elsewhere). In conclusion, sunflowers need proper planting conditions, pollination, and seed dispersal for successful reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

First, we need to consider that the performance of players in the tournament can vary greatly. Some players may have had an outstanding tournament, catching the eye of scouts and clubs, and increasing their chances of signing with a professional team. On the other hand, some players may not have performed well, which could negatively affect their chances of being signed by clubs. Secondly, it is important to remember that not all teams and players in the U-20 World Cup have equal levels of exposure. Teams from more high-profile footballing nations receive more attention from scouts and clubs compared to teams from smaller, less established footballing nations. This can have an impact on the chances of players from lesser-known countries being discovered and signed by clubs, even if their performance in the tournament was outstanding. Moreover, external factors, such as injuries or the player's representation by an agent, can also affect their chances of signing with a professional team following the U-20 World Cup. The level of competition for places in top clubs is intense, and many factors come into play when clubs are choosing new signings. Lastly, while the U-20 World Cup can serve as an important platform for young players to showcase their talents, it is not the only avenue through which they can gain the attention of professional clubs. Players can also be discovered through domestic league performances or other international youth tournaments that take place throughout their careers. In conclusion, while the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup provided a significant opportunity for talented young players to impress potential suitors, it is impossible to say that all participating teenage players increased their chances of signing with a professional football team.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: The rehabilitation programming for the following movie plot: In 1996, psychopathic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a number of hostages and takes refuge with his gang in an abandoned building. LAPD Sgt. John Spartan uses a thermal scan of the building and finds no trace of the hostages, and leads an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. When he is captured, Phoenix sets off a series of explosives that bring down the building, and when the police search the wreckage, they find the corpses of the hostages. Spartan is charged with manslaughter, and he is incarcerated along with Phoenix in the city's new \\"California Cryo-Penitentiary\\", where they will be cryogenically frozen. During their time \\"in deep freeze\\", they are to be rehabilitated through subconscious conditioning. During their incarceration, the \\"Great Earthquake\\" leads the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara to merge into a single metropolis under the name San Angeles. The city becomes a utopia run under the pseudo-pacifist guidance and control of the evangelistic Dr. Raymond Cocteau, where human behavior is tightly controlled. In 2032, Phoenix is woken for a parole hearing, but he finds he somehow knows the access codes to the security systems, and is able to escape the prison and begins wreaking havoc on the city. The police, having not dealt with violent crime for many years, are unable to handle Phoenix and opt to wake Spartan and enlist his help. Spartan is assigned to Lieutenant Lenina Huxley to help with acclimation to the future, which he finds depressing. Others on the police force find his behavior brutish and uncivilized, though Huxley, who is fascinated by the lifestyles of the late 20th century, helps Spartan to overcome this, and the two grow close, despite the limitations on displays of public affection. They attempt to stop Phoenix from stealing 20th century weapons from a museum display, but Phoenix manages to escape.

Step 1: Understand the context First, it is crucial to understand the context in which ERISA is used. In this case, ERISA refers to a set of laws regulating employee benefit plans in the United States. Step 2: Identify the main components ERISA is primarily concerned with pension and welfare benefit plans, so it is important to note that these are the primary subjects of the legislation.

Q: Typical techniques for sequence classification are designed for well-segmented sequences which have been edited to remove noisy or irrelevant parts. Therefore, such methods cannot be easily applied on noisy sequences expected in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which integrates ideas from attention models and gated recurrent networks to better deal with noisy or unsegmented sequences. Specifically, we extend the concept of attention model to measure the relevance of each observation (time step) of a sequence. We then use a novel gated recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the final prediction. An important advantage of our approach is interpretability since the temporal attention weights provide a meaningful value for the salience of each time step in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our TAGM approach, both for prediction accuracy and interpretability, on three different tasks: spoken digit recognition, text-based sentiment analysis and visual event recognition.

Let's analyze each option and explain why \\"presence\\" is the best choice: 1. Overabundance - This term refers to an excess of something, which does not relate to what the child wants from his parents in terms of companionship or emotional support. 2. Comprehensive - This term means thorough or complete, typically in the context of understanding or coverage. It does not directly relate to what the child wants from his parents, as it does not convey the idea of emotional connection. 3. Plentitude - This term means an abundance or great amount of something. While the child may want ample attention from his parents, this choice does not directly express the emotional need for connection or support. 4. Superabundance - Similar to overabundance, this term refers to an excessive amount of something, which does not appropriately describe the child's desire for companionship from his parents. 5. Presence - This term refers to the state of being with someone, physically or emotionally. In this context, it best describes what the child desired from his parents. The child was lonely, which indicates that he wanted the comforting and supportive presence of his parents to alleviate his loneliness.

Possible answers: collect money from the man, go home with their purchases, thank the man A:","completion":"Given the context of the carboot sale and Jan successfully persuading the man to take the old ornament that Jan was selling, the man would most likely want to take the following steps: 1. Collect money from the man: Since the man has agreed to take the old ornament that Jan was selling, he would now want to collect the payment for it. It is customary during carboot sales for agreed-upon transactions to be followed by the buyer handing over the agreed amount for the purchase, and the seller collecting the payment. 2. Thank the man: After collecting the money from the man, it would be polite for Jan to thank the man for the purchase. Expressing gratitude is important in sales situations, and this can help build rapport between the two individuals and leave a positive impression on the man, who may then return for future purchases or recommend Jan's booth to others. 3. Package the ornament (if necessary): Depending on the nature and fragility of the old ornament, Jan might need to package the item for the man to ensure that it doesn't get damaged during transit. Some carboot sales provide packing materials such as bubble wrap, newspapers, or bags to help sellers package items for buyers. Jan should ensure the man is able to transport the ornament safely to his home. 4. Go home with their purchases: After the transaction is completed, the man would want to go home with his new-old ornament. He may continue browsing the carboot sale to see if there's anything else that catches his eye, or he may decide that the ornament was the only purchase he wanted to make that day. Regardless, the man's decision to take the old ornament that Jan was selling implies that he's found an item of interest or value, and he would eventually want to take it back to his home to enjoy it. Based on the given context and possible answers, the man's next actions would likely include having Jan collect money from him, potentially thanking Jan for the transaction, and eventually going home with his new acquisition.

Solution:","completion":"Task: Cook pasta, such as spaghetti or linguini. Step 1: Gather ingredients and tools - Pasta (spaghetti or linguini) - A large pot - Water - Salt - A colander or strainer - Tongs or a fork - A serving plate or bowl Step 2: Fill the pot with water Fill the large pot about three-quarters full with water. The water should be enough to fully submerge the pasta. Step 3: Add salt to the water Add a generous pinch of salt to the water. This helps to add flavor to the pasta as it cooks. Step 4: Bring water to a boil Place the pot on the stove and set the heat to high. Wait for the water to come to a rolling boil. Step 5: Add the pasta to the boiling water Once the water is boiling, carefully add the pasta to the pot. Spaghetti can be held at one end and gently lowered into the water as it starts to soften. Linguini can be gently spread out in the boiling water. Step 6: Stir the pasta Using tongs or a fork, gently stir the pasta to ensure it doesn't stick together or to the bottom of the pot. Continue to stir occasionally throughout the cooking process. Step 7: Cook the pasta Follow the package instructions for the recommended cooking time, which is usually around 8-12 minutes for spaghetti and linguini. The pasta should be cooked until it's al dente, which means it's cooked but still has a slightly firm texture. Step 8: Test pasta for doneness Using tongs or a fork, carefully remove a single strand of pasta from the pot and let it cool for a few seconds. Taste the pasta to ensure it's cooked to your desired level of doneness. Step 9: Drain the pasta Once the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and carefully pour the contents of the pot through a colander or strainer to drain the water. Step 10: Serve the pasta Place the drained pasta onto a serving plate or bowl, and add your desired sauce or toppings.

(CNN) -- The photographer who took images of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto moments before her assassination Thursday told CNN he was \\"surprised\\" to see her rise through the sunroof of her vehicle to wave to supporters after delivering her speech. Getty Images photographer John Moore captured Benazir Bhutto waving, moments before he heard gunshots. \\"I ran up, got as close as I got, made a few pictures of her waving to the crowd,\\" Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore told CNN's online streaming news service, CNN.com Live, in a phone interview Thursday from Islamabad, Pakistan. \\"And then suddenly, there were a few gunshots that rang out, and she went down, she went down through the sunroof,\\" he said. \\"And just at that moment I raised my camera up and the blast happened. ... And then, of course, there was chaos.\\" Watch Moore describe Bhutto's final moments » Moore said he was about 20 yards away from Bhutto's vehicle when he took his photographs. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Moore said he had been following Bhutto's story since her return to Pakistan in October. He was present October 19 when a terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi killed 136 people. In the aftermath of that attack, \\"The rallies had been very small,\\" because of high security, Moore said. However, the Rawalpindi rally was announced beforehand, he observed. \\"Whoever planned this attack -- they had time on their hands to plan everything properly, and you saw the results today,\\" he said. Between 5,000 and 8,000 were at the Rawalpindi rally, which was held at a parkground, he said. \\"We [the news media] all expected it to be filled ... but there were less people there than most of us expected to see,\\" he said. \\"When I talked with a number of people, they said that people were just afraid to come out, for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi.\\" Moore said he himself expected there could be another attack following the Karachi massacre. He said he stayed away from gates at the Rawalpindi parkground, where police were searching people, because he suspected that's where a bomb would go off. Question: \\"What was Moore doing moments before Benazir Bhutto was shot?\\" Answer: \\"Took images\\" Is this answer correct? (1). no. (2). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"(2). yes. The answer is correct. According to the text, John Moore was taking images of Benazir Bhutto moments before she was assassinated. This is clearly stated in the first sentence of the text: \\"The photographer who took images of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto moments before her assassination\\". Let's look at the other option: (1). no - This is not correct because the passage clearly states that Moore was photographing Bhutto right before the shooting occurred. Therefore, saying that he was not taking images would be inaccurate according to the details given in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Background: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. Paragraph: Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what were hamilton's goals for establishing a national bank Suggested answer: The President, Directors and Company, of the Bank of the United States, commonly known as the First Bank of the United States, was a central bank , chartered for a term of twenty years, by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"(ii). Yes. The suggested answer generally addresses the main topic, which is related to Alexander Hamilton's goals for establishing a national bank. However, it is important to provide a more comprehensive and elaborate answer to fully explore Hamilton's intentions behind the proposal. Alexander Hamilton, who served as the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, had three primary goals for establishing a national bank, known as the First Bank of the United States. 1. Strengthen the national government's financial position: Hamilton aimed to create a central institution that could manage the country's finances efficiently. At the time, the United States was burdened with substantial debts from the Revolutionary War, with individual states struggling to repay their own obligations. By implementing a national bank, Hamilton sought to consolidate these debts under the federal government and efficiently manage public finance policies, resulting in greater financial stability for the country as a whole. 2. Facilitate economic growth and development: Hamilton believed that a stronger, more centralized banking system would foster economic growth by providing an efficient means of credit and capital allocation for businesses and entrepreneurs. By establishing a national bank, the United States could supply new industries with sufficient capital to expand and create jobs, ultimately promoting economic growth and prosperity. Additionally, a centralized banking system would be able to regulate the money supply by issuing currency, thereby contributing to price stability and trade facilitation. 3. Promote confidence and trust in the nation's financial system: Following the Revolutionary War, the United States lacked a stable financial system that could represent the country's interests and foster trust among domestic and foreign investors. A national bank could serve as a catalyst for developing a robust financial market, providing essential services such as the issuance of currency, management of public debt, and acting as a depository for government funds. By creating a national bank, Hamilton aspired to facilitate greater trust between the government, its citizens, and foreign entities, leading to increased investments and a healthier economic climate. While the suggested answer provides a brief context about the First Bank of the United States and its charter established by Congress, it would be more helpful to include further information about the primary goals of this institution as outlined by Alexander Hamilton. Thus, validating the answer would be appropriate if it were expanded upon to elucidate Hamilton's economic and political objectives for the creation of a national bank."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The death of the actor was felt more by Justin than Logan because","completion":"Justin and Logan were both die-hard fans of the actor, but Justin's connection to him delved much deeper than Logan's. While Logan appreciated the acting skills, versatility, and undeniable charisma of the late artist in his array of blockbuster roles, for Justin, it was a profound and far more personal bond. Justin had discovered the actor during a challenging period in his life, specifically, in his late teenage years when he faced several difficulties which were overwhelming him. Justin struggled with bullying at school, severe anxiety, and pressure to succeed academically. His parents constantly fixated on his achievements, placing their expectations upon his shoulders. Justin found solace in the actor's films, often marathoning them during sleepless nights. There was something about the way the actor portrayed his characters that captivated Justin and provided him with a temporary escape from his problems. The more he watched, the more invested he became in the actor's career. For Justin, the actor's roles went beyond being mere forms of entertainment. He found life lessons in each of the characters portrayed by the actor. From the resilience of the protagonist in a heart-wrenching drama who overcame obstacles to find success, to the courage and empathy exhibited by the hero in a mesmerizing historical epic – each character provided Justin motivation and inner strength to face his own battles and challenges in life. Gradually, Justin began to notice improvements in his mental and emotional stability. He contributed a significant part of his growth to the late actor's work. As he ventured into adulthood, Justin carried the valuable lessons from the actor with him and tried to emulate them in his everyday decisions. This personal connection fueled his reverence and adoration for the actor beyond that of an ordinary fan. On the other hand, Logan was a casual admirer of the actor's work. He enjoyed the blockbuster movies, particularly those with action and suspense. Logan found himself drawn to the actor's on-screen magnetism and his ability to take on various roles without losing his authenticity. However, he lacked the intimate, emotional attachment to the actor that Justin had developed over the years. When the tragic news of the actor's demise shook the world, both Justin and Logan were undeniably affected. But the impact on Justin was significantly heavier. The actor's death left a gaping hole in Justin's life, causing a deep sense of loss and heartache reminiscent of losing a close friend or family member. Through the roughest moments in his life, the late artist had unknowingly been a source of comfort and inspiration. The loss for Justin was, therefore, more profound than it was for Logan. In conclusion, while Logan appreciated the artistic talent and charm of the actor in his numerous roles, Justin's connection to him transcended mere admiration. Justin found solace, inspiration, and strength in the actor's work, which helped him navigate through some of the most difficult times in his life. As such, the death of the actor was felt more deeply by Justin than by Logan, akin to the pain of losing someone dear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is my goal supposed to be buying my dream car(s)? Is my goal spiritual? I’m currently Catholic, but I’ve seen how spiritually those around me have changed. I’ve even wondered what’s the point of heaven, if everything I want is there. I like life because of the ups and the downs. I enjoy learning and discovering new things. The idea of perfection seems like an impossible concept to me. Maybe even an unenjoyable one. Maybe my goal is to have a family. Being catholic naturally we gravitate towards larger families. But as a libertarian I don’t see a lot of potential in the United States at it pertains to economic freedoms. I see the government encroaching more and more into our lives. Is this the type of country I want to raise a family in? I certainly don’t want to be outside the United States (no offense towards anyone outside of the U.S). Maybe my goal is political. I’ve always wanted to run for office. Maybe governor one day. Would I be able to avoid the waves of bipartisanship, and actually do what I believe is the best for the people of my state.

In your statement, you express uncertainty and questions about the point of life and what goals to strive for amidst varying concerns. It is natural to feel overwhelmed or struggle with finding a sense of purpose in life, as it is a complex and multifaceted journey. Breaking down your thoughts and addressing each of your concerns might help clarify your goals and the larger purpose you are seeking. 1. Monetary gain and material possessions: While these may initially seem like motivating factors, you might find more fulfillment by reflecting on the experiential joys that material possessions can bring, such as the memories and connections made while enjoying them, rather than the possessions themselves. 2. Spiritual goals: It is important to continually evaluate and explore your spiritual beliefs, as they can evolve over time. Engaging in personal reflection, researching various perspectives, and having open discussions with others can help clarify your spiritual path. 3. Perfection: Acknowledging that perfection is an unrealistic and potentially unenjoyable goal is an important realization. Instead, you might focus on striving for personal growth, adaptability, and resilience, allowing for a rich life experience that includes both ups and downs. 4. Family: Considering the type of environment and values you want to pass on to future generations is an integral step in deciding whether or not to raise a family. It might be helpful to weigh the pros and cons of raising a family in the United States or contemplating the values that you would prioritize as a parent. 5. Politics: Pursuing a political career that aligns with your core principles can be a fulfilling endeavor. Reflecting on the policies you would advocate for, as well as the potential challenges and pressures, will help you gauge your readiness and resilience for such a role. 6. Legacy: While it is true that most individual accomplishments fade from history, the impact you have on others through your actions and relationships can create a lasting ripple effect, positively influencing future generations. Seeking a purpose that transcends personal achievements, such as improving the lives of others or contributing to the well-being of your community, can provide a meaningful sense of purpose. As you navigate through these thoughts and concerns, remember that goals and purposes are not static; they can change and evolve over time. Continually reflecting, reassessing, and adjusting your aspirations can help create a fulfilling life experience."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.

Context: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Answer the following question: Process: - Food - Water enter the body - Bloodstream - Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas breaks down carbs - Helps digest other foods and liquids. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"a person doesnt have access to clean water\\" happens, how will it affect \\"the body isnt being hydrated\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process described involves the intake of food and water into the body, entering the bloodstream, and the role of the pancreas in breaking down carbohydrates and helping in the digestion of other foods and liquids. To answer the perturbation hypothesis: if a person does not have access to clean water, it will undoubtedly have effects on the body's ability to maintain proper hydration. The perturbation can influence the entire process, both directly and indirectly. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced water intake: Adequate clean water is crucial for maintaining hydration and ensuring the smooth digestion and absorption of nutrients. Insufficient water intake can lead to dehydration, leading to reduced blood volume, impaired circulation, and difficulty in nutrient absorption and transportation through the bloodstream. 2. Impaired digestion: Water is essential for the proper functioning of the digestive system. It helps in the breakdown of food and facilitates the absorption of nutrients by the bloodstream. A lack of sufficient water can lead to indigestion, resulting in discomfort and reduced nutrient absorption. 3. Pancreatic dysfunction: Water is necessary for proper digestion, as it allows the pancreas to secrete enzymes and hormones effectively. Insufficient hydration could negatively impact this process by inhibiting enzyme secretion and the appropriate breakdown of carbohydrates in the pancreas. Indirect Effects: 1. Increased risk of infection: Unclean water can contain bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause gastrointestinal illnesses. These infections can lead to diarrhea and vomiting, further exacerbating dehydration and disrupting the body's ability to absorb nutrients properly. 2. Malnutrition: Prolonged intake of contaminated water can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, as the body struggles to absorb them efficiently due to impaired digestion. Malnutrition can, in turn, compromise the body's immune system and overall functioning. 3. Electrolyte imbalances: Dehydration and diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated water can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can disrupt various bodily functions, including digestion. Electrolytes are vital for maintaining the balance of fluids within the body, enabling the proper absorption of nutrients, and ensuring that the pancreas can effectively secrete the necessary enzymes. In conclusion, the perturbation of not having access to clean water can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process of food and water entering the body, the bloodstream, and the role of the pancreas in digestion. Insufficient hydration can lead to a cascade of consequences, ultimately affecting the body's ability to properly absorb nutrients and maintain overall health. It is crucial to ensure access to clean water to promote adequate hydration, support digestive processes, and maintain overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He said the cuts would be \\"equivalent to 50p in every £100\\" of public spending by 2020, which was \\"not a huge amount in the scheme of things\\". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the world was \\"more uncertain\\" than at any time since the financial crisis. He said the UK needed to live within its means to withstand economic shocks. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment to enable the UK economy to \\"withstand the global headwinds\\". Mr Osborne warned of cuts to come in his upcoming Budget on 16 March in a BBC interview last month. Speaking on the Marr Show, Mr Osborne said the world was now \\"a more difficult and dangerous place\\" and warned about the state of the global economy. While Britain was better placed to cope with economic shocks compared with 2008, it was \\"not immune to what's going on\\", he said. \\"My message in this Budget is that the world is a more uncertain place than at any time since the financial crisis and we need to act now so we don't pay later,\\" he said. \\"That is why I need to find additional savings equivalent to 50p in every £100 the government spends by the end of the decade, because we've got to live within our means to stay secure. \\"That's the way we make Britain fit for the future.\\" The chancellor - whose Budget on Wednesday will be his eighth - said he thought the savings were achievable, but he would not be drawn on where the axe would fall. He said the government's plan had enabled it to invest in \\"the public's priorities\\", such as the NHS, science and education, infrastructure and defence, \\"while at the same time not spending more than the country can afford\\". Mr Osborne added that he wanted to boost productivity, improve Britain's schools and infrastructure and make taxes \\"more competitive\\". The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether fuel duty would be increased - something Tory backbenchers are urging him against. But he added: \\"On fuel duty, we had a manifesto commitment there and we have pencilled in fuel duty plans going forward but what I would say is, every time we can have our economy more competitive, we do.\\" Mr Osborne also rejected claims that the most vulnerable people would be hit in the Budget through cuts to disability benefits known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP). He said the government was \\"increasing spending on disabled people\\", but added that it was right to make sure the system was being \\"properly managed\\". Also on Marr, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment in the UK economy, specifically in skills, infrastructure and new technology. He said the chancellor had reduced investment to 1.4% of GDP which was \\"unacceptable\\", saying the OECD has said the figure should be at least 3%. \\"What I want to do is to make sure we invest in the long term and then we can withstand the global headwinds,\\" he added. He said prosperity needed to be \\"shared by all\\", saying the government's economic policies had created an \\"unequal\\" society. The chancellor has promised to get the books into surplus by 2020. In his November Autumn Statement, he watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments. He was able to do this owing to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt. BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said: \\"Only four months ago, when he made the Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne had sounded upbeat about the country's finances. \\"But now, with the size of the British economy much smaller than had been expected, it seems the chancellor has not left himself much wriggle room.\\" In his Marr interview, Mr Osborne also warned against the UK leaving the EU, saying it \\"would create an economic shock\\" that would \\"cost jobs\\" and \\"damage living standards\\". Leave campaigners say the UK could strike favourable trade deals with the EU after exit, arguing that Britain's future if better off outside.

Mr. Osborne is also planning to make the country better by improving things like schools, roads, and making taxes more fair.

With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes. Kamakura was falling apart. Question: \\"How did the economy collapse?\\" Response: \\"Earthquake\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. While the earthquake is mentioned as one of the factors that contributed to the empty treasury, it's not the only reason for the collapse of the economy.

British house price rises slightly for second month in September British housing market grew slightly for the second month in succession in September, showing further evidence of checking effects by five interest rates hikes since last November What is this text about?","completion":"The text is essentially about the recent developments in the British housing market. More specifically, it talks about the steady and continuous growth of housing prices for two consecutive months, in this case, August and September. The article seems to suggest that this upward trend in house prices is an indication that the market is gradually but consistently experiencing growth or at least stability, which is considered to be a positive sign in terms of the overall state of the economy. Furthermore, the text implies that the growth in house prices has managed to persist despite five interest rate hikes, instituted since the previous November. In general, interest rate hikes are intended to slow down the economy by making borrowing more expensive which in turn reduces spending and hence slows down inflation. When interest rates increase, people are less likely to take out mortgages due to higher costs, which can often lead to a decrease in demand for housing and therefore a drop in house prices. However, in this case, the British housing market has not followed this expected trend. Despite the increase in interest rates, the housing prices in Britain have continued to rise for two successive months. This could potentially suggest a strong demand for housing in Britain, either due to a shortage of supply, increased buying power of the public, or high investor confidence in the real estate market. It is also worthwhile to note that this trend might speak about the resilience of the British housing market which has checked, or resisted, the potentially negative impacts of the interest rate hikes. The continuous improvement in house prices may also indicate the strength and robustness of the housing sector within the larger framework of the British economy. However, a more in-depth analysis would be required to fully understand the reasons behind this scenario, as housing prices can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to government regulations, changes in demographic trends, and fluctuations in foreign investment. Irrespective of the causes, these indications of growth may inspire confidence in those dealing in or with the housing market, be it homeowners, buyers, investors, real estate companies, or even economic policy makers."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question 2: What is the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium? Select from: *no. *yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Question 1: 1. Atomic mass: Atomic mass is the mass of an atom, and it's usually measured in atomic mass units (amu). Imagine if an atom is a tiny jelly bean that has a certain weight. 2. Mass number: Mass number is the total number of protons and neurons in an atom. It's like counting all the red and blue balls inside a box. 3. Atomic weight: Atomic weight is the average mass of all atoms of an element found in nature, measured in amu. Think of it like taking a bunch of the same kind of jelly beans and finding their average weight. 4. Relative atomic mass: Relative atomic mass is the ratio of the average mass of one atom of an element to 1/12th of the mass of one carbon-12 atom. Imagine comparing the weight of one jelly bean to the weight of a special jelly bean (carbon-12), but we only consider 1/12th of that special jelly bean's weight. Question 2: To find the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium, you first need to know the atomic mass of potassium, which is about 39 amu. Multiply the atomic mass by the number of atoms: _mass = atomic mass x number of atoms_ _mass = 39 amu x 11 atoms_ _mass = 429 amu_ Now convert this mass from amu to grams using the conversion factor (1 amu = 1.66 x 10^-24 grams): _mass in grams = 429 amu x 1.66 x 10^-24 grams/amu_ _mass in grams ≈ 7.12 x 10^-23 grams_ So, the mass in grams of 11 atoms of potassium is approximately 7.12 x 10^-23 grams.

Paragraph: In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. Question: \\"Who was considered a threat to the U.S Government?\\" Answer: \\"Khaladan\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. Based on the paragraph, the threat to the U.S. government was considered to be Usama Bin Laden and his associates, not \\"Khaladan.\\" The Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, mentioned in the paragraph, was a training site where individuals like Raed Hijazi learned guerrilla warfare and became part of terrorist plots. However, the camp itself is not directly referred to as the threat; instead, the primary threat was Bin Laden and his organization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: Heat up leftovers evenly. Choices: (A). Place empty square in middle to space food out evenly. (B). Place empty circle in middle to space food out evenly. Answer:","completion":"(A). Place empty square in middle to space food out evenly. Explanation: When you want to heat up leftovers evenly in the microwave, it's a good idea to place an empty square in the middle and space your food out evenly around it. This way, the food will reheat more evenly, because the microwave's energy can reach all the parts of the food easily without overcooking some areas. Using an empty circle (option B) may not be as effective because it can leave some areas of the food closer together, which might cause uneven heating. The square shape ensures there's the same amount of space between each corner, helping the food heat up evenly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Now, I have a new situation: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Answer this question please: Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","completion":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This can be explained by the properties and behavior of polar compounds as well as the energy needed for the changes in their state. Polar compounds are formed when atoms unequally share their electrons, resulting in positive and negative electric charges within the molecule. This charge difference leads to the formation of dipoles, which in turn are responsible for the forces known as hydrogen bonds. Although hydrogen bonds are comparatively weaker than covalent or ionic bonds, their cumulative effects significantly influence the properties of polar compounds, including their melting and boiling points. The energy required for a polar compound to break these hydrogen bonds and change its state from solid to liquid (melting) or from liquid to gas (boiling) is higher than that required for nonpolar compounds, which lack these dipole-dipole interactions. This additional energy accounts for polar compounds having relatively high melting and boiling points than nonpolar compounds. In the given situation, Mike observed this phenomenon by changing the states of two different compounds. In case A, he melted a polar compound, effectively breaking the hydrogen bonds as energy was introduced. In case B, he melted a nonpolar compound, which lacks hydrogen bonds and thus required less energy for the same state transition. Given the background information and the experimental setup, it can be deduced that compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point than compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is due to the additional energy needed to overcome the hydrogen bonds in polar compounds and the absence of such bonds in nonpolar compounds."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a statement written in Malayalam.

Answer the following question: What causes Jefferson to receive severe burns? Answer the above question based on the context below: Jefferson Reed is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis. Confiding this to his parents Ted and Maxine, they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords. He shuts down 15 crack houses, stops 11 robberies, brings peace between the police, the Crips, and the Bloods where they begin to work together to rebuild the community they destroyed, and plants a giant garden in the middle of the ghetto.

In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose.

Plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final.

There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies? This film rips the guts out of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. Orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a bleak, grey, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers. But this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. Worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all for nothing. This film made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft-centred, anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their Horlicks and quietly doze off. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses frustration, disappointment, and anger at the way the film adaptation of Orwell's novel has been handled. They criticize the directorial choices, the \\"talentless nobodies\\" involved, and the way the film waters down the original story's themes and impact.

It shows growth from a band that has been around over a decade, with songs such as Everything I Know or Counting on Me. It shows that even though you can grow as artists you can still remember your roots, such as Let's Do This Now where Jon Davis brings back his bagpipes or the Duet with Nas on Play Me. The sound is more aggressive, which is something you would think would be hard to do with the bass lines produce from Fieldy's Bass. Jon does just an awesome variety on his vocals. While David shows what I think is a different style of playing the drums, and it works on this album. Lets not leave out Head and Munky, the guitars are here, and they are very good. They are heavy and they are very different, which is good on this CD. Much has changed since the days of Self-Titled, but with this album Korn shows that even though you can mature as artists, you can always remember where you came from and produce a hard hitting song. Is the review positive or negative? A:","completion":"The review is positive. The reviewer speaks highly of Korn's growth as a band and their ability to maintain their roots while evolving with their music. They praise various aspects of the album, such as Jon Davis's vocals, the bass lines produced by Fieldy, and the diverse guitar work from Head and Munky. The reviewer also commends David's drumming style and how it complements the aggressive sound of the album. They acknowledge the changes since the days of Self-Titled but appreciate how Korn can still produce hard-hitting songs while showing their maturity as artists. Overall, the review shows a favorable appreciation for the \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" album."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It may have changed owners since then...not sure...We live in McDowell Mountain Ranch and like to frequent our neighborhood restaurants and 'keep it in the community' as much as possible. Yes, this place has decent 2-4-1 happy hour... BUT IT IS DDDDDDISGUSTING!!!!!! Their sushi is terrible, and we've even gone back for more punishment to give it a 2nd and 3rd chance because it is sooo close to our house. Anyone who thinks that their sushi is great obviously does NOT know what sushi is supposed to taste like. If you want to eat badly undercooked, over riced, messy looking rolls, go right ahead, I warned you. All their rolls look look like futomaki rolls LOL The regular food is decent, but overpriced for what you get. 13 for Chicken Teriyaki? 15 for a meager portion of salmon? Uhhh, I think that is a royal rip off. I feel bad, because I know these are rough times for businesses, and the place has been pretty dead every time we've been in, but you would think that when times are this hard, and one has so many options of places to eat, that at least the service would improve! The very last (I mean it this time!) time we were there, we sat at the bar to grab a quick bite. The bartender/server didn't even acknowledge us for drinks several minutes, even though he saw us sitting there, and one other table, to the point where we almost walked out to go elsewhere. Now we know better and drive to Sushi Brokers for their happy hour instead. You should too! Choices: (A). negative (B). positive","completion":"The following review is (A). negative. The review contains numerous complaints about different aspects of the restaurant experience. The mention of the place being good in the past implies that the current state of the restaurant is not up to par. Reasons for this negative review include dissatisfaction with the quality of sushi, claims of overpricing for meals, and subpar service, particularly from the bartender/server. The reviewer feels that their expectations were not met and that there are better alternatives like Sushi Brokers for happy hour. In addition to the specific criticisms, the overall tone of the review is negative. The text is filled with negative descriptors, such as \\"DDDDDDISGUSTING\\", \\"badly undercooked\\", \\"over riced\\", \\"messy looking rolls\\" and \\"royal rip off\\".

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Venice, California, student Daisy (Merissa Mathes) leaves a club alone after having an argument with her beatnik boyfriend Max (Carl Schanzer). Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \\"Dead Red Nudes,\\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders...

In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred. Question: \\"Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most of the surrounding counties the criminal contempt charge is what?\\" Answer: \\"She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct.

While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement.

Information: - An expansion team is a brand new team in a sports league, usually from a city that has not hosted a team in that league before, formed with the intention of satisfying the demand for a local team from a population in a new area. Sporting leagues also hope that the expansion of their competition will grow the popularity of the sport generally. The term is most commonly used in reference to the North American major professional sports leagues but is applied to sports leagues in other countries with a closed franchise system of league membership. The term comes from the expansion of the sport into new areas. That sometimes results in the payment of an expansion fee to the league by the new team and an expansion draft to populate the new roster. - Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951) is an American football coach who is the head coach and executive vice president of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL).

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - A quarterback (commonly abbreviated to QB) is a position in American and Canadian football.

In terms of structure, components, and electrochemical reactions, it closely resembles commercial batteries. The battery is composed of an anode, cathode, and an electrolyte separator, all enclosed within two layers of polyvinyl alcohol-based polymer. A distinguishing characteristic of this battery is its ability to dissolve when dropped in water. The dissolving process takes about half an hour and occurs when the polymer casing of the battery swells upon contact with water, causing the electrodes to break apart. However, it should be noted that this dissolution is not complete, given that the battery contains nanoparticles that do not degrade. This battery is capable of producing 2.5 volts, sufficient to power a desktop calculator for about 15 minutes. The potential uses of this technology could extend to keeping military secrets confidential and aiding in environmental monitoring devices. However, one considerable limitation is that this form of the battery cannot be used within the human body due to its lithium content, though research is underway to investigate the potential for harmlessly dissolvable batteries that could avoid the necessity for painful removal procedures. This novel creation could contribute significantly toward curtailing the waste generated from discarded electronics.

Answer the following question: Why was the corporal seated ?","completion":"The corporal was seated in a wheelchair, which indicates that he might have experienced an injury, disability, or medical condition that affected his mobility and limited his ability to stand or walk. In this context, him being in a military unit also raises the likelihood that his condition might have resulted from an accident or incident during his military service. There are several possible explanations as to why the corporal was seated in a wheelchair: 1. Combat-related injury: It is quite possible that the corporal sustained an injury during deployment in combat or while participating in a military operation. The injury could have resulted in partial or complete paralysis, amputation, or severe damage to his musculoskeletal system, rendering him temporarily or permanently unable to walk or stand. 2. Training or exercise-related injury: Military personnel undergo extensive and rigorous training regimens, often putting their bodies under significant physical stress. Injuries during training or physical exercise can lead to mobility impairments, requiring the use of a wheelchair. 3. Medical condition or disease: The corporal might be suffering from a medical condition or disease that impacts his mobility. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or other neurological or muscular disorders could lead to difficulties in walking or standing and result in the need for a wheelchair. 4. Temporary immobilization: The corporal might be using the wheelchair temporarily while recovering from a surgery, illness, or a non-military related accident. In such cases, he might regain his ability to walk or stand as he heals and rehabilitates. Regardless of the exact reason, the corporal's situation highlights the challenges faced by many military service members who suffer from physical disabilities or injuries. These brave individuals often require specialized care and support, which is where a clinical psychologist like the person mentioned in the text comes into play. As a Navy clinical psychologist assigned to a Marine operational unit, her role is to provide psychological and emotional support to military personnel who have undergone traumatic experiences, injuries, or other hardships during their service.

This disturbing case has garnered significant attention and outrage throughout the country, while shining a light on the importance of addressing historical child abuse cases. In this article, we will delve into the background of the Catholic boys' home, the alleged perpetrators, details of the alleged crimes, and the ongoing investigation and legal proceedings. Background of the Catholic Boys' Home The Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire is an institution that has served as a haven for orphaned and vulnerable boys throughout the years. While the institution was established to provide shelter, education, and spiritual guidance to the boys, allegations of horrific abuse at the hands of two men have tainted its reputation and left an indelible mark on its history. These distressing claims have not only made headlines, but also triggered a deeper examination of similar institutions and the need for thorough investigations into past criminal behavior. The Alleged Perpetrators The two men accused of these harrowing crimes are now aged 70 and 73, respectively. As longstanding members of the Catholic boys' home in the 1970s and '80s, they were entrusted with the responsibility of caring for and guiding their young charges. However, the allegations against them have led to widespread shock and have brought about serious questions regarding their motives, the abuse of power within religious institutions, and how such abhorrent acts were allowed to continue - if they did - for such a prolonged period of time. Details of the Alleged Crimes In the ongoing trial, it has been claimed that the two men perpetrated various forms of abuse against 26 children, highlighting the sheer extent of their alleged crimes. With the victims ranging in age from 11 to 16 years old, these allegations paint a gruesome picture of the daily life these young boys faced. The charges against the two men range from indecent assault, encouraging and participating in lewd activities, to physical assault and battery. It is important to remember that at this stage, these allegations have not yet been proven and the men have entered a plea of 'not guilty.' The Investigation and Legal Proceedings The Bedfordshire Police, in a collaborative effort with the Crown Prosecution Service, launched a case against the two accused earlier this year. Given the severity and historical nature of the alleged crimes, the investigation had to be thorough and meticulous, taking into account all available evidence from the time to piece together an accurate depiction of events that took place over four decades ago. During the trial, both the prosecution and defense teams have presented their case to the jury, with the victims bravely providing their personal accounts and testimonies. The lengthy and complex trial has seen numerous witnesses take the stand, as the two men in question continue to stake their claim of innocence. The defense team has argued that the men's prolonged history at the institution is evidence that these allegations are fabricated and unfounded. With the accused maintaining their innocence, it is up to the jury to carefully consider the evidence presented, assess the credibility of both the victims and the defense, and ultimately arrive at a verdict. Conclusion The alleged abuse of 26 children at a Catholic boys' home in Bedfordshire is a deeply unsettling case that has ignited righteous public outrage. The ongoing legal proceedings have placed immense pressure on the prosecution to seek justice for the victims and ensure the truth is uncovered and acknowledged. As the trial continues, the world watches on and waits with bated breath for the jury's decision, which will have a profound impact on the broader conversation surrounding historical child abuse cases and the management of religious institutions in the UK."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, answer the following question. Probably how long was the video the author made? Choose from: 1. the video was probably 4 hours long; 2. the video was probably 8 hours long; 3. the video was probably about an hour or less long; 4. not enough information; The answer is:","completion":"3. the video was probably about an hour or less long"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Persona Movie plot: Persona begins with images of camera equipment and projectors lighting up and projecting dozens of brief cinematic glimpses, including a crucifixion, an erect penis, a tarantula spider, clips from a comedic silent-film reel first seen in Bergman's Prison (depicting a man trapped in a room, being chased by Death and Satan), and the slaughter of a lamb. The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera. As the two women leave the hospital together, Alma reads aloud a letter Elisabet's husband has sent her, which includes a photograph of her young son. Together in the administrator's cottage, Elisabet begins to relax, though she remains completely silent and non-responsive. Alma speaks constantly to break the silence, at first about books she is reading and trivial matters, then increasingly about her own anxieties and relationship with her fiancÃ©, Karl-Henrik, who scolds her for lacking ambition â \\"though not with my career, I suppose in some greater way.\\" Alma constantly compares herself to Elisabet and begins to grow attached to her. As the act closes, Alma confesses to cheating on her fiancÃ© in a mÃ©nage Ã quatre with underage boys. She became pregnant, and had Karl-Henrik's friend abort the baby; \\"and... My question: what does alma discover in elisabet's letters? Answer:","completion":"In the movie Persona, Alma discovers a letter written by Elisabet that describes her thoughts on Alma.

The discovery of the letter initiates a shift in their relationship dynamic and raises questions about the nature of their identities and the boundaries between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered.\\" correctly answer the question of What reinforcements were the Saxons expecting?","completion":"No, the statement \\"The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered\\" does not directly answer the question of what reinforcements the Saxons were expecting. The statement merely provides information on the state of preparedness and organization of the Saxon and Austrian armies at a given time. To correctly answer the question of what reinforcements the Saxons were expecting, it is important to gather more information about the context, such as the specific historical event, battle, or time period being referred to, as well as any alliances or military agreements that may have been in place. Once the context is established, a more detailed response addressing the specific reinforcements the Saxons were expecting can be provided. For instance, if the question refers to the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), then the Saxons were expecting reinforcements from their allies, including Austria, Russia, France, and Sweden. The Austrians were their main ally, and they fought together against Prussia, led by King Frederick the Great, who aimed to expand his kingdom's territories by invading Saxony. The Austrian army played a significant role in providing support to the Saxons during this conflict. Other allies, such as Russia and France, also sent their troops to bolster the Saxon and Austrian defenses against Prussia. Although the statement initially mentioned the unprepared nature of the Saxon and Austrian forces, it does not answer directly the question about the expected reinforcements. A more accurate response would thus include details about the specific countries and armies supporting the Saxony and their contributions to the overall conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bevan Foundation outlined what it thinks Wales' economic priorities should be, following an invitation for views from the Welsh Government. They include all public sector employers paying workers the voluntary Living Wage within a year. The Welsh Government said it will consider the report. In October it was announced the UK voluntary Living Wage was to rise to Â£8.45 per hour. The foundation's submission said despite Wales' good performance \\"some major challenges remain.\\" These are highlighted as a shortage of jobs in some part of the country. For example Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff have barely half the number of jobs per head of working-age population compared with the UK average. The report said where there has been employment growth, much of the increase has been in self-employment, part-time working and temporary jobs. The report said wages, especially low wages, have been stagnant over the last six years with some parts of Wales experiencing a decrease in earnings. In Blaenau Gwent earnings have not kept up with inflation, meaning the average worker is more than Â£70 a week worse off than in 2002. Brexit was said to pose a new challenge, with concerns about the consequences for Wales' 500 foreign-owned companies and its Â£1 billion of exports each quarter. The Bevan Foundation recommends that the Welsh Government's economic policies should promote \\"inclusive growth\\". This involves combining the aim of growing prosperity, such as increasing employment, with the aim of increasing inclusion, such as addressing low wages. The report said: \\"The Welsh Government has made good progress in encouraging the adoption of the voluntary Living Wage in the public sector, including the NHS, further education colleges and some local authorities.\\" But it adds that \\"much more could be done to increase take-up.\\" The foundation calls on the Welsh Government to require all public sector employers to pay the voluntary Living Wage to workers within a year, and to sub-contractors by 2019. Inclusive growth should also address inequalities in the labour market. The report states less than half of disabled people are in work, as are less than two-thirds of people from an ethnic minority. The report concludes by saying: \\"Although Wales' economy and employment have made good progress, there are still too many people in Wales for whom a secure, decently paid job is just a pipedream. \\"We welcome the Welsh Government's commitment to prosperity for all, and recommend that its commitment be turned into reality.\\" The Welsh Government said it welcomed the report. A spokesman said: \\"We will consider it along with the others we have received as we take forward our work to build the confident, bright, prosperous and dynamic economy all parts of Wales deserve. \\"We are also developing a fresh approach to improving prosperity in the south Wales valleys, which is being driven by a new ministerial taskforce.\\" This article was about:","completion":"The Bevan Foundation has urged the Welsh Government to adopt the voluntary Living Wage for all public sector employers, and promote \\"inclusive growth\\" in the region.

Premier League One significant feature of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the dominance of the so-called \\"Big Four\\" clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. During this decade, and particularly from 2002 to 2009, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive, with Arsenal going as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that \\"Big Four\\" dominance threatened the division, \\"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\\" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \\"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\\" Q: Which of the \\"Big Four\\" teams did not lose a single game in the 2003-04 season?","completion":"The team among the \\"Big Four\\" that did not lose a single game in the 2003-04 season of the Premier League was Arsenal. This remarkable feat is famously referred to as \\"The Invincibles\\" season. Guided by coach Arsène Wenger, Arsenal became the second team in English Football history, after Preston North End (in 1888-89), to finish a top division season unbeaten. The \\"Invincibles\\" consisted of a line-up of notable players such as Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Kolo Toure, Freddie Ljungberg, and Jens Lehmann among others, who collectively contributed to this historic achievement. A blend of tactical brilliance, technical prowess, and consistency in performance allowed this team to register 26 wins and 12 draws in 38 games throughout the season, tallying up to a total of 90 points. Arsenal's unbeaten run actually extended to a record 49 matches, from May 2003 to October 2004. This string of performances has been often deemed as one of the greatest feats in Premier League history, setting a benchmark for teams to strive for. The 2003-2004 Premier League trophy is the last league trophy that Arsenal has won as of now, and the club's fans often look back at this season with fond memories. Thus, Arsenal's 2003-04 season stands as a significant chapter in the Premier League's history, marking the dominance of the 'Big Four' during the mid-2000s and Arsenal's contribution to it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey. \\"What do you want?\\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods.

There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals. An unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \\"Who are you?\\" \\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\\" Patch said. \\"Who are you that asks?\\" \\"I am Snout,\\" the rat replied. \\"Why are you here?\\" \\"I came to look for food.\\" \\"This is our food.

Paragraph: Pneumonia is a serious problem worldwide. We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia. To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and the fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kB, type I and II IFN, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways. Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection. Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly up-regulated. Taken together, stimulated innate resistance appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens. Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

Therefore, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis that Dorcas was wrong is true. To delve a bit deeper, when we say \\"Dorcas was quite right,\\" we are affirming the correctness of Dorcas' assertions, decisions, perspectives, or actions, based on the context in which this statement is made. This could relate to a wide variety of things - a prediction she made, a decision, her perspective on a matter, etc. Let's say, for instance, Dorcas asserted that it would rain tomorrow and it did. In this case, we could definitely say \\"Dorcas was quite right.\\" On the other hand, when we propose the hypothesis \\"Dorcas was wrong,\\" we are negating the correctness of whatever Dorcas might have said, done, or decided. This proposal contradicts the affirmation made in the premise. Hence, simply put, if we have established that \\"Dorcas was quite right,\\" we cannot also claim that \\"Dorcas was wrong.\\" The two cannot be simultaneously true. So, if we are to believe the initial premise to be true, which is that Dorcas was quite right, then we must conclude that the hypothesis that Dorcas was wrong is not correct.

Here's how we can make one together: 1. Gather Ingredients: First, let's find some yummy things from your kitchen! We will need: - 1 small cucumber (it's like a green, bumpy sausage) - 2 tablespoons of honey (that sticky, sweet stuff) - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (it's sour and comes from a lemon) 2. Wash Cucumber: Ask a grown-up to help you rinse the cucumber under water. We don't want any dirt or germs on it! 3. Blend It: Now, we need a blender (a spinning machine that makes things smooth). Put the cucumber inside and blend it until it's very smooth. Like a green milkshake! 4. Mix Ingredients: In a big bowl, let's mix the cucumber, honey, and lemon juice. We're going to need a spoon to help stir them together. It should look like a gooey mixture. 5. Test and Apply: Ask your grown-up to help put a tiny bit of the mixture on your skin to make sure it feels okay. If it feels good, use your fingers to put the mixture gently all over your face. Avoid your eyes and mouth! 6. Wait Time: While the mixture is on your face, let's wait for about 15 minutes. You can sing, dance, or tell stories during this time! 7. Rinse: After 15 minutes, ask the grown-up to help you wash the mixture off your face with warm water. Gently pat your face dry with a soft towel. 8. All Done: Wow, look at you! Your skin should feel nice and fresh now! Always remember to ask a grown-up for help when you're trying new things. And have fun with your natural skin peel!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The correct answer to the question should mention the \\"action potential.\\" You should not validate the suggested answer. Instead, you can use the following information to answer the question: When a neuron is excited, it generates an electrical signal known as an action potential. The action potential is a brief, rapid depolarization and repolarization of the neuron's membrane voltage. This is caused by a series of ion channel openings, which allow positive ions to enter the cell and negatively charged ions to leave, followed by a return to the resting state. The action potential propagates along the axon of the neuron and eventually reaches the synaptic terminals, where it leads to the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and interact with the receptors of the next neuron in the signaling pathway, potentially exciting or inhibiting it. The process of an action potential generation and propagation is essential for neural communication and processing within the nervous system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bamboozled Context: Pierre Delacroix (whose real name is Peerless Dothan), is an uptight, Harvard University-educated black man, working for the television network CNS. At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash. Meanwhile, an underground, militant rap group called the Mau Maus, led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the content of the show. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to bring the show down...

Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

In the first sentence: \\"The planes don't connect and you will have to wait for four hours.\\" Here, the word \\"connect\\" refers to the arrangement of flights to facilitate efficient and smooth transfers between them. Specifically, when two or more flights are scheduled such that passengers can disembark one flight and easily transfer to another, those flights are said to connect. In this case, the sentence implies that the flights are not scheduled in a way that enables quick transfers, which means passengers must wait four hours before they can board the connecting flight.

When the speaker requests the operator to \\"connect\\" them to someone, they're basically asking for help in setting up a communication channel between them and the intended recipient, which in this case is the Raffles hotel in Singapore.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Deadman 's Curve is a 1978 made for TV film based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence . Developed from a 1974 article published in the Rolling Stone magazine by Paul Morantz , who also helped write the screenplay . - The Synanon organization, initially a drug rehabilitation program, was founded by Charles E. \\"Chuck\\" Dederich, Sr., (19131997) in 1958 in Santa Monica, California, United States. By the early 1960s, Synanon had also become an alternative community, attracting people with its emphasis on living a self-examined life, as aided by group truth-telling sessions that came to be known as the \\"Synanon Game.\\" Synanon ultimately became the Church of Synanon in the 1970s, and disbanded permanently in 1991 due to many criminal activities, including attempted murder of which members were convicted, and legal problems, including losing its tax free status retroactively with the Internal Revenue Service due to financial misdeeds, destruction of evidence and terrorism. It has been called one of the \\"most dangerous and violent cults America had ever seen.\\" - Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera \\"Crotalus\\" and \\"Sistrurus\\" of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina. - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - A teleplay is a screenplay or script used in the production of a scripted television program or series. In general usage, the term is most commonly seen in reference to a standalone production, such as a television film, a television play or an episode of an anthology series; in internal industry usage, however, all television scripts (including episodes of ongoing drama or comedy series) are teleplays, although a \\"teleplay\\" credit may be subsumed into a \\"written by\\" credit depending on the circumstances of its creation. - Self-help or self-improvement is a self-guided improvementeconomically, intellectually, or emotionallyoften with a substantial psychological basis. Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, leaders. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and Twelve-Step culture, such as recovery, dysfunctional families, and codependency have become firmly integrated in mainstream language. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show). - Paul Morantz is an American attorney and investigative journalist. He is known for taking legal cases alleging brainwashing by cults, self-help groups and for sexual misconduct by psychotherapists. He is considered an expert on these subjects. His successful prosecution of Synanon led to an attempt against his life, by means of a rattlesnake. - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'television film'.

Intrigued by the opportunity to expose this criminal organization, Max dives deep into a thorough investigation that leads him to uncover a hidden world of betrayal, espionage, and war crimes. Emerging with a critical piece of information, Max learns of a planned underground meeting of key ODESSA members, set to take place in the heart of Berlin. Act 2: Having infiltrated the secret meeting, Max risks his life to document and collect audio evidence of ODESSA's sinister plots. Among the shadowy conspirators, he recognizes a well-respected local politician named Conrad Richter. Max is stunned and begins to question all he knows, fearing the reach of ODESSA extends further than he could have ever imagined. Determined to reveal the extent of ODESSA's influence, Max joins forces with his estranged sister, Elisa, who is an undercover British intelligence agent. As Max and Elisa work together, they unearth a network of safe houses, escape routes, and hidden resources ODESSA members use to smuggle high-ranking Nazi officers out of Germany and into countries like Argentina and Egypt. Elisa, driven by a thirst for vengeance for the death of their parents during the war, convinces Max to coordinate with the British and American forces to launch a covert operation against ODESSA. Act 3: As they work to dismantle the organization, Max and Elisa grapple with the moral implications of their actions, their tumultuous relationship, and the gruesome realities of war. Max struggles with the decision to expose Conrad Richter, whose possible involvement with ODESSA threatens to destroy his life and family, and Elisa is haunted by the memory of her parents, whose deaths have driven her to the brink of obsession. In an action-packed climax, the brother-sister duo leads an international task force in a high-stakes raid on ODESSA's primary fortress. Lives are lost, secrets are uncovered, and the true extent of the organization's influence is finally revealed. Richter, unable to escape his association with ODESSA, confronts his past and sacrifices his life to save Max and Elisa. Epilogue: Exhausted and forever changed by their experiences, Max and Elisa present their findings to the public, sparking global condemnation. ODESSA is effectively dismantled, and its remaining members are brought to justice. Max and Elisa receive accolades for their contributions but choose to retreat from the public eye, seeking solace in the knowledge that their actions have prevented further atrocities and heinous acts. Their experience fighting against ODESSA only brings Max and Elisa closer as siblings. They vow to continue seeking justice and strive for a more peaceful and equitable world through journalism and espionage – creating an unwavering bond of loyalty and self-discovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hint: Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a mass extinction in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual. A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago.

Answer a question about this article: The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism. Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy states that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman. What state in life does yoga believe is achievable?","completion":"Yoga believes that a state of liberation or freedom, known as moksha, is achievable in this life. This state of liberation occurs when an individual completely understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman, which represent the ultimate reality and the underlying divine essence of the universe, respectively. By recognizing the unity of these two concepts, one can attain self-realization and experience spiritual freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, as well as transcend the illusions and limitations of the material world. The Yoga school proposes that the path to moksha combines systematic techniques and personal experimentation with the approach to knowledge found in the Samkhya school. Samkhya emphasizes the importance of jñāna (knowledge) as a means to liberation, and Yoga takes this further by incorporating practices such as meditation, moral disciplines, and physical postures to help individuals gain self-realization and liberation. It is also worth noting that Yoga shares several core ideas with Advaita Vedanta, another school of Hindu philosophy. Both schools assert that liberation is attainable during one's lifetime and that realizing the equivalence of Atman and Brahman is essential for achieving spiritual freedom. However, they differ in their approaches, as Yoga is considered a form of experimental mysticism focused on practical techniques, while Advaita Vedanta is described as a form of monistic personalism that centers on the unity of all existence through contemplation and philosophical inquiry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — The United States is escalating trans-Atlantic and North American trade tensions, imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico beginning on Friday. The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is... After the end of the story, Macron probably is A.

Major changes include Chrystia Freeland's move from international trade to foreign affairs. Immigration and democratic reform portfolios are affected, along with one key diplomatic post. It is the first major cabinet shuffle since Mr Trudeau took power in November 2015 and comes as Ottawa prepares for a protectionist administration about to take power in the US. President-elect Donald Trump is to be sworn in on 20 January. Chrystia Freeland, who helped prevent the collapse of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) last October, will be one of Canada's main voices on the world stage as new global affairs minister. She will retain the Canada-US relations file, including trade relations with Canada's largest trading partner. Ms Freeland has lived in both Russia and the US, and spent time in Moscow as the former bureau chief of the Financial Times. She is known to be well connected in Washington. While she is also known in Moscow, Ms Freeland does not have the warm relationship her incoming US counterpart Rex Tillerson has with Russian officials. In fact, she is currently banned from Russia. Ms Freeland, who has been outspoken in her support of Ukraine, was one of 13 Canadian officials and politicians sanctioned by Moscow in 2014 in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Canada over Russia's annexation of Crimea. Mr Trudeau praised Ms Freeland as an \\"extremely strong member of the team\\" and for her handling of the Ceta file, and brushed off any possible tensions with Russia. \\"As to how she gets a long with Russia, well, she speaks fluent Russian,\\" he said. Ms Freeland also waved off her ban from Russia, saying it was an issue for Moscow to tackle. She is being replaced at international trade by neophyte MP Francois-Philippe Champagne, a trade lawyer, who will work closely with Ms Freeland on a portfolio that includes Ceta and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Mr Trump has said he wants to either renegotiate or scrap Nafta altogether and has said he will quit the TPP on his first day in the White House. Speaking in context of his re-shuffled team, Mr Trudeau noted on Tuesday that \\"obviously the new administration to the south will offer both opportunities and challenges as well as a shift in global context\\". Ms Freeland is replacing Stephane Dion, who announced on Tuesday that he was leaving politics after 21 years. He has been offered an ambassadorial position by the prime minister. John McCallum, who helped oversee efforts to fast-track 25,000 Syrian refugees into the country, is being shuffled from the immigration portfolio and will become Canada's new ambassador to China. The veteran politician will help oversee the country's move to deepen economic ties with China, including exploring a possible free trade deal with the Asian nation. Senior officials in the Trudeau government have been working hard to lay the groundwork for the new relationship between Canada and the US as Mr Trump prepares to replace President Barack Obama. They have been meeting regularly with members of Mr Trump's advisory team since the presidential election south of the border, and there have been efforts to reach out to lawmakers from the 35 northern US states. Two of Mr Trudeau's top aides met last week with Mr Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon and the president-elect's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, according to reports. Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who helped negotiate Nafta, has also been playing an intermediary role between Ottawa and Washington.","completion":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's first cabinet reshuffle, that affects six cabinet posts, aims to prepare Canada for a protectionist US administration.

In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: The answer is:","completion":"Earth would travel a shorter distance than Neptune."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book. I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person. \\"Anne Frank's Family\\" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out. I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Like millions of people who read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage.

Dorothy Jane Roberts (May 8, 1929 - September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, self-proclaimed psychic, and spirit medium, who claimed to channel an energy personality who called himself \\"Seth.\\" Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the Seth Material, established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena. The Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090), which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings, and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations. Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of \\"The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book,\\" published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library), contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. Marianne Williamson, Deepak Chopra, Shakti Gawain, Dan Millman, Louise Hay, Richard Bach, and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: \\"Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life.\\" Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the University of Chicago, stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material \\"launched an era of nationwide awareness\\" of the channeling trend. She believes it contributed to the \\"self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks.\\" John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: \\"you create your own reality.\\" (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations. Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the \\"Seth Material.\\" Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at Bradley University, wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called \\"unchurched American spirituality,\\" related to concepts of reincarnation, karma, free will, ancient metaphysical wisdom, and \\"Christ consciousness.\\" Some writers noted, \\"Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East... and we've done a little reading on Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen, and Taoism, for example, not to mention subjects like shamanism, voodooism, and obeah.\\" The late amateur physicist Michael Talbot wrote, \\"To my great surprise--and slight annoyance--I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both paranormal phenomena and quantum physics.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was the idea behind the central focus of the Seth material?","completion":"The idea behind the central focus of the Seth Material is that \\"you create your own reality.\\" This concept suggests that an individual's beliefs generate emotions, which in turn trigger memories and organize associations, eventually manifesting in their physical lives and health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 17340*y - 10688 = 17507*y First, we want to get all the y's together. So, let's move the 17340*y to the other side of the equal sign by subtracting it from both sides. This gives us: -10688 = 17507*y - 17340*y Now, subtract the two y terms on the right side: -10688 = (17507 - 17340) * y Doing the subtraction, we get: -10688 = 167 * y Now, to find the value of y, we need to divide both sides by 167: y = -10688 / 167 After the division, we get: y = -64 So the answer is y = -64.

Synopsis: The year is 1942. World War II is raging, and the United States and Japan are at the forefront of the global conflict. At the center of the hostility is the Battle of Midway: a decisive moment that would change the tide of the entire war. \\"Allied Seas\\" tells the interconnected story of commanders, sailors, and intelligence officers from both sides as they race against time and the odds to both protect and conquer the crucial midway point in the Pacific Ocean. Our protagonists consist of a diverse group of individuals who each contribute uniquely to the battle. Admiral Nimitz, the American fleet commander; the young and ambitious Lieutenant Murphy, a pilot eager to prove himself; Captain Yamaguchi of the Japanese carrier Hiryu, and Lieutenant Yamamoto, an intellect who foresees the possible outcome of the coming battle, among others. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US Navy is clambering to respond to Japanese aggression. Intelligence Officer Edwin Layton, a close friend of Lieutenant Murphy, intercepts a crucial message that could turn the tide of the Pacific War. With the help of an American codebreaker, they discover that Japan is planning a major assault on Midway Atoll, a strategic point halfway between Asia and North America. Admiral Nimitz decides to launch a risky and daring counteroffensive, bringing together courageous soldiers from various backgrounds and ships for an unforgettable showdown. Lieutenant Murphy leads the Air Squadron in a deadly dance with the Japanese fighter pilots above the ocean, while Captain Yamaguchi must make the difficult decision to push forward despite the increasing odds of failure. Meanwhile, on the American mainland, the families of these soldiers, as well as their Japanese counterparts, are spotlighted as they navigate the challenges of living during wartime and the uncertainty of the fates of their loved ones. As the battle plays out, both sides experience tremendous losses and unexpected acts of heroism. The movie reaches its climax when Lieutenant Murphy, through a decisive move, manages to sink the Hiryu – Japan's last carrier – while Captain Yamaguchi makes the ultimate sacrifice for his country. In the end, the US emerges victoriously, putting an end to Japanese naval supremacy and shifting momentum in the Pacific War towards the Americans. The characters left standing must find ways to heal and move forward, carrying the weight of lives lost during the Battle of Midway. \\"Allied Seas\\" explores the human side of a historic conflict, showcasing bravery, sacrifice, and the bonds formed on both sides of the battlefield.

Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight? Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference. Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Answer:","completion":"Jimothy will likely finish his growth spurt after Dwight. This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided about the brothers' ages, their testosterone levels, and the stages of growth during puberty. Since Dwight is a junior in high school and Jimothy is a freshman, Dwight is older than Jimothy. As the paragraph indicates, growth during puberty is controlled by testosterone in boys. Additionally, growth in height is expected to remain rapid for several years and muscle development occurs toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Given that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, which is expected due to their age difference, it is reasonable to assume that Dwight is further along in his growth spurt than Jimothy. This would mean that, as the older brother, Dwight is likely to finish his growth spurt before Jimothy, who is still in the earlier stages of puberty and has not yet reached his peak growth rate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle.

Here is an article: Fusi Nchabeng, the provincial secretary for the women’s union, the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union, said the women did not know the video was made to protest integration, nor that, as they now believe, the food was urinated on. He declined to make the women available for an interview because the case is under criminal investigation, but he said they had worked at the residence for years and felt betrayed by the students and degraded by the video. As the video and postings about it spread to YouTube and Facebook, it has provoked ever more bitter racial division on the campus and soul-searching across the country. “It’s bigger than the university,” said Billyboy Ramahlele, who heads the university’s diversity office. “It’s bigger than the four students. It’s really a challenge of the project of nation-building and reconciliation we started in 1994.” That was the year white rule finally ended in South Africa. The University of the Free State has come a long way since the heyday of apartheid, when it was a training ground for the Afrikaner civil servants who became cogs in a racist political order. Like many South African institutions, the university has undergone a transformation that is sweeping, but still incomplete. A majority of the university’s 25,000 students are now black. They are taught in English as well as Afrikaans, the language of the Afrikaners. The hostels where students live, however, were still segregated after an earlier effort at integration ended in violence a decade ago. Then in January, after months of debate, the university moved again to integrate the residences, assigning black first-year students in white, Afrikaner hostels and whites in black residences. The white students generally did not take the spots allotted to them in the black residences, university officials said. Eight black first-year students were sent to live with 128 white male students at Reitz. “They seriously don’t want us here,” said Buzwe Tsawu, 19, an aspiring architect whose painterly self-portrait hangs on the wall. At 3 o’clock one morning in mid-January, the eight black students were awakened with a bang as firecrackers were tossed through the open windows of the four bedrooms of their bungalow, they said. In the weeks that followed, they said, their windows were repeatedly broken as they slept. One weekend, as the seniors gathered at the social club next door to drink and party and braai, as barbecuing is called in South Africa, the newcomers were subjected to verbal abuse. “They were trying to scare us, make us leave,” said Kulani Mngadi, 19. But the black students made a pact to stick it out. “We’re going to change this place,” said Ruddy Banyini, a 19-year-old who is studying bioinfomatics, using computer tools to search genetic databases. “We’ll prevent next year’s black first-years from feeling what we felt.” Many Afrikaners see what they call “forced integration” as a threat to the cultural identity of their embattled minority, descended from Dutch settlers. Symbols of the apartheid-era past are still to be found in the Afrikaner hostels. The Hendrik Verwoerd residence, named at its opening in 1968 for the assassinated architect of apartheid, was given a new name, Armentum, two years ago. Armentum is Latin for herd. A bust of Mr. Verwoerd, a white supremacist, remains in a meeting room, and his portrait and memorabilia line the walls of the senior social club. The hostel now has 18 blacks among its 160 residents, and its leader, Van Aardt Cloete, a 21-year-old senior, acknowledged the need to change the name because it “was sensitive for black people.” But he also said Armentum would keep a room in the hostel as a museum to showcase the Verwoerd past. Pieter Odendaal, a 23-year-old senior who is the head of Reitz house, said: “There’s a fear, especially among young white South Africans, that there isn’t a future in this land anymore, that there’s all this black empowerment. We don’t have anything to do with apartheid. Why must they take away our job opportunities? Why must we give up our language? People just want to hold onto the last thing we still have: our Afrikaans-speaking hostel, playing rugby, braaiing, listening to Afrikaans music.” The Reitz student video was made last year as the integration debate raged. “Once upon a time,” one student says in the opening frames, “the Boers had fun living on Reitz Island up until a day when the previously disadvantaged found the word ‘integration’ in the dictionary.” Frederick Fourie, the rector of the University of the Free State, heard about the video on Feb. 26 and watched it that morning. An Afrikaner whose father was a professor here, Mr. Fourie said he wept when he reached one scene. It showed a muscular white student starting a race of four hefty black cleaning women, set in slow motion to the theme music from “Chariots of Fire” — a scene Mr. Fourie felt humiliated good-hearted women who deserved better from students they had looked after. When he saw the urination scene, he knew he had a public relations disaster on his hands. The next day, he met with the tearful cleaning women. “My heart was sore,” he said. “They’d trusted these boys as their own sons. I apologized for what had happened to them at the university. I told them: ‘My heart is broken. I cry with you.’ ” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: On Campus, a Video Reminder of Apartheid’s Pain.

News article: Barack Obama's recent admission that he enjoyed skeet shooting at Camp David -- and the subsequent photo -- have been shot around the Internet. Now, Herobuilders, a Connecticut-based company, is gunning for some media attention by creating an action figure of the president shooting skeet. The 19.95 doll features the commander in chief wearing a sweatshirt with the words \\"clay pigeons\\" on it and is accessorized with a hunting shotgun. Although the head of the toy looks like Obama -- with a slightly more demented grin -- the muscle-bound arms seem to belong more to an 1980s-era action star like Dolph Lundgren than the comparatively skinny president. Herobuilders head honcho Emil Vicale admits that it's difficult to make an accurate body when you're trying to turn around a product before the Internet forgets it. \\"It's too complex and costly to make multiple bodies,\\" Vicale told The Huffington Post. \\"Most action figures use just one body.\\" The skeet shooting Obama is the fourth that Vicale has done honoring the president. Others include one with him dressed as the Joker from \\"The Dark Knight\\" and one with him holding a machine gun. Like the others, he expects the skeet shooting Obama to sell to both sides of the political spectrum. Vicale has made somewhat of a career out of capitalizing on politics and pop culture. He's made previous action figure tributes to \\"tanning mom\\" Patricia Krentcil, \\"The Rent Is Too Damn High\\" guy and the man who asked a cop, \\"Don't Taze Me Bro.\\" \\"We sold 1000 of 'The Rent Is Too Damn High Guy' in a month,\\" he told The Huffington Post back in May. While he expects the Obama skeet shooting doll to do well (\\"It's priced to sell,\\" he said), it probably won't do as well as his all-time best seller. \\"Sarah Palin was the biggest, but I don't think she'll ever sell that many again,\\" he said. ||||| HEROBUILDERS.com | Custom Action Figures | NY | BOSTON | 203-888-0147 | 24 hour Service e-mail sales@herobuilders.com Home | Custom Action Figures | Custom Plush | Bobble Heads | Reality TV Dolls | Custom Made Sneakers | Custom Candy Heads | Urban Crew Action Figures | Build A Buddy | Herobuilders News | Herobuilders Company Info | Herobuilders Links | Herobuilders Testimonials | Free Toys | Coupon Codes SKEET SHOOTING OBAMA ACTION FIGURE : Get them all !

Its parent company began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League (IRL) which was created by then Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George. In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series (formerly CART). The series is sanctioned by INDYCAR. - Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May, originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868, when the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, competing Union and Confederate holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end. - Michael \\"Mike\\" Lanigan is an entrepreneur and IndyCar Series team owner. - Buddy Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American racecar driver. He is best known for winning the 2004 Indianapolis 500 while driving for Rahal Letterman Racing, and the 2009 24 Hours of Daytona for Brumos Racing. - A suburb is a residential area or a mixed use area, either existing as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city. In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \\"suburb\\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \\"neighborhood\\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county. - Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing is an auto racing team that currently races in the United SportsCar Championship and the IndyCar Series. Based in Hilliard, Ohio, it is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former television talk show host David Letterman, and businessman Mike Lanigan. - Robert \\"Bobby\\" Woodward Rahal (born January 10, 1953 in Medina, Ohio) is an American auto racing driver and team owner. As a driver, he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 as a team owner for the winning driver, Buddy Rice. - The Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \\"Indy Car Racing\\". The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500. - The 70th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 31, 1986.

He was also formerly on the Board of Directors of both entities. He founded the Indy Racing League and co-owned Vision Racing. Many commentators, such as Gordon Kirby, suggest that George's actions at the head of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in creating the IRL to rival the then-dominant CART led to a sharp decline in popularity of open-wheel racing in the United States as it split the fanbase, and gave a significant boost to the national popularity of NASCAR. - Graham Robert Rahal ( born January 4 , 1989 ) is an American race car driver .

Given the below context: Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In a dystopian 1997, World War III is nearing an end, both the United States and the still existent Soviet Union suffered greatly in the conflict and both looking for a peace resolution. Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison in 1988 because of a nationwide crime increase of 400% in the United States due to a gas attack by the Soviets at the start of the war in which New York was worst hit. Surrounded by a 50-foot (15 m) containment wall, all inmates are sentenced to life imprisonment, and have formed gangs which control the crumbling, garbage-strewn city.Traveling to a three-way summit between the United States, the Soviet Union and China, Air Force One, the plane of the President of the United States, is hijacked by a sole member of a revolutionary organization opposed to the government; a women impersonating a stewardess (Nancy Stephens), who kills the pilots and takes control of the plane. The militant anarchist crashes the plane into Manhattan but the unnamed President (Donald Pleasence) is safely sealed in an escape pod and survives. The United States Police Force Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) arrives at the Liberty Island command center where he and the chief of security Remy (Tom Atkins) witness the crash. Hauk assembles a platoon of soldiers and they travel to the crash site in a fleet of helicopters. But when they arrive, they find the escape pod empty, indicating that the President has been taken hostage. An emissary of the inmates, named Romero (Frank Doubleday), appears and tells Hauk and the soldiers that they have the President and if they do not leave the island in 30 seconds, the President will be killed. Romero offers them one of the President's severed fingers as evidence. With no other choice, Hauk orders his men to return to the helicopters and they fly back to Liberty Island. In his office, Hauk meets with the arrived Secretary of State (Charles Cypress) who puts him in telephone contact with the Vice President where Hauk asks for authorization of a rescue...

To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The acting is wildly heavy-handed. The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. (3) Shots are frequently framed in off-balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner. The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the 1930's: a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The film's over-the-top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grim's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film. The film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy handed, and I found this (and the off-kilter camera angles) more irritating than humorous. The over-the-top acting, the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies/counter conspiracies, and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 minutes. That said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy-handed than light-hearted. But, the comedy may well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most camera time). Now, what is this review like? Choices: 1). negative; 2). positive;","completion":"This review is more like 1). negative because it talks about the movie's slow pacing, heavy-handed acting, and other elements that the reviewer finds irritating or not working well.

The competition is part of the Discovery Channel’s Shark Week lineup. We’ll let the network’s press release take it from here: They are one of the fastest and most efficient predators on the planet: Sharks. He is our greatest champion to ever get in the water: Michael Phelps. 39 world records. 23 Olympic golds. But he has one competition left to win. An event so monumental no one has ever attempted it before. The world’s most decorated athlete takes on the ocean’s most efficient predator: Phelps V Shark – the race is on! Produced by Peacock Productions. During a panel discussion in New York earlier this week, Phelps spoke about how much he liked sharks. “We just got off a plane from South Africa yesterday, we were down there for about a week,” he said. “That one was fun, doing some stuff with Shark Week and for me, sharks are like my no. 1 favorite animal in the world, being able to see them face to face was pretty cool.” The show airs on July 23rd. ||||| Twenty-three Olympic gold medals aren't going to protect you from a shark, Michael Phelps. As part of Discovery Channel's Shark Week, during its kick off on July 23, Phelps will apparently race a great white shark. It's not really clear how the two beasts of nature will spar off, but Vegas has probably already put down a betting line on the event. The Discovery Channel announced the stunt through a press release that gave us a little bit more info about “Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White,” but we want to know so much more. The release says: They are one of the fastest and most efficient predators on the planet: Sharks. He is our greatest champion to ever get in the water: Michael Phelps. 39 world records. 23 Olympic golds. But he has one competition left to win. An event so monumental no one has ever attempted it before. The world’s most decorated athlete takes on the ocean’s most efficient predator: Phelps V Shark – the race is on! But, how will the shark be kept from eating Michael? How will it know when to start? And maybe most importantly, how will they get a shark to know that it is supposed to be racing at all? Will this race be the final say in what species is best? Do sharks know that they have a whole week of celebration in the human world? There are so many questions. Anyway, Phelps shared his enthusiasm on Instagram, so at least he's one person who's excited about this risky stunt. I was able to do something that I had always wanted to do. Be in a cage and dive with great White sharks 🦈!! #bucketlist A post shared by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Jun 10, 2017 at 9:52pm PDT And if racing a great white wasn't enough, Phelps will be going back for seconds because having a lot of gold medals must make you really courageous. The Shark Week finale, “Shark School with Michael Phelps,” airing on July 30, will have Phelps swimming within two feet of a hammerhead shark. Sure, this is all a bit concerning to us. We just want what's best you for, Michael Phelps. But if racing sharks is what you want to do, then we're here to support your dreams. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The Discovery Channel's Shark Week lineup will feature a special event where 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps will race a great white shark.

William Henry \\"Lone Star\\" Dietz (August 17, 1884 - July 20, 1964) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Washington State University (1915-1917), Purdue University (1921), Louisiana Tech University (1922-1923), University of Wyoming (1924-1926), Haskell Institute--now Haskell Indian Nations University (1929-1932), and Albright College (1937-1942). From 1933 to 1934, Dietz was the head coach of the National Football League's Boston Redskins, where he tallied a mark of 11-11-2. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2012. Dietz's Indian heritage was first contested in 1916 after former neighbors who settled on the Pacific Coast heard he was posing as an Indian. In December 1918 the Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into his heritage after he fraudulently registered for the draft as a \\"Non-Citizen Indian\\" with an allotment. The Bureau found he had taken on the identity of James One Star, an Oglala man of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 12 years his senior who had disappeared in Cuba in 1894. Dietz also claimed he was the head of an American film company that produced propaganda films for the war. Dietz divorced De Cora in November 1918, charging her with abandonment. It is not clear how much she knew about his true identity. She died six days after his indictment. Dietz was tried in Spokane, Washington in June 1919 for the first offense.

Still, the judge instructed the jury to determine whether Dietz \\"believed\\" he was an Indian, not whether it was true.

Northwestern athletics dodged a bullet on Bryant McIntoshâs knee injury. But not Clayton Thorsonâs. Thorson got carted off Friday in the Music City Bowl after making a 24-yard catch on a trick play. He immediately grabbed his right knee as Nissan Stadium hushed and teammates approached to offer encouragement. After the game NU coach Pat Fitzgerald said that a preliminary exam revealed ânothing overly alarming â¦ I think he hyperextended it from my vantage point.â But subsequent tests revealed a tear and there is no timetable for his return. Surgery is expected in a few weeks. Torn ACLs typically have a 9- to 12-month recovery period. Thorson announced Dec. 19 that he would return to Evanston for his fifth season and fourth as a starter. Had he been healthy and entered the NFL draft he figured to be a late-round pick.

(Associated Press) HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — The American woman charged with subversion in Zimbabwe over allegedly insulting President Robert Mugabe on Twitter is set to be freed on bail. Martha O'Donovan on Thursday was ordered freed on 1,000 bail. The New Jersey native will return to court on Wednesday. O'Donovan is accused of calling the 93-year-old Mugabe a \\"sick man\\" in a tweet including an image of the president with a catheter. O'Donovan faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted for subversion. She also faces a charge of undermining the authority of or insulting the president, which carries up to a year in prison. O'Donovan has denied the charges as \\"baseless and malicious.\\" Hers was the first arrest since Mugabe last month appointed a cybersecurity minister, criticized by activists as targeting social media. ||||| Harare, Zimbabwe – A Zimbabwean High Court judge has granted bail to American journalist Martha O'Donovan who is facing charges of subversion and insulting President Robert Mugabe on social media. The ruling, which was made in her absence on Thursday afternoon, granted a 1,000 bail on the grounds that the state failed to exhibit the contents of the alleged tweets calling on people to protest against the government. Her lawyer Obey Shava of Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal NGO, told Al Jazeera he was pleased with the outcome. \\"I am very happy that justice has been done, I'm glad that my client has been vindicated because we have always argued that she was a perfect candidate for bail,\\" he said outside the court. {articleGUID} O'Donovan, employed as a programme associate of Magamba TV, an online channel that describes itself as Zimbabwe's leading creator of political satire, was arrested and taken into custody last week over allegations she published a tweet that described the 93-year-old president as a \\"goblin\\". Charges of attempting to overthrow a constitutionally elected government were later added to her docket and upheld by the courts. A subversion charge carries a 20-year prison sentence in the Southern African nation. Farai Munroe, a local comedian (also known as Comrade Fatso) and cofounder of Magamba TV told Al Jazeera that he was very pleased with the court's ruling. \\"We are all very ecstatic with the bail ruling, everyone at Magamba and everyone that has supported the process. \\"I think the judge showed the state lacked a strong case, lacked evidence and we are ecstatic that step one has been achieved in this struggle to free Martha and that is that she has got bail.\\" Munroe added: \\"We are hopeful and confident in going to the next step, that is her getting the charges dropped and getting her out of Chikurubi maximum security prison where she's been put over a couple of tweets.\\" 'Very hopeful' The 25-year-old journalist has spent at least three days in Chikurubi Prison, a maximum security facility on the outskirts of the capital that has gained notoriety among locals for its squalid conditions and frequent food shortages. However, according to David McGuire, the Public Affairs Officer of the US Embassy in Zimbabwe, representatives from the consular service have maintained \\"direct and daily contact\\" with O'Donovan. She is reportedly in good health. McGuire added that while he was unwilling to speculate on the overall outcome of the case, the US embassy was encouraged by the bail ruling and was hopeful of a positive result in the end. \\"The US Embassy is watching [this case] very closely, and we will stand by the process every step of the way, we are very hopeful for a positive outcome,\\" he said in a telephone interview. O'Donovan's arrest marks the first internet abuse case since the creation of a cybersecurity ministry in a cabinet reshuffle last month. The Mugabe government says the ministry is designed to monitor cybersecurity, detect possible threats and breaches of future laws governing social media use. O'Donovan is expected to report to the police on a bi-weekly basis and submit her travel documents to the clerk of court until the trial, which is set to continue later this month, is over.

For their study,he and his colleagues randomly divide 565 preschoolers into two groups.In one group,parents recorded notes about kids' normal TV viewing,without receiving any guidelines to reduce or change those habits.In the other group,researchers made visits and calls and sent monthly newsletters encouraging parents to replace violent TV with educational programming.After six and 12 months,parents reported their kid's angry,aggressive or anxious behaviors on a questionnaire.At both time points,children in the TV intervention program had slightly fewer problems than those in the comparison group.Boys in lowincome families seemed to benefit most from the change in programming,the researchers found. \\"The point is,this is something that is as effective as other things we do to try to guide behavior in children,and it's fairly simple,\\" Christakis said. Another study published in Pediatrics found the more TV kids and teens watched,the more likely they were to have a crime or other problems in society.Children may imitate violence they see--or more time in front of the TV could simply mean less communication with peers and families,and worse performance in school. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids watch no more than one to two hours of highquality programming each day.Researchers agreed parents should be mindful of what exactly their young kids are watching on TV as well.\\"It's not just about turning the TV off,it's about changing the channel,\\"...

Answer the following question: Here's a question: What could happen to guns if they are wet? Here are possible answers to this question: - misfire - explode - jam - break - take life I believe the correct choice is \\"misfire\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The possible consequences of guns getting wet are indeed numerous and can result in different outcomes, depending on the extent and nature of the contact with water. Here, we will discuss each of the given options in detail to understand their likelihood and the reasoning behind the correct choice, \\"misfire.\\" 1. Misfire: A misfire occurs when a firearm fails to discharge as intended, often due to issues within the ammunition or the gun's firing mechanism. When a gun gets wet, water may seep into the chamber and come in contact with the gun's primer or propellant. This can cause the primer to fail or the propellant to not ignite properly, leading to insufficient energy to propel the projectile. Misfires are the most common issue associated with damp or wet guns, making it the correct choice. 2. Explode: While it is theoretically possible for a wet gun to explode, the likelihood of this happening is relatively low. In general, an explosion would require a blockage, such as a bullet lodged in the barrel, along with subsequent rounds being fired. This buildup of pressure might cause the barrel or chamber to rupture. Although water could potentially contribute to barrel obstruction, it is more likely to cause a misfire or jam, reducing the chances of an explosion. 3. Jam: A jam refers to any failure in the cycling process of a firearm. This can be caused by several factors, such as the failure of spent casings to eject properly, a double-feed, or the failure of a new round to load correctly into the chamber. When a gun becomes wet, the water may interfere with the proper functioning of the internal components, such as the slide or bolt, which can lead to a jam. While jams aren't uncommon after exposure to water, they are typically less likely to occur than misfires. 4. Break: In general, modern firearms are built to withstand a certain amount of exposure to the elements, including water. However, long-term exposure to moisture can cause rust and corrosion, particularly in guns that are made of metal components. While this may eventually lead to a weakened firearm, it is not a likely immediate consequence of getting a gun wet. Proper cleaning and maintenance can mitigate the risk of a gun breaking due to water exposure. 5. Take life: This option seems to refer to the potential for a wet gun to accidentally discharge and harm someone. While any malfunction of a firearm may potentially result in unintended consequences, the risks posed by a wet gun are more likely to be misfires and jams, rather than an accidental discharge. In conclusion, while several consequences may arise when a gun gets wet, the most likely outcome is a misfire. However, it is essential for gun owners to properly maintain and store their firearms to minimize any risks associated with their use, including the risk of malfunction due to water exposure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But on Monday, as teens at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, returned from spring break, they took to Twitter to mock the clear backpacks now required by their school district, describing them as a violation of privacy, a meaningless gesture and a distraction from real gun reform. My new backpack is almost as transparent as the NRA’s agenda. I feel sooo safe now. As much as I appreciate the effort we as a country need to focus on the real issue instead of turning our schools into prisons. #clearbackpacks #MarchForOurLives pic.twitter.com/HqBIeGjzF9 — Lauren Hogg (@lauren_hoggs) April 2, 2018 “My new backpack is almost as transparent as the NRA's agenda,” wrote Lauren Hogg, a freshman at the school and a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 students and faculty members. “I feel sooo safe now,\\" wrote Lauren, the younger sister of David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas senior who has emerged as one of the leading student voices for gun control. \\"As much as I appreciate the effort we as a country need to focus on the real issue instead of turning our schools into prisons.” The backpacks, which were provided to students at no charge, are among the new security measures introduced by the Broward County school district in the shooting's aftermath. As students lined up between metal barricades to get those backpacks checked before heading through school doors, some said they felt overwhelmed by the new safety policies. “The see-through bags is a tad much, it’s an invasion of privacy,” Gabriel Edenbaum, 15, a freshman who survived the shooting, told NBC News on Tuesday. Despite all the changes on school grounds, he says he understands it’s to protect the students. When asked about the police force, Edenbaum said it can be “scary.” “We’re just trying to learn,” said Edenbaum. In a letter to students’ families last month,Robert Runcie, superindent of Broward County schools, said the district was considering installing metal detectors and using wands. Florida Highway Patrol officers will provide security at the high school, but each school in the district will have its own school resource officer by the start of the 2018-19 school year. New identification badges to be worn at all times, a greater police presence, continuously locked classroom doors: the list of safety initiatives from Runcie goes on and on. The new measures, Runcie said, are meant to help “fortify” the school and expand safety protocols. But many students were having none of it. “Starting off the last quarter of senior year right, with a good ol' violation of privacy!” one student, Delaney Tarr, said on Twitter. “Now I can’t lie about not having gum,” scoffed another. Some students used the see-through material of the backpacks to display protest signs and messages. \\"This bag contains everything politicians care about besides money,\\" read Lex Michael's sign in the pocket of an empty clear backpack. Another student, Sarah Chadwick, snapped a photo of the new backpacks with price tags attached and tweeted directly at Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — a nod to what she has previously characterized as students’ “worth” to the senator, who she calculated has received 3.3 million from the National Rifle Association, or 1.05 for each of Florida's estimated 3.1 million students. “Is that all we’re worth to these politicians?” Chadwick asked during a rally last month. Rubio has said that while he supports the students’ right to protest for what he described as \\"a gun ban,\\" he doesn’t agree with all their proposals. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Learn more ||||| “This backpack is probably worth more than my life.” So says a tweet from Carmen Lo, one of the many Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students who took to social media after transparent backpacks were handed out to the school’s 3,300 students on Monday. The backpacks are part of the new safety measures taking effect at the Parkland school, where 17 people were shot and killed and 17 others were wounded Feb. 14. On social media, particularly Twitter, many Stoneman Douglas students were showing off their backpack hacks, or the ways in which they’ve managed to personalize their new school bags. Many of the students used their new backpacks to make a statement, with the inference being that trying to reduce gun violence with transparent plastic backpacks was ridiculous, and for some, insulting. “Clear backpacks are stupid,” one student wrote on a sheet of paper he was displaying from the inside of his backpack. Others were attaching the 1.05 price tag used by some students to protest Florida Senator Marco Rubio. “When you take 3,140,167, the number of students enrolled in Florida schools, and divide it by 3,303,355, the amount of money Marco Rubio has received from the National Rifle Association, it comes out to 1.05,” studen Sarah Chadwick said in her speech at the March For Our Lives rally in Washington on March 24. Yet others pointed out that the new backpacks could bring unwanted attention to personal items. Other students saw some humor in the situation. Alex Wind, one of the #NeverAgain leaders, tweeted a clip of an amped-up Oprah Winfrey. It was an obvious reference to Oprah’s famous practice of giving away expensive stuff to audience members on her daytime talk show. Yet another student drew a pair of crying eyes with “Prisoner #0612074413” written in red and blue marker on the backpack. That number isn’t random, though. It’s actually her student number. Another enterprising student used his to advertise the fact he’s on the market. “I AM SINGLE,” a sheet of paper inside the backpack reads. All caps, of course. And Jaclyn Corin, another prominent student-activist, affixed March For Our Lives-related pins to hers. “Thousands of clear backpacks were donated to MSD...it’s a shame b/c they should’ve been given to a school that actually needs the supplies. But since we’re stuck with them, I decided to make the most out of the situation & decorate!!” she tweeted. In response, Stoneman Douglas principal Ty Thompson tweeted, “Thanks for embracing it Jackie. We will adjust as needed moving forward.” Here is a look what other students and observers were saying on Twitter: What do you think about the effectiveness of clear backpacks?

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal...

Q:Question: Going into a trance is often associated with what sort of unconscious involuntary movement at night? Options: - hungry - peacefulness - religious experience - loss of balance - sleepwalking Explain why a human would choose \\"sleepwalking\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"sleepwalking\\" to answer the question above because it is the most relevant option in relation to going into a trance and unconscious involuntary movement at night. Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a behavior disorder that occurs during deep sleep, resulting in episodes where a person performs activities while being asleep and unconscious. The person is often not aware of their actions, and they usually have no memory of the event when they wake up. The other options provided are not related to unconscious involuntary movements at night: 1. Hungry: This refers to the feeling of needing or wanting food, which has no direct connection to trance-like states or involuntary movements at night. 2. Peacefulness: This refers to a state of calmness or tranquility, which can be experienced at night but does not signify any unconscious involuntary movement. 3. Religious experience: A religious experience may evoke feelings of trance, but it does not specifically relate to unconscious involuntary movement at night. 4. Loss of balance: Although losing balance can occur at night, it is not directly associated with going into a trance or any unconscious involuntary movement. In conclusion, sleepwalking is the most appropriate answer to the question, as it pertains to a trance-like state and unconscious involuntary movements at night, while the other options do not directly relate to this phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Translating Henry James for the Screen Onata Aprile and Alexander Skarsgard in the coming âWhat Maisie Knew.â When Henry James’s novel “What Maisie Knew” was published in 1897, the movies were in their infancy — the brothers Lumière had exhibited their first motion pictures just two years earlier — and there’s no evidence that in the 19 years of life that remained to James he ever cared a jot for the new medium; it wouldn’t have met his standards. The movies have since avenged that slight in a way that seems at least arguably Jamesian: They have paid his work the ambiguous tribute of their attention. Dozens of adaptations of his difficult, delicate fictions have been produced since his death, all trying (and most failing) to capture something of his essence, the elusive beast in the verbal jungle. Alison Elliott, left, with Helena Bonham Carter in âThe Wings of the Doveâ (1997). The latest filmmakers to venture into the murk and tangle of James’s world are Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose version of “What Maisie Knew” opens on Friday. “Maisie” isn’t among the most obviously daunting works in the canon. It’s relatively short and the plot, such as it is, seems straightforward: the drama revolves around the shifting affections of bright little Maisie (Onata Aprile), as she is passed back and forth among her divorced parents (Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan) and other grown-ups, all of whom claim to have her best interests at heart. The trick, of course, is figuring out which, if any, of them actually do; it’s a lot to ask of a child. Like most of James’s best fiction, “What Maisie Knew” is about the subtle workings of power, of influence — of sway; as always in his work, the machinations are terrifying. Mr. McGehee and Mr. Siegel have decided, bravely, to do away with a good deal of what makes James’s worldview so distinctively dark: they have updated the story to the present day, eliminated one of the novel’s most important characters (the moralistic governess Mrs. Wix) and, while respecting the complexities of their young heroine’s predicament, drastically reduced the general ominousness of the original’s tone. This must be the sunniest Henry James movie ever made. Purists may squawk, and they’d have a point, but James is so movie-resistant anyway that it hardly seems worth the effort to be outraged. The movie doesn’t “get” him because he can’t be gotten, really, in any medium other than the one in which he so meticulously labored. Practically every filmmaker who has set out in search of James has ended up somewhere else, either by design (like Mr. McGehee and Mr. Siegel) or by inadvertence, lost among the tendrils of the writer’s lush consciousness. The more closely a film tries to follow him, it seems, the farther afield it goes. Those who have stuck most faithfully to the plots of his novels, like the Merchant Ivory team in “The Europeans” (1979), “The Bostonians” (1984) and “The Golden Bowl” (2000), or the gentlefolk of the BBC — who have recently bundled a few of their earnest attempts in a DVD set called “The Henry James Collection” — have tended to bring forth dramas without drama, because the action in James rarely matters much. Everything that counts is under the surface, in the tortured, painfully refined minds of his characters, and James wasn’t, for all his gifts, very good at inventing situations that could show an audience, rather than tell it, what lay beneath his people’s apparently banal words and gestures. He was a notoriously unsuccessful playwright. Showing instead of telling is what movies are supposed to do, and you have to wonder what possesses a filmmaker who turns the last page of, say, “The Portrait of a Lady” or “The Wings of the Dove” and thinks it would make a hell of a picture. Even the most intelligent attempts to be wholly faithful to his stories and his characters — films like Peter Bogdanovich’s “Daisy Miller” (1974), Jane Campion’s “Portrait of a Lady” (1996) and Agnieszka Holland’s “Washington Square” (1997) — seem finally to bump up against something stubborn and unyielding in the material. In the absence of strong, clearly defined dramatic action James’s leisurely plots can feel frustratingly irresolute, and the characters’ many scruples and hesitancies, so evocative on the page, can become downright puzzling on the screen. Moviegoers aren’t noted for their patience. What’s fascinating about James adaptations is how starkly they draw the aesthetic battle lines between the narrative arts of literature and film. In the writer’s own lifetime, the contest was unequal, but, as he knew, the balance of power in any relationship can shift — often subtly, almost unnoticeably — in the course of time, and the movies’ sway over the imagination of the public has increased exponentially in the century or so since their obscure birth. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the actress who plays Maisie in Scott McGehee and David Siegelâs version of âWhat Maisie Knew.â She is Onata Aprile, not Joanna Vanderham, who plays Margo, a nanny.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Indon push for extra-marital sex crime When legal academics and child rights advocates gathered at Indonesia's Constitutional Court this week in a bid to criminalise sex outside of the marital bed, the words \\"lust\\", \\"urges\\", \\"God\\" and \\"America\\" were never far from their lips. Showing a photograph of gay rights supporters in front of the US Supreme Court building and then an image of people at a LGBT pride rally, University of Indonesia law lecturer Hamid Chalid was adamant. \\"This is what happened in America ... Is this what we want? Our hopes rest on the Constitutional Court.\\" Mr Chalid is one of a number of people involved in the constitutional court challenge seeking amendments to laws on adultery, rape and sex with a minor under Indonesia's criminal code. They are calling for the criminalisation of extra-marital sex - including same-sex. - saying \\"religious values must be reinstated as society's living principle\\". Extra-marital sex should carry punishments of up to nine months jail, while the maximum sentence for same-sex intercourse should be five years, they argue. Mr Chalid told a court hearing in Jakarta this week that the purpose of the change was to \\"reignite\\" the highest level of human consciousness - \\"godliness\\" - and prevent the country from shifting with the winds of \\"lust\\". In America he said the desire to become \\"more liberal\\" had resulted in no boundaries. \\"In two years, in three years, in five years ... will there be a decision from US Supreme Court that marriage between father and his daughter or between son and his mother are legal?\\" he told the court. For a group of women who had travelled via bus from Bandung in West Java to Jakarta for the hearing, these fears are real. Wearing matching hijabs and outfits, the women echoed out calls of \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is Great\\") when Asrorun Ni'am Sholeh, Chairman of the Indonesian Children Protection Commission said the only proper way to channel \\"sexual urges\\" was through marriage. Mr Sholeh told the court extra-marital sex must be prohibited as it was a violation against children's basic rights - burdening them \\"socially and psychologically\\". \\"Children born from extra-marital sexual intercourse are prone to violence, abandonment and negligence,\\" he stated, sparking calls of \\"Astaghfirullah\\" (\\"May God Forgive\\") from the women. Sex within the LGBT community was also seen as a moral danger in need of clamping down. \\"Lewd\\" same-sex acts had the tendency to lead to \\"addiction\\", Mr Sholeh warned with children most at risk of their \\"deception\\". Judging by the reception of those on the bench at the Constitutional Court, those launching the legal action have some chance of success. During the hearing Judge Patrialis Akbar said Indonesia's perspective on human rights was different to that of the United Nations (UN). \\"Human rights freedom in our country has limitation. First, it's limited that it can't violate other's human rights. That's the basic principle. Secondly, our freedom is also limited by moral values and also limited by religious values,\\" he added. Founder of the Indonesian LGBT rights group GAYa Nusantara and academic Dr Dede Oetomo said it appeared the court was becoming more conservative. \\"They cannot differentiate which one is positive law principle and which one is religious principle.\\" Dr Oetomo is worried the community, courts and politicians were playing it safe, with those holding secular views hesitant to challenge religious feelings out of fear they will be labelled blasphemous. The court challenge comes off the back of what Human Rights Watch labelled an \\"unprecedented attack\\" on LGBT rights this year. House of Representatives member Reni Marlinawati said same-sex relationships violated \\"religious norms\\" while Defence Minister Ryamizad Ryacudu compared it to a \\"proxy war\\" more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. Activists have criticised the silence from President Joko Widodo's government as an indication of their unwillingness to stand up against these conservative forces. Dr Oetomo believes fears around sexuality in Indonesia stemmed from a lack of education in school. A challenge made even more difficult by the appointment of Muhajir Effendi as Education Minister in the recent cabinet reshuffle, he said. Mr Effendi is from Muhammadiyah, one of Indonesia's largest Islamic organisations, and the rector of one of their universities. \\"It will certainly be prohibited to have sexual education. It's like we're doomed,\\" Dr Oetomo said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process: - Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less force is exerted happens, how will it affect the crust will take longer to break. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, both direct and indirect. In the perturbation hypothesis, when less force is exerted between the Earth's plates, it results in a slower plate movement and consequently, a delay in crust-breaking events. This change in force will directly affect the process of plate tectonics and the occurrence of earthquakes. Direct effects: 1. The reduced force between plates may take more time for the stress to build up in the Earth's crust to a point where it can cause the crust to break. Therefore, the frequency of earthquakes might be reduced. 2. The amount of stress released during the breaking of the crust may be lower, leading to less powerful earthquakes. This, in turn, may result in a smaller magnitude of seismic waves, causing less damage to the surface. Indirect effects: 1. The slower movement of plates and reduced force may contribute to alterations in the Earth's landscape, as the tectonic activities, such as mountain building and the formation of trenches, might take longer to occur. 2. The reduced frequency and intensity of earthquakes may also impact various other factors in the Earth's system, such as volcanic activities, which are related to the movement of tectonic plates. 3. The decreased intensity of earthquakes may indirectly affect the preparedness and response efforts of communities to such natural disasters. People may become less concerned about the risks of earthquakes, which could result in less stringent building codes, infrastructure, and emergency protocols. In summary, the proposed perturbation of exerting less force on the Earth's plates will directly affect the process of crust breaking and indirectly impact various other geological processes, landscape formations, earthquake-related threats, and human preparedness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What is required for interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair? A: A:","completion":"For the interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair, the process of breaking and reforming bonds is required. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms in space. They can be categorized into two main types: structural isomers and stereoisomers. Structural isomers, also known as constitutional isomers, have a different connectivity of atoms within the molecule. The interconversion process between structural isomers needs a complete breaking and reforming of bonds to rearrange the atoms within the molecule. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, are molecules with the same connectivity of atoms but with a different spatial arrangement. Stereoisomers can be further classified into two types: geometric isomers and optical isomers. 1. Geometric isomers (also called cis-trans or E/Z isomers) occur in molecules with a double bond or other restricted rotation elements hindering free rotation around the bond. For the interconversion between these geometric isomers, breaking the double bond and reforming it with a different spatial alignment is required. 2. Optical isomers (also called enantiomers or chiral isomers) are molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other, similar to a pair of hands. The interconversion between optical isomers requires the breaking and reforming of bonds around the chiral center—an atom around which the substituents are arranged in such a way that the resulting molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image. In both cases, the breaking and reforming of bonds involve the absorption, release, or redistribution of energy in the molecular system. This energy can be introduced through various means such as heat, light, or a chemical reaction with an external reagent. Interconversion may also involve passing through an intermediate state or transition state, which may result in the formation of other species before the final product. In summary, the interconversion between the two forms of an isomeric pair requires the breaking and reforming of bonds within the molecule, with the process often involving the absorption or release of energy and potentially passing through intermediate or transition states. This rearrangement leads to different spatial configurations of atoms, giving rise to the distinct properties and behaviors exhibited by the isomers."},{"prompt":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Hoya XO via Ace Review: This listing is for a Hoya MC (multi-coated) filter.

Plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. Many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host (Figure 24.25). In addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. Fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. For example, the fungus Claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). Although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance. In animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. The most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. The active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug LSD. Smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops.

Here's another in a long, line of Presley vehicles that combines a juvenile plot, silly acting, and endless three chord songs with inane lyrics. This guy's acting was worse than his singing---and that's saying something. The most conspicuous thing about the movie is the amount of grease is Presley's hair and the repetitiveness of his monosyllabic dialogue. He was a real cornball with a gnat's IQ and no talent. Truly, do his idol-worshipping fans realize that Presley's IQ was under 80?

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

In a study published online Feb. 20 in PLOS One, Cornell biomedical engineers and Weill Cornell Medical College physicians described how 3-D printing and injectable gels made of living cells can fashion ears that are practically identical to a human ear. Over a three-month period, these flexible ears grew cartilage to replace the collagen that was used to mold them. \\"This is such a win-win for both medicine and basic science, demonstrating what we can achieve when we work together,\\" said co-lead author Lawrence Bonassar, associate professor of biomedical engineering. The novel ear may be the solution reconstructive surgeons have long wished for to help children born with ear deformity, said co-lead author Dr. Jason Spector, director of the Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery and associate professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell. \\"A bioengineered ear replacement like this would also help individuals who have lost part or all of their external ear in an accident or from cancer,\\" Spector said. Replacement ears are usually constructed with materials that have a Styrofoam-like consistency, or sometimes, surgeons build ears from a patient's harvested rib. This option is challenging and painful for children, and the ears rarely look completely natural or perform well, Spector said. To make the ears, Bonassar and colleagues started with a digitized 3-D image of a human subject's ear and converted the image into a digitized \\"solid\\" ear using a 3-D printer to assemble a mold. They injected the mold with collagen derived from rat tails, and then added 250 million cartilage cells from the ears of cows. This Cornell-developed, high-density gel is similar to the consistency of Jell-O when the mold is removed. The collagen served as a scaffold upon which cartilage could grow. The process is also fast, Bonassar added: \\"It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later. We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted.\\" The incidence of microtia, which is when the external ear is not fully developed, varies from almost 1 to more than 4 per 10,000 births each year. Many children born with microtia have an intact inner ear, but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure. Bonassar and Spector have been collaborating on bioengineered human replacement parts since 2007. Bonassar has also worked with Weill Cornell neurological surgeon Dr. Roger Härtl on bioengineered disc replacements using some of the same techniques demonstrated in the PLOS One study. The researchers specifically work on replacement human structures that are primarily made of cartilage -- joints, trachea, spine, nose -- because cartilage does not need to be vascularized with a blood supply in order to survive. They are now looking at ways to expand populations of human ear cartilage cells in the laboratory so that these cells can be used in the mold, instead of cow cartilage. \\"Using human cells, specifically those from the same patient, would reduce any possibility of rejection,\\" Spector said. He added that the best time to implant a bioengineered ear on a child would be when they are about 5 or 6 years old. At that age, ears are 80 percent of their adult size. If all future safety and efficacy tests work out, it might be possible to try the first human implant of a Cornell bioengineered ear in as little as three years, Spector said. ||||| WEDNESDAY, Feb. 20 (HealthDay News) -- The emerging field of 3-D printing is able to now create artificial human ears that look and act like real ears, researchers say. The artificial ears could give hope to children born with ear deformities or people who have lost all or part of their ear in an accident or from cancer, said the Cornell University team. Currently, many artificial ears are made with materials that have a Styrofoam-like feeling. Or surgeons can build ears from a patient's rib, but this is challenging and painful for children and the ears rarely look completely natural or perform well, according to the study authors. The new process begins with a digitized 3-D image of a patient's ear, which is turned into a mold using a 3-D printer. A special gel that contains collagen is injected into the mold. The collagen serves as a scaffold upon which cartilage can grow. The process is fast, according to co-lead author Lawrence Bonassar, an associate professor of biomedical engineering. \\"It takes half a day to design the mold, a day or so to print it, 30 minutes to inject the gel, and we can remove the ear 15 minutes later. We trim the ear and then let it culture for several days in nourishing cell culture media before it is implanted,\\" he explained in a university news release. The artificial ears are practically identical to natural ears, according to the researchers. Children born with a rare deformity called microtia -- poorly developed outer ears -- may be key beneficiaries of the new technology. Microtia occurs in anywhere from one to four in every 10,000 births, the researchers noted. These children have an intact inner ear but they suffer hearing loss due to an insufficient outer ear. Study co-author Dr. Jason Spector, director of the Laboratory for Bioregenerative Medicine and Surgery and associate professor of plastic surgery at Weill Cornell in New York City, said the best time to implant a bioengineered ear would be around the age of 5 or 6, because the human ear is already at 80 percent of its adult size by then. The study was published online Feb. 20 in the journal PLoS One. If tests go well and prove the safety and effectiveness of the prosthetic, the first human implant of this new type of artificial ear could take place in as soon as three years, the Cornell team said.

What senior British Army officer known for his \\"scorched earth policy\\" experienced success in the British effort to re-conquer the sudan?","completion":"The senior British Army officer known for his \\"scorched earth policy\\" and success in the British effort to re-conquer the Sudan was Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, First Earl Kitchener of Khartoum. Born on June 24, 1850, in County Kerry, Ireland, Kitchener served as a prominent figure in British military history, particularly during the Sudan Campaign and later in World War I. Kitchener demonstrated his military prowess during the reconquest of Sudan in the late 19th century, spanning from 1896 to 1898. Serving as the Sirdar, or commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Army, he successfully led the Anglo-Egyptian forces against the Mahdist State. Utilizing the scorched earth policy, Kitchener’s forces systematically destroyed resources, infrastructure, and crops needed to support enemy forces in a region. The high point of Kitchener's campaign came during the Battle of Omdurman on September 2, 1898. In this decisive battle, Kitchener's army crushed the remaining Mahdist forces, effectively ending the Mahdist State and re-establishing British and Egyptian control over Sudan. Kitchener's victory was significant not only for its strategic implications, but also for his effective use of modern military technologies and tactics, which played a crucial role in turning the tide of battle in favor of his forces. Following his successes in Sudan, Kitchener went on to serve in various prominent positions within the British Army, including the Boer War in South Africa and World War I. He held the title of Secretary of State for War during the early years of World War I and was known for his steadfast efforts to create and manage a vastly expanded British fighting force. Tragically, Kitchener died on June 5, 1916, when the ship he was aboard, HMS Hampshire, struck a mine and sank off the Orkney Islands."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the leader who brought Armenians with the Mongols who returned to Jerusalem? ? Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What genre ended when plays were banned?\\" is in \\"The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in Greek and Roman theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The genre that ended when plays were banned is medieval religious drama. This genre of drama primarily consisted of plays that depicted stories and themes from the Bible and focused on the religious teachings and morals of the Catholic Church during the medieval period. The decline and eventual demise of medieval religious drama can be attributed to several factors, including the weakening influence of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation, and bans on religious plays implemented in various countries. From the 16th century, events such as the Protestant Reformation and the shifting religious landscape in Europe resulted in an increasingly fragmented and secularized society. As a result, playwrights and theatrical producers began to focus on secular subjects and themes that were more reflective of contemporary society. In England, Elizabeth I banned all religious plays in 1558, and by the 1580s, the great cycle plays, which were significant religious dramas revolving around the biblical narrative, had been silenced. In the Netherlands, religious plays were banned in 1539, followed by similar bans by the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. These bans essentially dismantled the international theatre framework that had previously been centered around religious stories and themes and paved the way for each country to develop its own distinct form of drama that was disconnected from medieval religious drama. This shift led to a renewed focus on and interest in Greek and Roman theatre, resulting in a diverse range of secular and classical-inspired drama that would shape the European theatre in the centuries that followed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Annie Dillard believes that Options: A. not enough information B. Everyday is important C. Life does not matter D. Days are inconsequential === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"B. Everyday is important"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Barack Obama Monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation's economy, a plan the campaign of his likely Republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes. Sen. Barack Obama wants to spend 60 billion on America's infrastructure. During an economic speech in Flint, Michigan, Obama promised to spend billions to improve America's education, infrastructure, energy and health care systems. To improve America's competitiveness, the senator from Illinois said he wants to spend 10 billion on childhood education, 150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and 60 billion over 10 years to build \\"21st century infrastructure.\\" During his speech in","completion":"Flint, Michigan, Obama emphasized the importance of investing in the country's future and building a strong foundation for economic growth and stability. He argued that these investments would create millions of well-paying jobs, reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, and provide a higher quality of life for all Americans. The presidential candidate also touched upon the need for innovation in the healthcare sector, proposing a 50 billion investment in fully implementing electronic health records and modernizing medical practices to reduce errors and improve patient care. Additionally, he called for the expansion of broadband access across rural areas to bridge the digital divide and boost local economies. To finance these ambitious initiatives, Obama outlined a plan to end tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs overseas, close corporate tax loopholes, and roll back the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. He emphasized that this would ensure that the financial burden is shared fairly and effectively between the different income classes in the United States. Despite the criticism from his Republican opponents, who argued that increasing taxes would hinder economic growth, Obama contended that his approach would ultimately promote long-term economic prosperity through targeted investments in critical sectors of the American economy. He expressed confidence that these measures would establish a solid foundation for a more resilient and prosperous America in the face of global challenges and uncertainties. In conclusion, during his speech in Flint, Michigan, then-Senator Barack Obama laid out a comprehensive plan to revitalize the nation's economy through strategic investments in education, infrastructure, energy, and healthcare. He maintained that this plan would create jobs, enhance national competitiveness, and ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities for all Americans. Critics, however, argued that the associated tax hikes would have adverse effects on economic growth. Nevertheless, Obama remained optimistic about the potential for his plan to foster sustainable and inclusive growth in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

MALS was formed here more than 30 years ago. Today, 14 staff attorneys, 26 office workers and 21 University of Memphis third- year law students work out of rented offices in the old Claridge Hotel building at 109 N. Main. Offices are spartan. There are no lush rugs or stylish furniture. The large table in the conference room is simple varnished wood. Offices are small and mostly plain, except for the eclectic mix of pop art, African statuary and neon that adorns litigation director Webb Brewer's space. Brewer, who has been at the agency 20 years, said there is a need for lawyers of all stripes to help with the problems of the poor. \\"The private bar could meet more of the need through pro bono work, but there are still cases that involve the systemic problems for low-income people that we would need to do,\\" said Brewer. \\"The legal system marketplace just doesn't serve low-income people too well, except in fee-generat-ing type cases,\\" Brewer said. \\"If a poor person gets run over by a bus, an attorney might take that case because they might be able to recover part of the damage award as attorney fees.

Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences. These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public. Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative. A book with pictures with no captions that tell a story are called what?","completion":"A book with pictures and no captions that tell a story is called a wordless novel. Wordless novels rely on a series of captionless images, which are often intricately designed and artistically rendered, to convey a narrative without the use of text. They challenge readers to interpret the story through visual cues and context clues, inviting them to explore and dive deep into the creator's imagination. Wordless novels can be considered a form of comics since they share the elements of sequential art and storytelling, even though they lack the traditional written dialogue or captions typically associated with comics. The storytelling is entirely accomplished through the progression of images that help the readers understand the characters, settings, emotions, and plot development. Some examples of wordless novels include \\"The Arrival\\" by Shaun Tan, \\"The Snowman\\" by Raymond Briggs, and \\"A Boy, a Dog, and a Frog\\" by Mercer Mayer. These books explore various themes and subjects, with artists pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling through their art. In contrast, storyboards are a series of images used primarily as a guide for film sequences, particularly in the field of animation. While they also present a story through sequential images, their main purpose is to serve as a blueprint for filmmakers to visualize and plan their shots and scenes rather than an end product for public consumption. As a result, while they share some similarities with wordless novels, their intended purpose and audience are quite different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well! The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances. A special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story... The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there \\"prophecy\\" and the humans need someone to stop them. One girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.

Experts say there could be an influx of these barrel jellyfish – up to 3ft 2in in diameter – over the next few months due to warmer weather.

Above, wildlife photographer Steve Trewhella poses with the enormous creature, measuring 3ft in diameter. Richard Harrington of the Marine. Conservation Society said: ‘Although this species is harmless … we still. advise the public not to touch them.’ It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on the island by dog walker Suzanne Sheldon. Following her discovery, Ms Sheldon, 47, said: 'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I had ever seen.' Experts have warned that there could be an influx of the sea creatures as the weather warms up.

In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the South Coast. High numbers: In recent weeks, up to 10 barrel jellyfish have been spotted washed up on beaches around the south coast. Left, the jellyfish spotted by Mr Trewhella and, right, local Julie Hatcher poses with another jellyfish. Mr Harrington added: 'This is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but we still advise the public not to touch them.' But Mr Trewhella believes the creatures have come ashore because of strong winds and high tides. 'It's not that unusual to see jellyfish, they aren't particularly common in Dorset but we do see them every once in a while,' said the photographer. 'Jellyfish are a form of plankton, and the warm weather means we might see an increase in the levels of plankton. Another finding: It comes just days after a jellyfish the size of a dustbin lid was sighted on a beach in Portland. 'This is something that occurs around this time every year and it is known as the plankton boom. 'However, it is not the warm weather that causes jellyfish to wash up, instead it's the wind and tides that leave them stranded on beaches. 'I think we will see more strandings because of the on-shore winds and the tides, but people should be careful not to touch them.' 'Very bulky': Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was 'at least three foot in width' Barrel jellyfish - Rhizostoma pulmo in Latin - are often known as dustbin-lid jellyfish because of their enormous size. They are commonly found in the north east Atlantic, Adriatic, and Mediterranean sea and are prey to leatherback turtles. Experts have warned that some of the jellyfish can sting and anyone affected should seek medical attention.","completion":"A giant jellyfish, as big as a dustbin lid, appeared on a beach in Portland, Dorset. It is called a barrel jellyfish and usually lives in the Atlantic or the Mediterranean Sea. It is a big, round jellyfish that is nearly 3 feet wide. Even though it looks scary, it is harmless and won't hurt people. But it is still a good idea not to touch it. It showed up on the beach because of strong winds and high tides. As the weather gets warmer, more of these jellyfish might appear on the beach, but we should always be careful not to touch them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sparks are an American pop and rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1972 by brothers Ron (keyboards) and Russell Mael (vocals). The duo formed in 1968 under the name Halfnelson. Known for their quirky approach to songwriting, Sparks' music is often accompanied by intelligent, sophisticated, and acerbic lyrics, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified in the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. They are also noted for Russell Mael's distinctive falsetto voice and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style. Brothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in western Los Angeles County, California, during the \\"Golden Age\\" of the LA club scene, with the Doors, Love and the Standells regularly playing the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys playing the afternoon event Teenage Fair. Both Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art, Russell theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered \\"cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that\\", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as \\"Anglophiles\\". Forming Halfnelson in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their eponymous debut album - with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey's brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing - sold poorly, but after switching labels to Warner Bros. Records and renaming themselves Sparks, a play on the Marx Brothers, the re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit \\"Wonder Girl\\". Their follow-up album, A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following. An appearance on the BBC Television's The Old Grey Whistle Test led to wider interest where host Bob Harris compared the band to a cross between Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and the Monkees.

To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown. During the debate over the establishment clause, Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts took issue with Madison's language regarding whether the government was a national or federal government (in which the states retained their individual sovereignty), which Baker suggests compelled Madison to withdraw his language from the debate.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Why was the language included?\\" lies in the efforts to appease the Anti-Federalists during the debate over the establishment clause. Initially, James Madison proposed language stating that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\". However, this was considered a cause for alarm by both Anti-Federalists and Federalists due to their experience under the British crown, as the word \\"national\\" evoked concerns about the potential centralization of power. To address these concerns, the House rejected Madison's initial language and replaced it with a more general term, \\"religion\\". This change was intended to mitigate fears and reach a compromise between the two opposing factions during the constitutional debates. Massachusetts Representative Elbridge Gerry's criticism towards Madison's language played a significant role in this situation, as it questioned whether the government being proposed was a national or a federal one, in which states would retain their individual sovereignty. Thus, the language was included to strike a balance between the Federalists' desire for a strong central government and the Anti-Federalists' concerns about protecting state sovereignty and individual liberties. This compromise allowed for the passage of the establishment clause and the creation of a government that respected the boundaries between national power and religious freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The Red Sea is parting again, but this time no one can help. Satellite pictures show that the Arabian plate and the African plate are moving away from each other, stretching the Earth's crust and widening the southern end of the Red Sea. Last September, series of earthquakes started splitting the planet's surface in Ethiopia. Over a period of three weeks, the sides on the rift separated by 26 feet. \\"We think that the crust is melted slowly at depths greater than 10 kilometers, where it is hotter, forming molten rock,\\" said Tim J Wright. \\"This molten rock rises through the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock.\\" The molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers. Wright explained, \\"Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust.\\" The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. \\"The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before,\\" Wright said. \\"On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year.\\" This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea. Although such processes could take millions of years to occur, this event has given scientists an opportunity to examine the break in real time. Question: The passage is mainly about _ .

Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Ability to find things in filtered data","completion":"The ability to find things in filtered data allows users to efficiently locate specific information or patterns within a large dataset. By applying various filters, it becomes easier to sort through data and identify trends, outliers, or areas of interest. This skill is particularly useful in fields such as data analysis, business intelligence, and research. To achieve this, one can use different types of filters such as text-based or numerical filters, or even a combination of both. These filters can be applied using tools like spreadsheets or more advanced data analysis software, depending on the complexity of the data. Text-based filters help filter data based on keywords, phrases, or patterns within the text fields. For instance, filtering customer feedback based on keywords like \\"excellent\\" or \\"poor\\" can provide insights into overall customer satisfaction. Numerical filters, on the other hand, allow users to filter data based on specific numbers or ranges. In a sales report, numerical filters can be used to find products with sales figures above or below a certain threshold. Another effective way to find things in filtered data is by using conditional filters. These filters evaluate data based on one or more conditions and help identify data that meets specific criteria. For example, a conditional filter can be employed to extract information about customers who live in a specific region and whose purchase totals exceed a certain value. Using advanced data analysis tools like SQL or data visualization software can further enhance the ability to find things in filtered data. SQL queries, for instance, can be used to filter, sort, and aggregate data from databases, making it easier to discover patterns or trends. Visualization tools, such as bar graphs, scatter plots, or heat maps, can provide a visual representation of filtered data, which makes spotting patterns or anomalies much simpler. In conclusion, the ability to find things in filtered data is of great importance in today's data-driven world. By applying various filters, users can narrow down the scope of data, making it easier to analyze and gain valuable insights. Combining numerical, textual, and conditional filters with advanced data analysis tools and visualization techniques can significantly improve the efficiency of data analysis and decision-making processes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For the second consecutive week, the game began with a touchdown on the Patriots' first series: this time, Brady hit Watson for a 7-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. On the first play of the ensuing Chargers possession, their first, linebacker Rosevelt Colvin intercepted a Philip Rivers pass, but it did not translate into points for the Patriots as Gostkowski then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the Patriots' resulting series. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots capped off a 10-play, 75-yard drive with a 23-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 14-0. Colvin then added a sack and forced fumble to his game statistics, as he strip-sacked Rivers after the Chargers reached the Patriots' 34-yard line and defensive lineman Vince Wilfork recovered the fumble for the Patriots' second forced turnover of the game. On the Patriots' next drive, which spanned into the second quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by linebacker Shawne Merriman at the Chargers' 29-yard line, but Brady recovered his own fumble to retain possession for the Patriots. Six plays later, a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 17-0. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots were pushed back to their 10-yard line after another Merriman sack of Brady. The Patriots would punt back to the Chargers, but on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots' 37-yard line, Rivers was intercepted by linebacker Adalius Thomas, who returned it 65&#160;yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-0 lead. The Chargers were unable to get past midfield on their next drive and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line with just under three minutes to play in the first half. A 25-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Chargers safety Marlon McCree would help the Patriots reach the Chargers' 26-yard line, but Brady was intercepted by safety Clinton Hart at the Chargers' 10-yard line. The Chargers then ran one play to end the half. Receiving the kickoff to begin the second half, the Chargers embarked on a 16-play, 72-yard drive, reaching Patriots territory on a 22-yard third down reception by tight end Antonio Gates. Ten plays later, fullback Lorenzo Neal caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to put the Chargers on the scoreboard at 24-7. The Patriots responded by going 75&#160;yards on seven plays, taking a 31-7 lead on a 24-yard Moss touchdown reception, his second of the night. Three plays later, Rivers was intercepted by Patriots safety James Sanders at the Patriots' 38-yard line, but the play was nullified by a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs. Rivers completions of 19&#160;yards to wide receiver Malcom Floyd and 12&#160;yards to running back Michael Turner helped put the Chargers in the Patriots' red zone, where Rivers completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gates on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the Patriots' lead to 31-14.. On the ensuing kickoff, Chargers wide receiver Kassim Osgood forced a fumble of Hobbs after a 31-yard return that was recovered by Chargers cornerback Quentin Jammer at the Patriots' 31-yard line. However, Rivers was sacked twice for losses of 10&#160;yards each on the next two plays, the second of which was a strip-sack by Colvin that was recovered by offensive lineman Kris Dielman; the Chargers punted on 4th-and-30. Starting from their own 9-yard line with more than 13&#160;minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots did not surrender the ball back to the Chargers until there was less than four minutes left in the fourth quarter. This 15-play, 91-yard drive culminated in a 3-yard touchdown run by running back Sammy Morris, extending the Patriots' lead to 38-14. The Chargers could not convert a first down on their next possession, giving the ball back to the Patriots to end the game as they improved to 2-0. Based on the above article, answer a question.

While the app does perform its basic function of editing and managing host files, there are several areas where improvements could be made, both in terms of functionality and user experience. Firstly, the user interface is rather simple and minimalistic. Although it is easy to navigate, the design could use a more modern touch to make it aesthetically appealing. Additionally, there are some occasional lags and delays when opening or editing larger host files, and I believe optimizing the app's performance should be a priority for future updates. Regarding the features, the app offers a basic set of tools for editing and managing host files. While these work as intended, they could be expanded upon to cater to power users, such as the ability to organize host records into folders or categories and the option to sync files across different devices. This functionality would make managing and maintaining complex files more efficient for those who require it. Another aspect that could be improved is the in-app help and documentation. While the app has a minimal learning curve, a well-organized help section or tutorial would be beneficial for users who are new to the concept of managing and editing host files. Although the app is functional and serves its purpose, there are areas where improvements in performance, design, and features could make the com.nilhcem.hostseditor app a more comprehensive and user-friendly choice for editing and managing host files.

Amanda Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend was there to see the start of proceedings. Instead, the 26-year-old was photographed taking a walk in her home town of Seattle, more than 5,000 miles from the the trial. Miss Knox has said she will not return to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007. Scroll down for video. Amanda Knox was all smiles in the rain in Seattle, Washington, as she chatted on the phone while picking up supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy. Knox and her one-time lover Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial. In June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies contradictions and illogical conclusions’. Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’.

Does the sentence \\"It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What was the Meija era marked by?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"What was the Meiji Era marked by?\\". However, since a long and detailed answer is required, let me expand on this topic. The Meiji Era was marked by Japan's rapid modernization and the transformation from an isolated feudal society to a nation standing on par with Western powers within just a few decades. This period spanned from 1868 to 1912 and was characterized by profound change in the political, social, economic, and cultural aspects of the country. Following the unification of Japan by the Tokugawa Shogunate in the early 17th century, the nation closed its borders to most foreign contact in an attempt to maintain ideological and political control. However, the arrival of American Commodore Matthew Perry in 1853 and his display of naval and technological might led to the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which effectively forced Japan to end its isolationist policy. The Tokugawa Shogunate's inability to maintain Japan's sovereignty during this period amplified internal political strife and led to the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Emperor Meiji, under the guidance of a group of ambitious and talented samurais (such as Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, and Saigo Takamori), oversaw the collapse of the shogunate and the reestablishment of centralized imperial rule. To prevent further encroachment of foreign powers, Japan's leaders recognized that the key to preserving Japanese independence was to modernize and industrialize the nation, primarily by adopting Western technology, economic models, and political systems. Some of the significant changes during the Meiji Era included: 1. Political and Administrative Reform: The Meiji government adopted a modern, centralized bureaucratic structure and formulated the Meiji Constitution in 1889, which provided for a constitutionally limited monarchy and a bicameral legislature. 2. Economic Modernization: The Meiji government invested heavily in infrastructure like railways, telegraph lines, and modern ports. Additionally, it created a banking system, modernized the tax system, and initiated a series of industrial policies to promote domestic industry and reduce reliance on foreign products. 3. Military Reform: The Japanese military underwent significant modernization, as the government focused on adopting Western military techniques, tactics, and equipment. In 1873, universal conscription was introduced. By the 1890s, Japan had one of the most modern and powerful militaries in Asia. 4. Education Reform: Western-style education systems were introduced in the Meiji Era, emphasizing science, technology, and foreign languages. In 1872, a new Education Law established compulsory education for primary education in Japan, laying the foundation for a literate and skilled workforce. 5. Social and Cultural Change: The gradual erosion of the samurai class's dominance and the promotion of social mobility greatly impacted Japanese society. Japan's rapid modernization altered the cultural landscape as well, as the government encouraged the adoption of Western clothing, architecture, and artistic styles. 6. Foreign Policy: In a bid to revise the unequal treaties imposed on Japan by foreign powers in the mid-19th century, Japanese leaders looked to project their newfound strength and power internationally. This ambition led to military victories against China in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and against Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). In conclusion, the Meiji Era was marked by Japan's rapid and comprehensive modernization, resulting in remarkable political, economic, social, and cultural transformations that allowed Japan to establish itself as a world power. The sentence provided derives its validity from these transformations that occurred during the Meiji Era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information: - Herodium (Latin), Herodeion, best known in Israel as Herodion and in Arabic as Jabal al-Fureidis (lit. \\"Paradise Hill\\") is a truncated cone-shaped hill, located south of Jerusalem and southeast of Bethlehem, in the Judaean Desert, West Bank. Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert. Today, the site is managed by the Israel National Parks Authority. - The Second Temple was an important Jewish Holy Temple (\\"Beit HaMikdash HaSheni\\") which stood on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period, between 516 BCE and 70 CE. According to Jewish (and subsequently, Christian) tradition, it replaced Solomon's Temple (the First Temple), which was destroyed by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered and a portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken into exile in Babylon. - Antipater II ( Greek : ; c. 46 -- 4 BC ) was Herod the Great 's first - born son , his only child by his first wife Doris . He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean . He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However , he was recalled following Mariamne 's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will . He retained this position even when Alexandros and Aristobulos ( Herod 's sons by Mariamne ) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC , and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC ( with Herod Philip I in second place ) . However , in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus , then Roman governor of Syria , charged with the intended murder of his father Herod . Antipater was found guilty by Varus ; however , due to Antipater 's high rank , it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death . After the guilty verdict , Antipater 's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas . Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC , Antipater was then executed , and Archelaus ( from the marriage with Malthace ) was made heir in his father 's will as king over Herod 's entire kingdom ( with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories ) . We know two of Antipater 's wives through the writings of Josephus . First was his niece Mariamne III , daughter of Aristobulus IV. The second was a high - ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history . She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean , the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest . This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I , renowned royal wife of Herod the Great . Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris , Antipater 's mother , in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC. - Aristobulus II was the Jewish High Priest and King of Judea, 66 BC to 63 BC, from the Hasmonean Dynasty. - Antipater I the Idumaean (died 43 BC) was the founder of the Herodian Dynasty and father of Herod the Great. According to Josephus, he was the son of Antipas (I) and had formerly held that name. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Judea or Judæa (from , \\"Yhuda\\", \\"Yhûh\\", , , \\"Yahudia\\") is the ancient biblical, Roman, and modern name of the mountainous southern part of Palestine. The name originates from the Hebrew, Canaanite and later neo-Babylonian and Persian name \\"Yehudah\\" or \\"Yehud\\" for the biblical Israelite tribe of Judah (Yehudah) and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Yehud, Yehud Medinata, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. - Mariamne I (died 29 BCE), also called Mariamne the Hasmonean, was a Hasmonean princess and the second wife of Herod the Great. She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led to him executing all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne. - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. - Titus Flavius Josephus (37 100), born Joseph ben Matityahu (Hebrew: , \\"Yosef ben Matityahu\\"; Greek: ), was a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer, who was born in Jerusalemthen part of Roman Judeato a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed royal ancestry. - The Herodian Dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Idumaean/Edomite descent. The Herodian dynasty began with Herod the Great, who assumed the throne of Judea, with Roman support, bringing down the century long Hasmonean Kingdom. His kingdom lasted until his death in 4 BCE, when it was divided between his sons as a Tetrarchy, which lasted for about 10 years. Most of those kingdoms, including Judea proper, were incorporated into Judaea Province in 6 CE, though limited Herodian kingship continued in Northern Levant until 92, when the last Herodian monarch, Agrippa II, died and Rome assumed full power over his domain. - Herod (\\"Hordos\\", Greek: , \\"Hrds\\"; 74/73 BCE 4 BCE), also known as Herod the Great and Herod I, was a Roman client king of Judea, referred to as the Herodian kingdom. The history of his legacy has polarized opinion, as he is known for his colossal building projects throughout Judea, including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem (Herod's Temple), the construction of the port at Caesarea Maritima, the fortress at Masada and Herodium. Vital details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century CE RomanJewish historian Josephus. Herod also appears in the Christian Gospel of Matthew as the ruler of Judea who orders the Massacre of the Innocents at the time of the birth of Jesus. Despite his successes, including singlehandedly forging a new aristocracy from practically nothing, he still garnered criticism from various historians. His reign polarizes opinion amongst scholars and historians, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, or a reminder of his tyrannical rule.

The mother and son who are allergic to SUNLIGHT: Pair have rare condition which means exposure causes them agonising pain Claire and Sam Turner have a condition that makes their skin very sensitive Being exposed to sun or light, their skin can feel as if it's on fire If they go outside during the day they have to cover all of their skin They have to wear long sleeves, gloves and to tie scarves around their faces Sam is even sensitive to light bulbs so at school has to sit in a dark corner A mother and her son both suffer from a devastating allergy to the sun which means any exposure to it causes them agonising pain. Claire Turner, 50, and son Sam, 13, have a rare medical condition called erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) - a condition which causes the skin becomes incredibly sensitive to natural light. Any exposure to the sun causes them agonising pain and Sam’s allergy is so severe he has to remove some light bulbs in the family home because they cause his skin to feel as though it’s on fire. Claire and Sam Turner have a rare genetic condition which makes their skin incredibly sensitive to sunlight As a result, they are forced to stay under cover in the daylight hours and wear long sleeves, gloves and even masks to avoid spending days in agony. Ms Turner and Sam even have to cover their faces with scarves if they venture out in sunlight. Sam’s condition is so severe it is also triggered by low energy light bulbs and fluorescent strip lights - meaning every unknown building can be a danger to his health. Ms Turner, from Thame, Oxfordshire, said: ‘We’re like a vampire family - we can’t come out in the sun and live our lives in the dark. ‘If I stay in the sun for longer than a few minutes it feels like somebody is pouring boiling water over me. ‘Sam is even affected by low energy light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, we have to remove the bulbs from the ceilings at school so that he has an area where he can sit in darkness. If they go outside during the day, Ms Taylor and Sam both have to completely cover their exposed skin to avoid suffering an agonising reaction which makes them feel like they are having boiling water poured over them ‘He lives his life looking up - to make sure he doesn’t get hit by the wrong kind of light.’ The windows in the family’s house and car are specially protected against UV rays and they now have a mobility badge so the family can park in spaces nearest to shops and limit exposure to the sun. Ms Turner’s daughter Jo, 16, carries the EPP gene but is not light sensitive - meaning she can go outside in the sun without horrendous pain. Ms Turner said: ‘I thought my children had escaped the condition - until my youngest Sam started having reactions to the light at the age of eight. WHAT IS ERYTHROPOIETIC PROTOPORHYIA (EEP)? EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation ‘I was devastated - he’s had to learn to live his life all over again by keeping out of the light. ‘If the other boys go outside he can’t go with them - he sits in his room playing Play Station.’ At work as a nursery nurse, Ms Turner has a special black tent for when the children go outside to allow her to perform her duties while staying out of UV rays. She said: ‘Every outing has to be strategically planned - we have to sit at the back of restaurants away from the windows, and we can’t visit swimming pools with glass roofs. ‘We spend our time skirting round the edge of buildings to avoid the sun - the only place we can go easily is the cinema - because we can just sit in the dark.’ The condition means that the family can’t visit hot countries or spend days outside. Ms Turner said: ‘The best family holiday we ever had was a cruise, Sam and I could spend our days below deck playing games and activities whilst Jo sprawled in the sunshine. ‘It’s hard for Sam - it’s something we’ll both have to live with for the rest of our lives.’ The pair have been supported by the British Porphyria Association and now give talks about dealing with the rare condition at their meetings. Hermione Lawson from The British Skin Foundation said: ‘Erythropoietic protoporphyria, also known as EPP, is a rare skin disease that causes the skin to become oversensitive to sunlight. ‘When sunlight reaches the skin, either directly or indirectly, it causes tingling, itching or burning, even redness and swelling, and can be very painful. ‘The condition usually starts in childhood, and although it is a hereditary condition, it is not always passed on from parent to child - so it is not unusual to have just one child with the condition.’ EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. Ms Turner's daughter, Jo, does not have the condition and so is not sensitive to sunlight It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem.

I suffer from a rare skin condition that means I experience a severe burning sensation when exposed to UV light. When it happens, my blood feels as though it's boiling and I can't bear anything touching my skin, including clothes. The pain can last for several days and nights, causing severe sleep deprivation. If it's a bad attack, my hands and face swell up. At times it has lasted for weeks. I'm not even safe inside, because the windows of buildings and cars intensify the rays, and lightbulbs can emit small amounts of UV light, as can television and computer screens. On overcast days, the sun pokes through the clouds; it also reflects off concrete, water and snow. My two younger sisters also suffer from the condition, and one of my earliest memories is of the three of us huddled in the porch of our house, desperately trying to keep away from the light. We would do anything to hide from the sun, and always wanted the curtains drawn. Our parents couldn't understand it – there were no physical signs of our pain, just some dirty-looking patches on our skin sometimes. Eventually, when I was eight, a specialist diagnosed me and my sisters with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a condition caused by a reaction to the combination of our parents' genes. The diagnosis felt like a mixed blessing: it meant we were allowed to wear jeans, long-sleeved blouses and big straw hats to school, and at break we were allowed to stay under a big oak tree, but it also meant the other children made fun of us, knowing we couldn't chase them. I longed to fit in, and that feeling stayed with me at college. One really sunny day, when all the students went to the park, I decided to risk it and join them. That night, my face swelled up like never before and the pain was unbearable. I was supposed to meet my boyfriend – now my husband – the next day, but I couldn't face him, so I asked a friend to say I was ill. Not surprisingly, it didn't take long for him to realise that my condition could be debilitating. Later, we wondered whether we should have children, but we went for it and eventually had four. I remember very tentatively taking each of them outside as babies, worrying they had the condition, too. Thankfully, none of them did. I was determined that they shouldn't suffer because of my condition. But I did struggle to take them out on clear days, and if we went outdoors or in a very light building, I'd have to announce almost as soon as we got there that we couldn't stay long. School sports days and picnics were a nightmare because I had to sit in the shade, often some distance away, and I paid a high price afterwards. Hot holidays were out of the question and we never went to beaches. Sometimes the condition can be extremely severe. In really bad years, it takes just a few seconds of exposure to set off a reaction, and I never get any warning signs. Sadly, the bad years seem to come more often now, and weeks or even months can pass without my being able to leave the house. The emotional impact is the worst. While my marriage is strong, not going out much means it's difficult to make friends. When I do go out, I have to wear a big floppy hat, coat, gloves and large sunglasses, which I can't take off even indoors and which make people think I'm peculiar, so they avoid me and often stare. Even my family don't really understand – my daughter gets angry about how I'm dressed. At home, my only solution has been UV protective film on all my windows. I used to have it in my car, too, but the law bans that now. Two positive things have happened recently, though: I've been put on daily vitamin D tablets, which have helped with the aching bones caused by its deficiency; and a special protective cream minimises the pain more than anything has before. I have also met others with the condition, through Facebook. There are at least 1,000 people in the UK with EPP and I'm also in touch with sufferers in America. Though UV rays mean I can't stay on the computer for long, it's been wonderful to share experiences. For the first time, I have friends who truly get it. • As told to Kate Hilpern Do you have an experience to share?

Write a summary based on this article: At the nation’s top nuclear weapons labs and plants, safety mishaps have imperiled life and limb, and hindered national security operations. This Scientific American story is part of a one-year investigation by reporters at the Center for Public Integrity that reveals many problems and little accountability. In addition to the Nevada accidents, a near-fission calamity in 2011 at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico led to an exodus of nuclear safety engineers and a four-year shutdown of operations crucial to the nation’s nuclear arsenal. Yet penalties for these incidents were relatively light, and many of the firms that run these facilities were awarded tens of millions of dollars in profits—or even new contracts—after major safety lapses occurred. Not a clue. The government scientists didn’t know they were breathing in radioactive uranium at the time it was happening. In fact, most didn’t learn about their exposure for months, long after they returned home from the nuclear weapons research center where they had inhaled it. The entire event was characterized by sloppiness, according to a quiet federal investigation, with multiple warnings issued and ignored in advance, and new episodes of contamination allowed to occur afterward. All of this transpired without public notice by the center. Here’s how it happened: In April and May 2014, an elite group of 97 nuclear researchers from as far away as the U.K. gathered in a remote corner of Nye County, Nev., at the historic site where the U.S. had exploded hundreds of its nuclear weapons. With nuclear bomb testing ended, the scientists were using a device they called Godiva at the National Criticality Experiments Research Center to test nuclear pulses on a smaller and supposedly safe scale. But as the technicians prepared for their experiments that spring—under significant pressure to clear a major backlog of work and to operate the machine at what a report called Godiva’s “upper energy range”—they committed several grievous errors, according to government reports. The machine had been moved to Nevada nine years earlier from Los Alamos, N.M. But a shroud, descriptively called Top Hat, which should have covered the machine and prevented the escape of any loose radioactive particles, was not reinstalled when it was reassembled in 2012. Also, because Godiva’s bursts tended to set off multiple radiation alarms in the center, the experimenters decided to switch the alarm system off. But because the alarms were connected to the ventilation and air filter system for the room, those were shut off as well. The only ventilation remaining was a small exhaust fan that vented into an adjacent anteroom where researchers gathered before and after experiments. The Godiva reactor in Nevada released radioactivity accidentally. Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Wikimedia On June 16, 2014, a month after the experiments were completed, technicians doing routine tests made an alarming discovery—radioactive particles were in the anteroom. They then checked the room holding Godiva, and found radiation 20 times more intense there. The Nevada site’s managers, who work for a group of private, profit-making contractors—like most U.S. nuclear weapons personnel—ordered the rooms decontaminated. But they didn’t immediately check exposures among the scientists and researchers who had gathered for the tests, many of whom had already gone back to their own labs. None had any clue about the mishap until two months after the experiments, on July 17, when one of them—a researcher from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory nuclear weapons lab in California—got the results from his routine radiation monitoring. His urine tested positive for exposure to enriched uranium particles. National Security Technologies,, LLC (NSTec), the lead contractor that runs the Nevada site, subsequently collected urine specimens from its own workers who’d been in the room with Godiva during the experiments. It discovered three of its technicians also had inhaled highly-enriched uranium. News of trouble spread--but only among the scientists and their bosses, who were accustomed to a shroud of official secrecy covering their work. No public announcement was made. According to an initial U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) investigative report dated April 28, 2015, calls eventually went out to test the 97 people present for the Godiva experiments. But for reasons that remain unclear the testing went very slowly, and not until 2016 did the DoE state that 31 were discovered to have inhaled uranium. In a letter last summer to the Los Alamos and Nevada lab directors, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Frank Klotz suggested that the employees’ radiation doses were not large—at the high end, they were roughly equivalent to 13 chest x-rays. But once inhaled, uranium particles can keep emitting radiation for years, and so they pose an added cancer risk. Klotz’s letter deemed the exposures “safety-significant and preventable.” It could have been even worse, of course, given the absence of any timely warning. Lab Operations Riddled with Errors The four key national facilities involved in the underlying experimentation—Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore, the Nevada Test Site and Sandia National Laboratory—are among the U.S.’s premier scientific labs. They collectively employ more than 26,000 people engaged in cutting-edge and often dangerous work, governed by myriad nuclear safety regulations, with two major contract enforcement mechanisms meant to inflict financial pain when needed on the private corporations that operate them. And yet in this case, and in others like it, not only were the labs’ procedures and responses riddled with errors, but even after attention was called to these incidents, other safety mishaps occurred. And the financial penalties imposed by the government didn’t seem to have a major impact on the labs’ conduct. A review by The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) of more than 60 safety mishaps at 10 nuclear weapons–related federal sites that were flagged in special, internal reports to Washington, along with dozens of interviews of officials and experts, revealed a protective system that is weak, if not truly dysfunctional: Fines are frequently reduced or waived while contractors are awarded large profits. Auditors say labs and production plants are overseen by an inadequately staffed NNSA and DoE, which as a result largely rely on the contractors to police themselves. The CPI probe, partly based on documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveals a system in which extra profit is awarded under a rating profile that persistently places higher priority on the nuclear weapons labs’ national security “mission” than on worker protections, putting production far ahead of safety. Experts say it is a practice in keeping with a culture of urgent, no-holds-barred work that took root in the nuclear weapons complex during World War II. These production pressures flow down to the highly secured rooms where workers labor with special clearances, routinely handling highly toxic and explosive materials. The DoE typically gives the private companies involved a financial bonus when they accomplish their missions on a deadline, notes Ralph Stanton, one of 16 workers exposed to radiation in an incident at Idaho National Laboratory in 2011. “When the [bonus] milestone is in play”—meaning on the occasions corporate lab operators gain extra pay by meeting production deadlines—some of the workers feel that “safety is completely gone.” Tracy Bower, a spokesperson for the contractors that operate the Nevada Test Site, said its performance “scores” are high and that “our primary concern has been and continues to be the safety of our employees and our community.” When the Nevada accident occurred, the Godiva experiments had considerable urgency. After being moved to Nevada from Los Alamos, the machine was originally supposed to resume operations in 2010, near three similar machines inside a tubular-shaped building about the size of two football fields, with a striking white top barely visible aboveground because it is swaddled in compacted earth. But in August of that year the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an independent federal safety agency that monitors nuclear weapons operations, warned in a letter (pdf) to NNSA that it was concerned about “deficiencies” at the experimental facility housing Godiva, including potentially unreliable radiation alarms. Neither NNSA nor the site’s private contractor had “conducted sufficiently detailed design reviews of the facility,” the board’s chair, Peter Winokur, wrote. Godiva’s operation was postponed, but the controlled bursts of radiation were finally restarted in September 2013. That same month the DoE’s Office of Inspector General warned that some safety issues persisted with Godiva, including flaws in some instrumentation related to safety and incomplete documents meant to guide workers safely through their tasks. The inspector general’s report (pdf) also warned that more than a third of the time, when the contractors involved said they had fixed problems flagged by the government, they hadn’t actually done so. The inspector general blamed the delays and problems, in part, on “weaknesses in federal oversight.” A Workplace Hazardous to Whistle-Blowers But inadequate supervision from Washington was only part of the problem. According to a separate August 2013 report by the DoE’s workplace health and safety office, the leaders of NSTec were generally inattentive to workers’ safety concerns and resentful of NNSA oversight. Amid a rise in workplace injury and illnesses at the site—which the report did not explain—the contractor had depicted the government’s inquiries about it as an “overreaction.” The report said that because the contractor did not consistently encourage open communications, frontline workers feared retaliation if they complained to their supervisors about safety issues. It said two such cases of retaliation surfaced during the safety office’s inquiry. Overall, the report said, significant stresses existed on the site’s “safety and security culture” and there were “indications of a chilling effect” on worried workers. It was against this backdrop that the Godiva contaminations played out over several months the following year. The device is an open-faced, ugly stack of high-tech machinery, shelving and wires that stands as tall as a man. Inside are rings and blocks of highly enriched uranium, a key nuclear explosive; they are made to fission, just slightly, when they are delicately moved closer by at least two technicians. The point is to generate modest bursts of radiation useful for researching nuclear power, training nuclear safety experts, predicting weapons effects and making bomb components less vulnerable to radiation storms in a nuclear war. Those who gathered for the experiments came from Los Alamos, which oversaw the work; Lawrence Livermore; Sandia; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State; Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee; the Nevada Field Office of the National Nuclear Security Administration; and the U.K.’s Atomic Weapons Establishment. In a push to make up for lost time, experimentation on Godiva was placed on an accelerated schedule. As a September 2016 report detailing the NNSA’s review of the contaminations noted, “During April and May 2014, there was an increased campaign of Godiva burst operations, some of which were in the upper energy range of Godiva's capability.” All the while, with radiation alarms silenced, the particles of uranium were being piped into the main Godiva room and an area where experimenters thought they’d be safe. Although the contamination started showing up in June, it was not until August 7, 2014, that the DoE’s Nevada Field Office at the site shut down Godiva’s operations. Another 11 days passed before technicians noted even higher contamination levels inside the room that housed the machine. The contractors involved—from Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and the Nevada test site—didn’t determine that this incident merited a formal safety report to Washington for another two weeks. A spokesperson for NNSA, Greg Wolf, wrote in an e-mail that all the exposure levels were below regulatory limits and posed minimal health risks. He wrote Godiva’s operations are now being closely monitored and that the contractors that run Nevada and Los Alamos “take any unexpected exposure seriously.” Still, with those types of exposures, “there is some incremental risk that you might get cancer,” said Joel Lubenau, a certified health physicist, industry consultant and former senior adviser to a chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He said the degree of risk depended on how large the particles were and whether they were soluble enough to enter the bloodstream and reach key organs. He also said he was highly surprised to hear the alarms had been turned off and that the protective shroud was never installed. No Fines for Repeated Safety Infractions The fallout from the episode went on for years. On October 21, 2014, four months after the original Godiva leakage, technicians detected excess radioactive particle contamination outside the Flattop critical assembly device, another open-faced radiation-burst machine similar to Godiva, located in an adjacent building. Contamination also showed up again in the Godiva equipment room. A week later workers shut down Flattop. But oddly, “no formal causal analysis was performed,” according to a 2016 settlement order summarizing DoE investigative findings on the Godiva incident. It was assumed that it was all related to Godiva, the order disclosed. The settlement order called the Godiva room’s monitoring system inadequate, the hazard controls “insufficiently designed and implemented,” and the management response “slow” and “less than adequate.” But because the NNSA had docked contractors’ profits—87,000 for NSTec and 500,000 for Los Alamos National Security, LLC—due to overall operational shortcomings, it levied no fines specific to the safety infractions.

Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management And following a common pattern, these events amounted to only a portion of the documented mishaps at both labs during this period. In September 2013, for example, security personnel at the Nevada site unexpectedly found a trailer full of Los Alamos’s low-level radioactive waste sitting in a parking lot outside Gate 100 of the Nevada site. The trailer had been sent there for disposal but the site had refused to accept it because it lacked appropriate shipping papers describing the trailer’s contents, so it was left in the parking lot for a week. After an investigation, Los Alamos voluntarily suspended its shipment of low-level waste to Nevada. Due to continuing problems with paperwork, Los Alamos wasn’t cleared to restart its waste shipments to Nevada until September 15, 2014, a full year after the trailer was discovered. During the same period Los Alamos was sending other, more dangerous waste to the DoE’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, N.M., for underground storage. But in December 2013 one of its subcontractors added organic instead of inorganic material to one of the drums—based on a mistyped transcript of an internal meeting where the waste-packaging requirements were discussed. And in February 2014, after being sent into the bowels of WIPP with the wrong material inside, a drum exploded, sending radioactivity throughout the facility and shutting it down for nearly three years—at an estimated 1.5-billion cost to the government. For that, in 2014 the Los Alamos contractor had its profits cut by 57 million, less than 4 percent of the repair bill. In that episode the final Accident Investigation Board report (pdf) said supervisors had “fostered a culture where employees do not feel comfortable raising safety issues to management.” Ernest Moniz, secretary of Energy from May 2013 to January 2017, said shortly before leaving that the day the drum exploded at WIPP was by far the worst day of his tenure. Los Alamos, he said in a subsequent interview with CPI, had “inadequate quality control in how they were packaging the wastes. There is no sugarcoating that.” Moniz also said that during his tenure, there was “a clear pattern” in which the nuclear weapons laboratories were annually ranked more poorly by his department on their “operations” than on their other tasks, with Los Alamos “in particular…the lowest.” He said he had “no doubt they have had some management problems.” Even after the WIPP debacle, moreover, Los Alamos’ troubles with worker safety were not over. On May 3, 2015, when a worker sprayed cleaning fluid inside a cubicle with high-voltage connections that he thought had been turned off, he caused what’s known as an “arc-flash” explosion that blew him out of the cubicle and burned him over 30 percent of his body. “It caused him enormous suffering,” recalls Don Nichols, who was then the NNSA associate administrator for safety and health. “He made an understandable human error, where controls that should have protected him were not there.” For these failings and more, NNSA’s then-Principal Deputy Administrator Madelyn Creedon in 2015 cut nearly 6 million from the Los Alamos contractor’s available profit in 2015, and the on-site contracting officer cut another 7.2 million just for the arc-flash. Yet the government still gave the contractor nearly 44 million in profit, or 71 percent of the total available to it. In 2016, however, it decided to force a new competition for the roughly two billion dollar annual contract to manage the laboratory, a decision that Moniz attributed in the interview to the current contractors’ “operational failure.” Impunity for Top Managers David Overskei, a nuclear physicist and consultant in San Diego who has been hired by both the NNSA and its contractors, said, however, that in his view the award of profit based on performance is “having impact—it’s just not having the desired impact.” Instead of driving consistently good behavior, he said, performance-based profits inspire contractors to find ways to meet minimum standards to collect their bonus. Overskei, who’s analyzed conditions at NNSA sites and led a congressionally chartered study of the NNSA’s management system in 2006, said in a telephone interview that “there need to be consequences when people don’t do their management job, and the consequence needs to be getting fired. That simply doesn’t happen.” Unsealed nuclear waste drum shows explosion effects. Credit: U.S. Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management He pointed out that even though the NNSA withheld substantial profit from the contractors that operate Los Alamos National Laboratory as well as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant after the 2014 accident there, the top leaders at Los Alamos, where subcontractors made the mistake that caused the radiation-exposure accident, kept their jobs. “In the commercial world, I guarantee you a lot of people would have lost their jobs, and not lower-level people,” Overskei said. At NSTec, safety problems similarly persisted after the uranium incident. On June 13, 2014, a 55-gallon metal drum containing an explosive chemical blew up as it was being lifted by a worker, sending shrapnel into his leg and even into the tire of a truck some yards away. The worker was blown eight feet out of the shed bay where he was working, leaving him with shrapnel wounds, minor burns to his face and arms, and contusions. An investigation found that isopropyl alcohol in the drum had been transformed by the Nevada desert heat and air into organic peroxides, which are “exceptionally prone to explosive decomposition.” An accident board determined that the explosion was “wholly preventable” and criticized the contractor team for not having a comprehensive, company-wide chemical safety program, according to the board’s report on June 13,, 2014. Then, on February 26, 2015, a worker was overexposed to vapors in a degreasing operation. The chemical in question, 1-bromopropane, has been linked to neurological illnesses, cancer and reproductive disorders. An enforcement letter from Steven Simonson, director of the DoE’s Office of Enforcement, to NSTec dated October 6, 2015, said the incident “revealed recurring issues in chemical handling and control” that were also evident during the drum explosion. The letter, however, was just a warning and no fines were imposed. Four months later, on June 24, 2015, some storage drums containing other chemicals spontaneously erupted in a fire. The drums had been stored in a warehouse but moved to an uncovered pad where the blistering Nevada heat hit 102.4 degrees—“temperatures well in excess” of what is considered safe, an enforcement letter from Simonson to NSTec said. It took almost three hours for the fire to burn itself out. That letter, dated February 22, 2016, cited both the drum explosion and the fire as evidence of similar safety failures: “Both events resulted from improper storage of hazardous chemicals and a lack of understanding regarding storage and environmental factors that affect chemical stability,” the letter said. Once again, the correspondence expressed concern but levied no fines. The Nevada contracting consortium—a partnership of Northrup Grumman, AECOM, CH2M Hill and Babcock & Wilcox—has run the site since 2006. On November 14, 2014, the year of the Godiva incident, NSTec had its profit cut by 4.2 million—to 26.4 million, or 86 percent of the maximum available—due to what the NNSA called recurrent, systemic problems such as a lack of transparency and accountability, ineffective operations, and weaknesses in its worker safety and health programs, according to a copy of the government’s payment letter. The following year NSTec again earned roughly the same amount—26.3 million—in profits, or 90 percent of all that was available. An enforcement notice about the drum explosion, dated August 25, 2015, cited NSTec for multiple failings related to chemical storage and hazards, resulting in four Severity Level I violations and one Severity Level II. But because NSTec had its profits docked for other problems in 2014, NNSA Administrator Klotz levied no safety fines in 2015. And in 2016 the consortium earned 29.4 million, or 93 percent of what was available that year. Despite the high performance ratings it gave NSTec, the NNSA announced on May 12, 2017, that Mission Support and Test Services LLC – a consortium of Honeywell, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and Stoller Newport News Nuclear, Inc. – would take over operation of the Nevada site at the end of September as the NSTec contract expires after 11 years. The new contract could span a decade with a total budget of 5 billion if the government awards all extension options. Such options were awarded to NSTec every year that it ran the site. The consortium that forms NSTec did not bid to keep managing the Nevada site, according to Bower, its spokesperson. She did not explain why. The new group, said NNSA spokesperson Wolf, “was awarded the contract because its proposal was determined to represent the best value to the government over the other offerers.” NSTec’s run at the site may be extended, however. The shift to a new manager has been delayed by a legal fight about the NNSA’s decision between the winning bidder and a rival group. Until that dispute is resolved, Wolf said, NSTec will continue to operate the site. ||||| Nuclear Negligence Nuclear Negligence examines safety weaknesses at U.S. nuclear weapon sites operated by corporate contractors.

It also discovered that the penalties imposed by the government for these errors were typically small, relative to the tens of millions of dollars the NNSA gives to each of the contractors annually in pure profit.

Question: Question: \\"What was given to Napoleon's force?\\" Context: \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Napoleon's force, initially known as the Armée d'Angleterre and later as La Grande Armée, was given several key resources and advantages. These include: 1. Careful and invaluable training: The troops at Boulogne received thorough training in preparation for future military operations. This prepared them not only for potential invasion of England but also for various future campaigns. 2. Core formation of La Grande Armée: The men at Boulogne formed the foundation for Napoleon's renowned army, La Grande Armée. 3. Organized structure: The French army was organized into seven corps, with 200,000 men at the start. Each corps was a large field unit containing 36 to 40 cannons and capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. 4. Strong defensive positions: These corps were designed to survive at least a day without support in a strong defensive position, providing the Grande Armée with numerous strategic and tactical options during campaigns. 5. Cavalry reserve: In addition to the main force, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 men. This reserve included two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. 6. Expansion and growth: By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, showcasing its considerable size and strength. 7. Well-equipped and well-trained soldiers: The members of the Grande Armée were provided with proper equipment, training, and competent leadership from experienced officers. Overall, Napoleon's force was given careful training, strategic organization, a strong defensive structure, a dedicated cavalry reserve, and the necessary resources to become an effective and powerful fighting force."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: – High-intensity interval training is all the rage, with research suggesting that just a few minutes of all-out sweating could reap the same health benefits as a 45-minute moderate workout, and that's true even for the elderly. The draw is clear—interval training takes less time, after all—but so is the drawback, as the New York Times reports: Pushing ourselves with such intensity even in short bursts can be grueling. But new research out of McMaster University in Ontario suggests that while it's hard, HIIT might not be all that unpleasant, and that when people listen to music while pushing hard, they rather like it. \\"This research tells us that they can actually enjoy it, and they may be more likely to participate in HIIT again if they try it with music,\\" says one researcher, per Psych Central. Reporting in the Journal of Sports Sciences, researchers say they studied 20 young, healthy, and physically active men and women performing HIIT for the first time in two scenarios—one without music, and one with—and that each session was followed an hour later by questionnaires. The volunteers rode stationary bikes, starting with an easy two-minute warmup before four 30-second bursts of all-out pedaling. Turns out that on a scale of 1 to 7, where 7 is \\"I loved it,\\" most ranked the exercise a 5, but their ratings climbed to 6 after they did the training to music. The tunes also made them more likely to continue with the training. Whether these findings would translate to a larger group of people who are more sedentary remains unclear. (Just don't exercise when you're angry.) Article:","completion":"High-Intensity Interval Training, or HIIT, is a way of exercising where you work really hard for a short time, then rest, then work hard again. It's like mixing lots of short races into one workout! Some smart people did a study and found out that if you do HIIT, you can get the same good things for your body as if you did a longer, slower workout - even if you're older. That means you can have more time to play or do other fun things. But sometimes, pushing ourselves to work hard can be tough and not always fun. New research from a place called McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found that HIIT might not be that bad after all, especially if we listen to music while we do it. The people who did the research said, \\"This tells us that people can actually enjoy HIIT, and they may be more likely to do it again if they try it with music.\\" They wrote about their study in the Journal of Sports Sciences. What they did was, they got 20 healthy young men and women to try HIIT for the first time. They did it in two different ways: one without music, and one with music. After each time, the people filled out a questionnaire to tell the researchers how they felt about the workouts. The people in the study used stationary bikes, like the kind you see in a gym. They started with an easy two-minute warmup, and then they pedaled really, really fast for 30 seconds, four times. When they asked the people how much they liked the workout, most of them said they liked it a medium amount, like a 5 out of 7. But when they did the workout with music, they liked it even more, like a 6 out of 7! The music also made them more likely to keep doing the workouts in the future. The researchers aren't sure if these findings would be the same for people who don't exercise a lot, but it's a good start. So, if you want to try HIIT and make it more fun, just turn up your favorite tunes and dance, run, or pedal away! Just remember, don't exercise when you're angry - it's better to be happy while working out."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This is because your donation can provide immediate help to them, like buying a meal or other necessities. On the other hand, giving advice about how to get a job is not an immediate solution and might not always work.

Article: Magna Carta edition found in Sandwich archive scrapbook Magna Carta has been on display at the Houses of Parliament Continue reading the main story Related Stories An early edition of Magna Carta has been found in a Victorian scrapbook during a search of a council's archives The discovery has come months ahead of the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta in Runnymede in 1215. Kent archivist Dr Mark Bateson had been asked to search for another charter from the town of Sandwich. Dr Bateson found the town's Charter of the Forest in a Victorian scrapbook in Kent County Council archives - with the long-forgotten Magna Carta edition. The document was ripped with about a third missing but could still be worth up to £10m, according to Professor Nicholas Vincent, a specialist in medieval history from the University of East Anglia. Its high value comes from the fact that it was found with the Charter of the Forest. The only other such pair - dating from 1300 - in the world is owned by Oriel College, Oxford. Many pictures show King John signing Magna Carta at Runnymede - although experts agree it was sealed Professor Vincent, who asked Dr Bateson to search for the forest charter in December and went on to authenticate the Sandwich Magna Carta after it was found, said it was \\"a fantastic discovery\\". He said it backed the theory that Magna Carta was issued more widely than previously thought, to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports. He also said the discovery gave hope that further copies would also turn up. Twenty-four editions of Magna Carta, which established the principle of the rule of law, are currently known to exist. The Magna Carta Research Project describes the Sandwich document as a \\"previously unknown exemplar of the 1300 Magna Carta\\", over half a metre in length, but missing text and its royal seal. What was Magna Carta? Magna Carta at Salisbury Cathedral dates from 1215, one of four of the first documents that are still around Magna Carta outlined basic rights with the principle that no-one was above the law, including the king It charted the right to a fair trial, and limits on taxation without representation It inspired a number of other documents, including the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Only three clauses are still valid - the one guaranteeing the liberties of the English Church; the clause confirming the privileges of the City of London and other towns; and the clause that states that no free man shall be imprisoned without the lawful judgement of his equals Why are there so many Magna Cartas? Experts said the 1300 Magna Carta was issued by Edward I and was apparently the last to be drawn up. They said the discovery of the Sandwich Magna Carta brought to seven the number of surviving originals of 1300. It is understood Sandwich does not plan to sell its copy but does hope to benefit from it as a tourist attraction. Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said owning the forest charter and Magna Carta was \\"an immense privilege\\". He said: \\"Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide. \\"To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.\\" This week, four 1215 versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament; two from Salisbury Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral and two from the British Library. ||||| An edition of Magna Carta which could be worth up to £10 million has been found after it lay forgotten in a council's archives. The discovery of the version of the historical parchment which established the principle of the rule of law, in the files of the history department of Kent County Council, has been described as an important historical find by an expert. The document was found in the archives kept in Maidstone but belonging to the town of Sandwich. Speaking from Paris, Professor Nicholas Vincent, of the University of East Anglia, who authenticated the document, said: \\"It is a fantastic discovery which comes in the week that the four other known versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament. It is a fantastic piece of news for Sandwich which puts it in a small category of towns and institutions that own a 1300 issue.\\" Prof Vincent said the fact Sandwich had its own Magna Carta gives backing to the theory that it was issued more widely than previously thought to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports. And he added the discovery gives him hope that further copies will also turn up. There are only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. Prof Vincent said: \\"It must have been much more widely distributed than previously thought because if Sandwich had one... the chances are it went out to a lot of other towns. And it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet.\\" Prof Vincent, who specialises in medieval history, said the value of the Sandwich edition could be up to £10 million, but it was ripped with about a third missing. He said: \\"This would be an upper value as it has, like the town of Sandwich, suffered over time from French invasions and the like.\\" The discovery was made by archivist Dr Mark Bateson at the end of December just before the 800th anniversary year celebrations of King John's concession. The Sandwich Magna Carta was found when Prof Vincent asked Dr Bateson to look up a copy of the town's original Charter of the Forest. It was found next to the charter in a Victorian scrapbook and its high value comes from the fact it also comprises the Forest Charter. There is only one other such pair in the world, owned by Oriel College, Oxford. It is understood that Sandwich does not intend to sell its Magna Carta but instead is hoping to benefit from its potential as a tourist attraction. Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said: \\"On behalf of Sandwich Town Council, I would like to say that we are absolutely delighted to discover that an original Magna Carta and original Charter of the Forest, previously unknown, are in our ownership. \\"To own one of these documents, let alone both, is an immense privilege given their international importance. Perhaps it is fitting that they belong to a town where Thomas Paine lived, who proposed in his pamphlet Common Sense a Continental Charter for what were then the American colonies, 'answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England... securing freedom and property to all men, and ... the free exercise of religion'.\\" He added: \\"Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide. To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.\\" The four known 1215 editions are from Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral and two held at the British Library. They were brought together for a one-day exhibition at Parliament for a crowd of 2,015 chosen by a public ballot. Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: \\"Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta. The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: \\"Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives. The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.\\" The parchment, which was issued by Edward I in 1300, is the final version of Magna Carta and three of its clauses remain on the statute books today. These include the defence of the church, the protection of the City of London and the right to trial by jury. The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on June 15, 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons. It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years. |||||Summary:","completion":"A very special old paper called the \\"Magna Carta\\" was found in a special book in a town called Sandwich in England. This paper is over 700 years old and is very important because it has special rules on it that help people have fair laws and protect their rights. The Magna Carta is so important that it helped make other important papers like the United States Constitution, which helps run the United States of America. People think this old paper could be worth a lot of money, like 10 million pounds! But the town of Sandwich wants to keep it and maybe show it to people who come visit their town.

Passage 1:Appearing at the Gasteig in 2005, she performed Chopin's Piano Concerto in E minor with the Münchener Kammerorchester, conducted by Christoph Poppen. In 2008, Babor appeared in a recital at the Ushuaia festival playing works by Beethoven, Prokofieff, Schubert and Ginastera, and Mozart's Piano Concerto in C major, K. 482. In 2009, as part of the project Musik Werkstatt Jugend (youth music workshop), she played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto in C minor with the ensemble interculturel in concerts in Munich's Herkulessaal and in Rouen. In 2011, she was the pianist in a concert at the Gasteig concluding a festival to honour the 200th birthday of Franz Liszt on October 22. The program Hommage à Liszt juxtaposed chamber music by Liszt with that by Graham Waterhouse. The music was scored for piano solo up to piano and string quartet, including the premiere of Rhapsodie Macabre. Passage 2:Ray Arnott played in a number of major Australian groups: he replaced founding drummer Mark Kennedy in Spectrum and played with them from 1971 until the group disbanded in 1973; this was followed by a brief stint in the short-lived \\"supergroup\\" Mighty Kong (which included former Cam-Pact/Co. Caine guitarist Russell Smith and former Daddy Cool members Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford. This was followed by stints with The Dingoes (1973–1976), various solo projects (1978–80), Cold Chisel (1983–84) and Jimmy Barnes Band (1984–85). In 1969, Glass scored the role of Berger in the original Australian stage production of Hair, and performed on the award-winning original cast recording. After leaving that production, in the early 1970s (with David Pepperell he founded the pioneering Melbourne import record store \\"Archie & Jughead\\". In 1977 Glass established a new store and record label, Missing Link, which re-issued Cam-Pact material including a compilation album, Psychedelic Pop 'n' Soul 1967-69 (October 2002) alongside many other notable releases, including the earliest recordings by The Go-Betweens and The Birthday Party. Chris Löfvén became a film maker, creating pioneering Australian \\"film clips\\" (music videos) for Daddy Cool and Spectrum; he also directed a feature film, Oz (1976), alongside his continuing music work (often with Keith Glass). Russell Smith co-founded progressive rockers Company Caine (1970–75) and was also (with Arnott) a member of the short-lived Mighty Kong. Stockley was a founding member of early Australian \\"supergroup\\" Axiom (1969–71) and The Dingoes (1973–1978, 2009–present). Robert Lloyd went on to study and teach music and become a successful composer, poet, songwriter and recording artist. Passage 3:Beechey began racing at the age of 22 in a Ford Customline V8. He came to prominence only a year later when he won the Olympic Touring Car Race at Albert Park, a support event at the Australian Grand Prix meeting which was held in conjunction with the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. As the expense of running this and two subsequent Customline V8s proved too prohibitive he reverted to a Holden 48-215 in 1959. After becoming part of David McKay’s Scuderia Veloce team he again returned to V8s, developing a Chevrolet Impala with which he won the New South Wales Touring Car Championship at Catalina Park. He progressed to a Ford Galaxie owned by Len Lukey and was then instrumental in forming the Neptune Racing Team in 1964. He raced a Holden EH S4 as part of that team alongside Jim McKeown’s Lotus Cortina and Peter Manton’s Morris Cooper S. He subsequently developed and raced a series of V8 powered Touring Cars with which he contested the Australian Touring Car Championship and other events.

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of what this statement is trying to convey, let me break it down and explain each segment. 1. \\"When the human fertilization\\": This phrase refers to human-induced nutrient input, specifically fertilizers, which are used to improve crop yield and growth in agriculture. Fertilizers typically contain high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, among other essential nutrients, to support plant growth. 2. \\"which flowed into the sea from the land\\": This phrase highlights the movement of the fertilizers from land to the sea. This transfer typically occurs due to runoff, where excess water carries the nutrients along with it as it makes its way into rivers, estuaries, and eventually the ocean. 3. \\"helps\\": The term \\"helps\\" suggests that the flow of nutrients is contributing positively to a process. In this context, we can assume that it is referring to the growth and increase of plankton populations. 4. \\"increasing the amount of plankton further\\": This phrase indicates that the addition of nutrients from human-produced fertilizers is causing a significant increase in the abundance of plankton in the ocean. Considering these different phrases, the statement essentially means: Human-induced nutrient input, specifically in the form of fertilizers, is carried from the land where it has been applied, through runoff into rivers and estuaries, eventually finding its way to the ocean. This nutrient-rich input serves to boost the growth and increase the overall population of plankton in the sea. This increase in plankton could have ecological and environmental implications, such as a potential boost in the food chain, where plankton serves as a primary food source for a multitude of marine organisms. However, it's worth noting that excessive nutrient input and the resulting increase in plankton populations can lead to harmful algal blooms, oxygen depletion in certain areas, and other negative consequences for marine ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the freehold lease?\\" is in \\"Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \\"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery.

Answer:","completion":"The freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies. Here is why my rationale for this answer: The given text content denotes that \\"the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century\\" and \\"needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold\\", so there were parts of it that were sold and speculated.

The tobacco which is used to make cigarettes was first grown in what is now part of the United States. Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, saw the Indians smoking. Soon the dried leaves were transported to Europe. In the late 1800s, the Turks made cigarettes popular. Cigarette smoke contains at least two harmful substances, tar and nicotine. Tar, which forms as the tobacco burns, damages the lungs and therefore affects breathing. Nicotine, which is found in the leaves, causes the heart to beat faster and increases the breathing rate. Nicotine in large can kill a person by stopping a person's breathing muscles. Smokers usually take in small amounts that the body can quickly break down. Nicotine can make new smokers feel dizzy or sick to their stomachs. The heart rate for young smokers increases 2 to 3 beats per minute. Nicotine also lowers skin temperature and reduces blood flow in the legs and feet. It plays an important role in increasing smokers' risk of heart disease and stroke. Smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and several other deadly diseases. The following effects are caused by Nicotine EXCEPT that _ . A) it can make new smokers feel dizzy or sick to their stomachs B) it lowers skin temperature C) it causes the heart to beat less fast D) Nicotine will probably kill a person if a smoker takes in too much of it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation. After reading the above, is \\"Three quarters of an hour\\" the correct answer to the question \\"From the time Atta and Omari boarded their flight in Portland, how long did it take them to reach Boston\\"?

They got on a plane at 6:00 in the morning in a place called Portland. Then, they flew to another city called Boston. They arrived in Boston at 6:45 in the morning. That's when their journey from Portland to Boston ended. Now, to know how long it took them to reach Boston, we need to see the difference between when they started and when they finished. They started at 6:00 and finished at 6:45. So, it took them 45 minutes to reach Boston. Now we need to decide if \\"Three quarters of an hour\\" is the right answer. Well, we know that one hour has 60 minutes, and three-quarters of an hour is like cutting the hour into four equal parts and taking three of those parts. When we do that, we get 45 minutes.

Existing within the \\"Find My iPhone\\" app, this functionality allows users to locate their misplaced AirPods by making them play a sound. Additionally, the app also shows their last known location when connected to the paired device. 3. Siri Enhancements Apple's intelligent personal assistant, Siri, comes with enhancements, making it more advanced and valuable than ever before. The new iOS 10.3 upgrade enables users to pay bills (via supported payment apps), schedule rides from ride services like Uber or Lyft, and even verify car status when connected to compatible automobile apps.

It was written, composed, and produced by Morissette herself, and released as the album's lead single on 8 February 2002. It is a pop rock song, featuring a shuffling, largely acoustic-rock framework. Lyrically, \\"Hands Clean\\" caused controversy, since it is reportedly the singers recollection of a forbidden sexual relationship she shared with a much older man when she was approximately 14 years of age. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work. Her following album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", was released in 1998. - \\"Precious Illusions\\" is a song written, recorded and produced by Alanis Morissette, for her fifth album \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002). It released as the album's second and final international single on 5 August 2002. Its lyrics describe a conflict between idealism and realism, and its protagonist refers to her childhood fancies as \\"precious illusions\\" that she has distanced herself from with a feeling that reminds her of \\"parting with an imaginary friend\\". - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions. - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Under Rug Swept is the fifth studio album and third internationally released album by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Released by Maverick Records in the United States on February 26, 2002 and in the United Kingdom a day earlier (see 2002 in music), it was the first album Morissette had written and produced all on her own. It debuted at number one on charts in 12 countries, including the United States and Canada, and produced the singles \\"Hands Clean\\" and \\"Precious Illusions\\". Sales, however, did not match those of Morissette's previous two studio albums. - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - \`\` Utopia '' is a pop rock song written by Alanis Morissette , and produced by her for her fifth album , Under Rug Swept ( 2002 ) . - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch.

In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In the given question, there are two aspects to consider: the availability of more water due to increased rainfall, and the second effect mentioned, which is the process of mixing pancake mix with water. The increased rainfall would result in more water available for various uses, including mixing pancake batter. However, the actual effect on the amount of water used in the pancake mix would depend on several factors. If there is more rain and it results in a significant increase in the overall availability of water for the general population, it may lead to people being less restrictive with their water usage. Consequently, they might use more water while mixing the pancake batter, potentially leading to a thinner or less consistent batter. In this case, the effect on the second step mentioned in the process (mixing pancake mix with water) would be more significant due to increased availability of water. On the other hand, if the increase in rainfall doesn't have a substantial impact on the overall availability of water, it may not influence the amount of water used for pancake mix. People might still be cautious with their water usage and adhere to the recommended ratio of pancake mix and water. In this scenario, the effect of increased rainfall on the pancake mix-water ratio would be minimal or have no effect. Now, let's consider the supposed perturbation, which implies an unexpected or sudden change in the process or the system. The mention of a perturbation within the context of the question suggests a change in the overall availability of rainfall or water and how it may affect the second step in the process, i.e., mixing pancake mix with water. Assuming that the perturbation results in a sudden increase in rainfall and water availability, it could lead to a consequent increase in water usage while mixing the pancake batter, as explained earlier. This additional water could, in turn, influence the texture and overall outcome of the pancakes, making them less consistent or thinner than desired. However, if the perturbation doesn't have a significant impact on water availability, it would have minimal or no effect on the pancake mix-water ratio. In other words, the increased rainfall would not affect the second step, and the preparation of pancakes would continue as usual. In conclusion, the effect of increased rainfall on the amount of water used for pancake mix depends on various factors, primarily the actual availability of water and how people adjust their water usage accordingly. If there is a considerable increase in water availability due to the perturbation, it could lead to more water usage in the pancake mix. Conversely, if the perturbation doesn't have a significant influence on water availability, it would lead to no effect or minimal effect on the pancake mix-water ratio."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \\"fiction\\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III, Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him.

As that happens, one of the seals is opened. Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading.

Out of the listed options, \\"bed\\" is the most plausible hiding place for such items for several reasons. 1. Privacy: A young boy's bedroom is widely regarded as their personal domain, a space associated with their belongings and preferred activities. The bed, in turn, plays an important role in the formation of emotional comfort and a sense of ownership. By hiding the magazines under the bed or within the bedding, the young boy believes he can secure their concealment and protect his privacy. 2. Accessibility: In maintaining a hidden stash of dirty magazines, it is crucial for the young boy to access them when desired without arousing suspicion. A bed presents a convenient location as it is both a private and easily accessible spot. Many beds may have a gap beneath them or bedding with pockets in which magazines can be stored and retrieved with minimal effort. 3. Familiarity: The young boy is well-acquainted with his room and its contents, possessing knowledge of its nooks and crannies that others may not be aware of. Utilizing this familiarity, a child conceals such materials in places they believe to be obscure and unknown to others, often resorting to the vicinity of their bed. 4. Sense of control: The fear of being discovered is a constant concern for the young individual with such magazines. Hiding them under or near the bed allows for an element of control over their secret, as they can monitor their belongings closely and take action to move them if necessary. While the other options presented - library, drawer, dentist, and airport - offer unique scenarios, they do not align with the reasons mentioned above. A library, dentist, or airport would be public spaces that do not provide the necessary privacy and personal control for a young boy to hide explicit content. A drawer, although within the confines of the child's room, may still be easily accessible by others and is a rather apparent hiding spot that does not satisfy the need for secrecy. In conclusion, the rationale behind choosing \\"bed\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where do young boys hide dirty magazines?\\" is rooted in the understanding of privacy, accessibility, familiarity, and control intrinsic to human behavior. These factors collectively make the area around the bed the most plausible choice for a young boy to conceal such material."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Image copyright AFP Image caption Anna Iriyama was one of two AKB48 members injured in Sunday's attack Two members of popular Japanese pop group AKB48 were injured after a man attacked them with a saw. Rina Kawaei, 19, and Anna Iriyama, 18, were meeting with fans in the northern city of Takizawa on Sunday when a man lunged forward and slashed them. They sustained cuts on their hands and heads, reported Kyodo. A male staff member was also cut on his hand. The group holds the Guinness record for being the world's largest pop group. The police have arrested the 24-year-old man, identified as Satoru Umeta. AKB48's manager was reported as saying the two girls' surgery was successful and they would be able to leave the hospital by Monday. A Tokyo concert scheduled for Monday night and other fan events have been cancelled. News of the attack was covered widely in national media. AKB48, which was founded in 2005, is hugely popular in Japan and other Asian countries. Image copyright AFP Image caption Rina Kawaei, seen here in a June 2013 photo, reportedly suffered injuries to her right thumb AKB stands for Akihabara, the technology district of Tokyo, where the group has its own theatre. Members perform there almost every day. The number 48 reportedly refers to the original number of members in the group, although it has since expanded. The current line-up on the group's website, spread over four main teams and other smaller ones, lists 140 names. Every year tens of thousands of fans vote on who gets to join the group from a pool of more than 200 candidates, in an event that is widely covered by national media. Members have to abide by strict rules set by their management, and are not allowed to date. The band made international headlines last year when one of its members, Minami Minegishi, shaved her head and apologised to fans in a video posted online. She had been caught spending a night with her boyfriend. The incident sparked debate on whether pop idols in Japan have the right to lead normal lives. ||||| Staff members are seen at a fan event site where members of Japanese girls' pop group AKB48 were stabbed in Takizawa, Iwate prefecture, in this photo taken by Kyodo May 25, 2014. TOKYO (Reuters) - A man wielding a saw slashed and injured two members of Japanese female pop group AKB48, rated by Guinness as the world's biggest such group, at a fan event in Japan, leaving the country stunned at the extremely rare violent crime. The group, known for its perky routines, was shaking hands with fans at a meet-and-greet function on Sunday, when the man attacked them with a weapon described variously as a 50-cm (20-inch)-long saw or a hatchet, Japanese media said. \\"This sort of thing is unimaginable,\\" one fan told Japanese television. \\"I'm in shock.\\" Group members Rina Kawaei,19, and Anna Iriyama, 18, received emergency surgery for cut and broken fingers, with Iriyama also suffering cuts to the face, media said. \\"The surgery ended successfully and their condition is stable,\\" their manager said. \\"They should be able to leave hospital tomorrow.\\" A male staff member received cuts to his hand. Police arrested a 24-year-old high school dropout for attempted murder after the event, in the northeastern city of Takizawa, was interrupted by screams of \\"Stop!\\" and \\"No!\\" There were no bag checks, and fans have said most of the group's events have only cursory checks at best, prompting newspapers to call for tighter security. The incident featured on several newspaper front pages and television shows. Security checks tend to be light in Japan, which has stiff gun control laws, and violent crime involving weapons is rare. AKB48, founded in 2005, is known for its high \\"kawaii,\\" or cuteness, quotient, and all its members are in their teens or early 20s. Fans vote each year to determine 64 of the most popular girls from a 237-member pool, who then rotate in and out of four main troupes and several affiliated groups, based on their popularity. The \\"AKB\\" in the group's name is a reference to Akihabara, Tokyo's high-tech mecca, where it has a theatre. They are also popular overseas, with a sister group based in Jakarta. Every year fans elect the most popular members of the group, obtaining a ballot by buying the group's latest CD. Some hard-core fans buy hundreds to give their favourite a boost. A Tokyo concert by the group scheduled for Monday night has been cancelled, as have other meet-and-greets, their management company said on its website.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.

Which inventor was known as ‘The Wizard of Menlo Park’????","completion":"The inventor known as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\" is Thomas Alva Edison, who was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, and passed away on October 18, 1931, in West Orange, New Jersey. This nickname is a reference to Edison’s laboratory and research facility, which was located in the village of Menlo Park in New Jersey (now part of the city of Edison). The name was given to him by a newspaper reporter, who was impressed by Edison’s vast array of inventions and the innovative environment he created in his laboratory. Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor and businessman whose inventions and contributions had a significant impact on the world. Over his lifetime, he held more than 1,000 U.S. patents, as well as numerous patents in other countries. Among his most famous and influential inventions are the electric light bulb, the phonograph, and the motion-picture camera. These inventions played a key role in shaping the modern world and have become integral to our everyday lives. Edison's process of invention involved not only his individual genius but also the collaborative efforts of a dedicated team. He established the first industrial research laboratory in Menlo Park, where he brought together skilled engineers, technicians, and scientists to work on various projects. This model of innovation through teamwork and collaboration has become a fundamental part of modern research and development. In addition to his well-known inventions, Edison made strides in various industries. He improved the telegraph and telephone systems, developed an alkaline storage battery, created an electric power distribution system, and worked on countless other projects. His tireless work in multiple fields earned him various accolades, including the title of \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park,\\" as his inventions seemed almost magical to people of his time. Edison's impact on the world went beyond his inventions; he founded and was involved in several companies, most notably the Edison Electric Light Company and the General Electric Company, both of which have grown into major corporations today. His groundbreaking work has had a lasting impact on various fields, including communication, entertainment, and energy. Thomas Edison's legacy as \\"The Wizard of Menlo Park\\" lives on through the countless lives he's touched and transformed with his inventions and innovations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: Are multi-label CNNs trained using images containing multiple lables? Question 2: Which one is best among these dual booting or vmware and why? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer your two questions individually, let's break them down and analyze them step-by-step. Question 1: Are multi-label CNNs trained using images containing multiple labels? Step 1: Identify the main topic in the question. The main topic here is \\"multi-label CNNs\\" (Convolutional Neural Networks). Step 2: Understand the query. In this case, the question is about the type of images used in training. Step 3: Provide the answer. Multi-label CNNs are indeed trained using images containing multiple labels. This is because these networks are designed to identify and classify multiple objects within an image, rather than focusing on just a single object as it is the case in single-label CNNs. Question 2: Which one is best among these dual booting or VMware and why? Step 1: Identify the main topic. In this case, the main topic is the comparison between \\"dual booting\\" and \\"VMware.\\" Step 2: Understand the query. The question asks for the better choice between the two options and a justification for the choice. Step 3: Provide the answer. The choice between dual booting and VMware (or any other virtualization software) depends on your specific needs and preferences. Dual booting allows you to run two separate operating systems on your computer, which may provide better performance and a more native experience for the secondary OS. However, switching between the two systems requires a reboot. VMware, on the other hand, uses virtual machines to run multiple operating systems simultaneously but may use more system resources and could lead to less optimal performance. Your choice should be based on whether you prioritize performance/native experience (dual booting) or the convenience of running multiple OSs simultaneously without rebooting (VMware). Now, to determine if the answers to these questions would be the same, we need to analyze their topics and context. Step 1: Compare the topics of the questions. - Question 1 discusses Multi-label CNNs and their training. - Question 2 compares dual booting and VMware in terms of usage and preferences. Step 2: Determine if there is any overlap between these topics. - There is no apparent overlap between these topics. One is related to artificial intelligence and image classification, while the other revolves around operating systems and virtualization. Based on this analysis, the answers to these two questions would not be the same, as they address unrelated subjects and inquiries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We are not sure yet why the American volleyball coach's father-in-law had to die in front of his family Saturday, when all he wanted was be another tourist at the Beijing Drum Tower. Someone stabbed him to death barely five miles from the Olympic flame. Two more were injured, his wife seriously so. The killer committed suicide, using a tower leap as his exit. Suddenly, the Olympics did not seem quite as happy, or quite as safe. But we don't yet know why. The crowds were barely seated at the first round of events when the news spread Saturday. The word reached as far as the Great Wall, where the cycling road race was finishing. This is what the Olympics are supposed to be on their first day, riders grinding through the Juyongguan Pass where Genghis Khan used to roam. Not crime scenes. For the record, Beijing now has as many victims of violence as Atlanta. A lousy number to share. The motive is still not understood. Can we agree on what we're all thinking? Did some Beijing head case go out looking for Americans? If not that, more routine answers might have to be explored. Robbery. Madness? Simply the urge to kill? China has not seen much trouble of this sort. The man might have taken his twisted rationale with him when he jumped. It seemed unfathomable, regardless of reason. This is a city with security on red alert, and police on every corner. You can't swing a shopping bag without hitting soldiers marching down the street. Somewhere out there, too, are missiles and helicopters and metal detectors. All that, and one man kills another in broad daylight, at a busy landmark. The Chinese have been desperately waiting on the sun for their Olympics. But here came a dark cloud. Should we be afraid now, or just sad at how quickly bad news can strike, 12 hours after the fireworks closed a stirring Opening Ceremony? There was such a strong message Friday night about sport's place in a better world. Obviously, one future killer was not paying attention. Something quickly comes to mind about this assault; Beijing's chosen slogan for its Games. \\"One world, one dream.\\" We are all in this together, is the general idea. More alike than we know. And here, suddenly, is bloody proof. A story with such malice might be rare in China, but it is nothing new on the other side of the world. In the USA, the story of a senseless fatal attack followed by a suicide leap would hardly qualify as news. On Saturday, then, China looked an awful lot like us. This is probably not the one world the Olympic hosts had in mind. They must be mortified by the act. No expense has been spared in energy or cash to put on this gala. China has tried to woo the world with its contented masses, and now one sick soul has made his own headlines. By Saturday evening, there was sand spread on the pavement near the scene, presumably where the killer leapt to his death. An 800-year-old tower had become part of the Beijing Games, and also part of America's view of them. The Olympics go on, though. The USA meets Venezuela Sunday, with an unexpected dose of poignancy. Meantime, the Chinese police have a case to crack. Garden variety street crime, or terrorist attack? It'd certainly be good to know.

But bet you don't know why \\"Gemütlichkeit\\" is untranslatable (let alone unpronounceable), what false teeth were doing in the lost property bin last year and whether the yodeling or oompah tent would best suit your personality. Read on, Lieblings. Bavaria's biggest beer love-in kicks off in Munich on Saturday, September 21, and runs through October 6. 1. Gird your bosom, hitch those hosen Worried that squeezing into a bosom-lifting dirndl or a pair of skin-tight lederhosen will make you look ridiculous? Bavarian bonding is about sing-alongs, and one such tune you'll hear time and again at the festival is \\"Ein Prosit der","completion":"Gemütlichkeit.\\" Or simply \\"A toast to Gemütlichkeit.\\" The term \\"Gemütlichkeit\\" does not have a direct translation in English, but it is associated with a sense of well-being, comfort, and conviviality, which come as an integral part of Oktoberfest's atmosphere. Conveying much more than the loose interpretations of 'cosiness' or 'conviviality'; this word is at the heart of Bavarian attitudes to socializing. So don't worry about how you look; Oktoberfest is all about Gemütlichkeit. One fun fact about Oktoberfest; you might be surprised at the number of strange items that get lost and end up in the lost & found each year. Among last year's findings were not only countless IDs, wallets, and phones, but also more peculiar items including false teeth. It might seem strange, but with the relaxed, convivial atmosphere and perhaps a beer too many, the festival-goers sometimes end up misplacing some of the most unexpected items. When it comes to the musical choice of the Oktoberfest, it largely depends on personal preferences. If you have a fondness for traditional folk music, then the yodeling tent is the place for you. Yodeling has a long history in Bavarian culture and offers an unconventional, joyful musical experience for those interested. On the other hand, if you prefer rhythmic, catchy music that can carry on the night and make you sway in no time, an oompah tent is the right choice for you. Oompah bands, characterized by their unique deep brass sound, are a staple of any Bavarian festivity. The lively beats of oompah music will undoubtedly keep you in high spirits throughout the night. The main thing to remember is, whether you're donning a dirndl or lederhosen, whether you choose yodeling or oompah, Oktoberfest is about embracing and enjoying Bavarian culture in all its facets. It's about laughter, camaraderie, hearty food, and, of course, great beer. Join the festival from Saturday, September 21, and experience the very essence of Oktoberfest by girding your bosom or hitching your lederhosen. The exceptional quality of Bavarian beer, the infectious cheeriness of the crowd, and the fascinating traditions will guarantee unforgettable memories. So, let the Oktoberfest spirit taking over you, and don't forget to toast to \\"Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit!\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Information: - An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Electric motors give electric cars instant torque, creating strong and smooth acceleration. They are also around three times as efficient as cars with an internal combustion engine. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles. The energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought a short-lived interest in electric cars; although those cars did not reach the mass marketing stage, as became the case in the 21st century. - Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian car manufacturer, founded as A.L.F.A.

Please write a short summary for the following article: South Korea Launches Plan to Drive Out Older Cars SEOUL—South Korea has announced stricter emissions standards for vehicles starting next year, as part of efforts to clean up the air in its major cities. The Ministry of Environment said Thursday that old diesel-powered vehicles weighing 2.5 tons or more will be banned from Seoul if they aren’t equipped with an emission-reducing device or a low-pollution engine. The ban will be extended to Incheon and 17 other cities in Gyeonggi province in 2018, and to the remaining metropolitan areas in 2020. A diesel car produced before 2005 emits eight times more bad gases than the latest models that meet the toughened Euro 6 standards, the ministry said in a statement. About 1.04 million vehicles will be subject to the regulations. Cars that violate the regulations will be fined 200,000 won (180) per detection, it said. The ministry said it would help partially finance the costs needed for low-income drivers and smaller firms to buy the latest diesel cars or equip their vehicles with emission-reducing devices. Diesel-powered vehicles have risen in popularity in Korea in recent years, largely because of better fuel efficiency than gasoline-powered cars and a shift in consumer appetite to sport-utility vehicles. Diesel cars account for more than half of newly registered vehicles in Korea. The latest measures come after Korea in May found that some diesel vehicles emitted up to 21 times more nitrogen oxides on the roads than at laboratories in tests conducted in the wake of Volkswagen AG VLKAY 1.69 % ’s admission last year that it falsified U.S. emissions tests on some diesel-powered cars. On Tuesday, Korea banned the sale of almost all Volkswagen cars after revoking the certifications of 80 models and handed down heavy fines, saying the German auto maker faked documents on emissions and noise-level tests. Following the Volkswagen scandal, the country has taken a series of measures to address growing public concerns about air pollution, with a view to bringing its air quality to the levels of some advanced European countries. Last month, the government said it will cut consumption taxes for consumers who turn in diesel-engine cars that are at least 10 years old when purchasing a new car. Korea also plans to spend 5 trillion won (4.48 billion) by 2020 to have more green cars on the road and improve air quality. Some cities in Europe have also taken steps to tackle air pollution.

Step 1: Understanding the premise - The premise states that Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal is influenced by elements of Tantrism, which are techniques that claim to speed up enlightenment. Step 2: Understanding the hypothesis - The hypothesis says that there are techniques called Tantrism that can speed up enlightenment. Now let's compare the premise and hypothesis: - The premise implies that Tantrism is present within some forms of Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal and that these specific techniques claim to speed up enlightenment. - The hypothesis states that there are techniques called Tantrism aimed at speeding up enlightenment. Step 3: Comparing the premise and hypothesis - Both the premise and the hypothesis mention Tantrism and techniques for speeding up enlightenment. - While the premise specifically mentions Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal as being influenced by Tantrism, the hypothesis does not mention any specific location but merely states that Tantrism exists. Given the analysis, the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise, as the premise clearly mentions the same idea as the hypothesis (i.e., that there are techniques called Tantrism designed to speed up enlightenment).

He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor.

Review: This movie has become a late-night favorite of Cinemax and the USA Network's \\"Up All Night.\\" Filmed in 1991 in Austin, TX, this ultra-low-budget comedy was a multiple nominee in the 1994 Drive-In Movie Academy Awards (\\"The Hubbies\\"), and is great viewing for anyone interested in creating or otherwise involving themselves in the area of low-budget movie making. When that wears thin, there are always \\"catgirls\\" to look at. The important lesson aspiring filmmakers should derive from this movie is what it looks like on screen when blue filters are used on the camera lens to simulate nightime during daylight shots (i.e., scrape up the extra money and BUY SOME LIGHTS). As a final note, this Troma Team release is well worth the price as a collector's item alone -- Lance Henry's feature film speaking-role debut as \\"The Paperboy\\" is only sure to rise in price.

Since 2014, RBS and NatWest have not used so-called teaser rates on savings accounts. These introductory bonuses boost the interest received in the first 12 months after an account is opened. The bank has argued that these rates make accounts difficult for customers to compare when shopping around. Les Matheson, chief executive of personal and business Banking at RBS and NatWest, told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours that such rates did not help customers. He said people found them difficult to understand and to compare. People often forgot to switch accounts once the bonus rate had expired. Last year, the bank also stopped offering 0% periods on its credit cards, during which cardholders pay no interest on their balance. Once the 0% period ends, cardholders will pay a higher interest rate - at the moment, often about 18.9% APR on their purchases. Criticising the offering of other High Street banks, Mr Matheson said they relied on customers paying the higher rate of interest. \\"We don't think that's a good way for people to manage their finances, so we've stopped doing that,\\" he said. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is currently reviewing rules on teaser rates for savings accounts, but has said it will not ban them. Mr Matheson said he agreed with FCA proposals to remind customers when a bonus period was about to end, but argued the proposals did not go far enough. RBS and Natwest offer 0.5% interest on all their savings accounts. He admitted that the rate was not very high, but insisted it was more than some customers received elsewhere. \\"Rather than people having to continually switch, let's just give them a fair everyday rate,\\" he said. Mr Matheson also defended the 100 branch closures planned by RBS and NatWest this year. He said that in some cases, only six people had been regularly going into a branch. He pointed to an arrangement with the Post Office that allows customers to access banking services and mobile banks that will move between locations. \\"If you actually look at the number of access points that a customer has, they are far, far, more today than five years ago,\\" he said. Summary:","completion":"RBS and NatWest argue against teaser rates on savings accounts, stating they are difficult for customers to understand, compare, and remember to switch, ultimately not benefiting consumers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Leslie Townes \\"Bob\\" Hope, KBE, KC*SG, KSS (May 29, 1903 - July 27, 2003) was an American comedian, vaudevillian, actor, singer, dancer, athlete and author. With a career that spanned nearly 80 years, Hope appeared in more than 70 short and feature films, with 54 feature films with Hope as star, including a series of seven \\"Road\\" musical comedy movies with Bing Crosby as Hope's top-billed partner. In addition to hosting the Academy Awards show nineteen times, more than any other host, he appeared in many stage productions and television roles, and was the author of 14 books. Hope was born in Eltham, Kent (now part of the London Borough of Greenwich), the fifth of seven sons. His English father, William Henry Hope, was a stonemason from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and his Welsh mother, Avis (nee Townes), was a light opera singer from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, who later worked as a cleaner. William and Avis married in April 1891 and lived at 12 Greenwood Street in Barry before moving to Whitehall, Bristol, and then to St George, Bristol. In 1908, the family emigrated to the United States, sailing aboard the SS Philadelphia. They passed through Ellis Island, N.Y., on March 30, 1908, before moving on to Cleveland, Ohio. From age 12, Hope earned pocket money by busking--public performing to solicit contributions (frequently on the streetcar to Luna Park), singing, dancing, and performing comedy. He entered numerous dancing and amateur talent contests as Lester Hope, and won a prize in 1915 for his impersonation of Charlie Chaplin. For a time, he attended the Boys' Industrial School in Lancaster, Ohio, and as an adult donated sizable sums of money to the institution. Hope had a brief career as a boxer in 1919, fighting under the name Packy East. He had one win and one loss, and he participated in a few staged charity bouts later in life. Hope worked as a butcher's assistant and a lineman in his teens and early twenties. He also had a brief stint at Chandler Motor Car Company. In 1921, while assisting his brother Jim in clearing trees for a power company, he was sitting atop a tree that crashed to the ground, crushing his face; the accident required Hope to undergo reconstructive surgery, which contributed to his later bizarrely distinctive appearance. Deciding on a show business career, Hope and his girlfriend at the time signed up for dancing lessons. Encouraged after they performed in a three-day engagement at a club, Hope formed a partnership with Lloyd Durbin, a friend from the dancing school. Silent film comedian Fatty Arbuckle saw them perform in 1925 and found them work with a touring troupe called Hurley's Jolly Follies. Within a year, Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with George Byrne and the Hilton Sisters, conjoined twins who performed a tap dancing routine in the vaudeville circuit. Hope and Byrne had an act as Siamese twins as well, and danced and sang while wearing blackface until friends advised Hope he was funnier as himself. In 1929, Hope informally changed his first name to \\"Bob.\\" In one version of the story, he named himself after race car driver Bob Burman. In another, he said he chose the name because he wanted a name with a \\"friendly 'Hiya, fellas!' sound\\" to it. In a 1942 legal document, his legal name is given as Lester Townes Hope; it is unknown if this reflects a legal name change from Leslie. After five years on the vaudeville circuit, Hope was \\"surprised and humbled\\" when he failed a 1930 screen test for the French film production company Pathe at Culver City, California. Hope's short-lived first marriage was to vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell, a secretary from Chicago, Illinois, who was the daughter of Edward and Mary (McGinnes) Troxell. They were married on January 25, 1933, in Erie, Pennsylvania, with Alderman Eugene Alberstadt officiating. They divorced in November 1934. The couple had shared headliner status with Joe Howard at the Palace Theatre in April 1931, performing \\"Keep Smiling\\" and the \\"Antics of 1931.\\" The couple was working together at the RKO Albee, performing the \\"Antics of 1933\\" along with Ann Gillens and Johnny Peters in June of that year. The following month, singer Dolores Reade joined Hope's vaudeville troupe and was performing with him at Loew's Metropolitan Theater. She was described as a \\"former Zeigfeld beauty and one of society's favorite nightclub entertainers, having appeared at many private social functions at New York, Palm Beach, and Southampton.\\" Their long marriage was fraught with ambiguities. As Richard Zoglin wrote in his 2014 biography Hope: Entertainer of the Century, \\"Bob and Dolores always claimed that they married in February 1934 in Erie, Pennsylvania. But at that time he was secretly married to his vaudeville partner Louise Troxell, after three years together on and off. I found divorce papers for Bob and Louise dated November 1934, so either Bob Hope was a bigamist or he lied about marrying Dolores in February that year. He'd actually married Louise in January 1933 in Erie when they were traveling on the vaudeville circuit. When he claimed he had married Dolores in Erie he was miles away in New York, on Broadway. More intriguing, there is no record anywhere of his marriage to Dolores, if it happened. And there are no wedding photos, either. But he never forgot Louise and quietly sent her money in her later years.\\" It is interesting to note that \\"New York City, Marriage License Indexes, 1907-1995\\" at Ancestry.com, includes a 1993 marriage license for Dolores Mary Defina and Lester Townes Hope in Manhattan. Dolores (DeFina) Reade had been one of Hope's co-stars on Broadway in Roberta. The couple adopted four children through an Evanston, IL, adoption agency called The Cradle: Linda (in 1939), Tony (1940), Kelly (1946), and Eleanora, known as Nora (1946). From them, they had several grandchildren, including Andrew, Miranda, and Zachary Hope. Tony (as Anthony J. Hope) served as a presidential appointee in the George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations and in a variety of posts under Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. The couple lived at 10346 Moorpark Street in Toluca Lake, California from 1937 until his death. In 1935, they lived in Manhattan. Hope continued an active entertainment career past his 75th birthday, concentrating on his television specials and USO tours. Although he had given up starring in movies after Cancel My Reservation, he made several cameos in various films and co-starred with Don Ameche in the 1986 TV movie A Masterpiece of Murder. A television special created for his 80th birthday in 1983 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., featured President Ronald Reagan, actress Lucille Ball, comedian-actor-writer George Burns, and many others. In 1985, he was presented with the Life Achievement Award at the Kennedy Center Honors, and in 1998 he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. Upon accepting the appointment, Hope quipped, \\"I'm speechless. 70 years of ad lib material and I'm speechless.\\" At the age of 95, Hope made an appearance at the 50th anniversary of the Primetime Emmy Awards with Milton Berle and Sid Caesar. Two years later, he was present at the opening of the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment at the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress has presented two major exhibitions about Hope's life -- \\"Hope for America: Performers, Politics and Pop Culture\\" and \\"Bob Hope and American Variety.\\" Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29, 2003. He is among a small group of notable centenarians in the field of entertainment. To mark this event, the intersection of Hollywood and Vine in Los Angeles was named \\"Bob Hope Square\\" and his centennial was declared \\"Bob Hope Day\\" in 35 states. Even at 100, Hope maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping, \\"I'm so old, they've canceled my blood type.\\" He converted to Roman Catholicism late in life. What made him famous?","completion":"Bob Hope became famous for his versatile career as a comedian, vaudevillian, actor, singer, dancer, athlete, and author.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition. Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.
