The decor isn't consistent or memorable but it's a quirky and comfortable place. The menu was large and there are great breakfast/lunch/dinner options. Oddly, breakfast is not offered 24/7 here unlike other similar places in the area. The service was good and food was out quickly. It is your basic diner/grill food but cooked to perfection and very delicious! We received excellent service at the bar and drinks were free while we gambled.

Review: bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"Step 1: Examine the adjective and phrases used in the sentence. In this sentence, there are several adjectives and phrases that indicate the reviewer's opinion about the movie: 1. \\"astonishing voice cast\\" 2. \\"interesting racial tension\\" 3. \\"excepting love hewitt\\" Step 2: Determine the positive or negative connotation of each adjective or phrase. Looking at the adjectives and phrases, it can be observed that: 1. \\"astonishing voice cast\\" carries a positive connotation, as the reviewer praises the voice actors in the movie. 2. \\"interesting racial tension\\" also conveys a positive impression, as it means that the movie has a noteworthy element regarding the depiction of racial issues. 3. \\"excepting love hewitt\\" has a slightly negative connotation, as it implies that the reviewer didn't think Love Hewitt's performance was on par with the rest of the voice cast. Step 3: Analyze the overall sentiment. Taking all the adjectives and phrases into account, the overall sentiment of this movie review sentence seems to be mostly positive. The positive aspects of the movie - the astonishing voice cast and interesting racial tension - outweigh the single negative point about Love Hewitt's performance.

Write an article with the title: \\"The doc ‘The Act of Killing’ has to be seen to be believed\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The doc ‘The Act of Killing’ has to be seen to be believed Introduction Imagine a documentary that not only depicts the darkest aspects of humanity, but also delves into the psyche of the perpetrators of unthinkable atrocities. This is precisely what 'The Act of Killing' aims to achieve. Directed by Joshua Oppenheimer, the film is a surreal and chilling exploration of the minds of mass murderers who participated in the 1965-1966 Indonesian genocide. In this article, we explore the reasons why this documentary is a must-see experience beyond simple comprehension. Unmasking the Perpetrators Step 1: Selecting the subjects Oppenheimer's unique approach to storytelling begins with selecting subjects who are not just accountable for their heinous crimes but are willing to reenact their actions on-camera. The film primarily focuses on Anwar Congo, a former gangster turned death squad leader, who claims to have killed over 1,000 people during a political purge. The inclusion of such a chilling character encourages an open dialogue that showcases the intricacies of his twisted thought processes. Step 2: Utilizing reenactments The use of reenactments further intensifies the viewer's experience by graphically illustrating the cruelty of these acts. This powerful visual element reinforces the stark reality of the horrors that took place, with each reenactment exposing the barbaric nature of the killers. Through this unique storytelling method, Oppenheimer offers a look into the darkest recesses of humanity and the twisted ways in which individuals can embrace violence. Understanding the Human Psyche Step 3: Scrutinizing motivation and justification One of the documentary's most compelling aspects is its focus on the motivations and justifications that the mass murderers use to rationalize their actions. The film showcases how individuals can become willing actors in such events and further highlights the dangers of conformity and obedience to authority. By examining the perpetrators' reasoning, the documentary becomes a thought-provoking exploration of human morality and ethics. Step 4: Analyzing the impact on the killers 'The Act of Killing' examines the emotional and psychological impact that participating in mass murder has on the individuals involved. Throughout the film, it is evident that some of the killers struggle with guilt and haunted memories, while others appear to have escaped any semblance of conscience. This dichotomy raises important questions about the capacity for remorse within the human heart and the potential for redemption. A Challenging Viewing Experience Step 5: Confronting viewers with reality The documentary's raw and visceral nature forces viewers to confront the reality of genocide and the depths of human depravity. This challenging experience reveals the importance of grappling with the darkest chapters of history and the responsibility society bears in acknowledging and learning from these atrocities. Step 6: Highlighting the need for empathy and understanding Ultimately, 'The Act of Killing' is a powerful reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding in a world that is fraught with division and conflict. By exposing the complexities of these events and examining the motivations and justifications of the individuals involved, the documentary encourages viewers to seek a deeper understanding of humanity and the potential for both profound evil and redemption. Conclusion ‘The Act of Killing’ is a documentary that defies expectation and transcends the typical viewing experience. It is a stark and unsettling exploration of the human psyche that demands reflection and self-examination. As a film that must be seen to be believed, it serves as a powerful reminder of the actions and consequences that define the darkest chapters in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Andreas Nikolaus \\"Niki\\" Lauda (born 22 February 1949) is an Austrian former Formula One driver and a three-time F1 World Drivers' Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. He is considered by some as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time. More recently an aviation entrepreneur, he has founded and run two airlines (Lauda Air and Niki). A week before the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, even though he was the fastest driver on that circuit at the time, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, largely because of the 23-kilometre (14 mi) circuit's safety arrangements, citing the organisers' lack of resources to properly manage such a huge circuit- i.e. the lack of fire marshals; fire and safety equipment and safety vehicles. Most of the other drivers voted against the boycott and the race went ahead. On 1 August 1976 during the second lap at the very fast left kink before Bergwerk, Lauda was involved in an accident where his Ferrari swerved off the track, hit an embankment, burst into flames and made contact with Brett Lunger's Surtees-Ford car. Unlike Lunger, Lauda was trapped in the wreckage. Drivers Arturo Merzario, Lunger, Guy Edwards and Harald Ertl arrived at the scene a few moments later, but before they were able to pull Lauda from his car, he suffered severe burns to his head and inhaled hot toxic gases that damaged his lungs and blood. As Lauda was wearing a modified helmet, the foam had compressed and it slid off his head after the accident, leaving his face exposed to the fire. Although Lauda was conscious and able to stand immediately after the accident, he later lapsed into a coma. Lauda suffered extensive scarring from the burns to his head, losing most of his right ear as well as the hair on the right side of his head, his eyebrows and his eyelids. He chose to limit reconstructive surgery to replacing the eyelids and getting them to work properly. Since the accident he has always worn a cap to cover the scars on his head. He has arranged for sponsors to use the cap for advertising. With Lauda out of the contest, Carlos Reutemann was taken on as his replacement. Ferrari boycotted the Austrian Grand Prix in protest at what they saw as preferential treatment shown towards McLaren driver James Hunt at the Spanish and British Grands Prix. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What is 1976 Nurburgring?","completion":"The 1976 Nurburgring refers to the German Grand Prix held at the Nurburgring circuit in 1976.

Dead Johnson Answer:","completion":"Title: Under the Blanket Genre: Mystery/Thriller Step 1: Introducing the characters and setting Our story takes place in a small isolated town named Hollygrove. The main character, Detective Laura Grant, is a skilled investigator from the big city who recently moved to Hollygrove for a quieter life. She's partnered with a dedicated local officer, Deputy Roger Collins. Other relevant town characters include the enigmatic Mayor Johnson, his wife Margaret, and conflicted son Michael. Step 2: Introducing the mystery One cold winter morning, the town wakes up to a shocking scene: the lifeless body of Mayor Johnson is found underneath a snow-covered blanket in the town's central park. Residents are baffled by this strange death, and the peaceful town becomes engulfed in fear and suspicion. Step 3: Delving into the investigation Detective Grant and Deputy Collins take charge of the case, questioning townspeople and gathering evidence. As they dig deeper, they discover long-held secrets, including a decades-old feud between Mayor Johnson and a rival family and a suspicious business deal that could have cost him his life. Step 4: Uncovering motives and suspects Throughout the investigation, several potential motives and suspects emerge. Margaret, the mayor's wife, is revealed to have engaged in an affair with a local businessman; Michael, their son, holds resentment toward his father for his controlling behavior; and the rival family, the Turner's, are suspected of seeking revenge for past feuds and Mayor Johnson's attempt at seizing their property. Step 5: Unraveling hidden connections While investigating these motives, Detective Grant and Deputy Collins are forced to confront their biases and challenge their assumptions about the townspeople. They learn that the connections between the suspects are deeper than they ever imagined, and that the town's facade of peacefulness hides a web of intrigue. Step 6: The final confrontation and resolution After collecting all the evidence, Detective Grant and Deputy Collins deduce that the real killer is Michael, who had an unexpected accomplice, Alice Turner, a member of the rival family. United by their shared resentment towards the overbearing figure of Mayor Johnson, they intended to frame one of their own families in order to divert suspicion from themselves. The climactic showdown occurs in an abandoned warehouse, where Michael and Alice are arrested for their crimes. Step 7: Reflecting on the impact In the aftermath of the case, the town of Hollygrove must come to terms with the tragedy and its consequences. Detective Grant and Deputy Collins reflect on the impact their investigation has had on the community and the personal growth they experienced through overcoming the challenges of the case.

Article: There is a place where Christmas lives all year long. It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: \\"Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase.\\" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants. Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses. \\"About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months. And actually when you compare that with most retailers, that follows the same pattern.\\" Wayne Bronner says the family's long-term planning and willingness to reinvest profits has developed the company into what it is...

Make evenly sized cookies. Check the cookies. Allow cookies to cool after removing from the oven.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Perfecting the Art of Baking Cookies: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Baking cookies at home is not just a fun activity for the family, but it is also an art that can be perfected with practice. Derived from the Dutch word for 'little cake,' a cookie is a small, sweet, and versatile indulgence that never goes out of style. The secret to the perfect batch of cookies lies in adopting a few simple techniques, such as using a cool cookie sheet, a liner, and even-sized cuts. In this article, we will delve into these steps and provide your cookies with that smooth, melt-in-your-mouth feel, leaving everyone reaching for more. Step 1: Prepare a Room Temperature or Cool Cookie Sheet One key to baking the perfect cookies is to start with a clean, room temperature or cool cookie sheet. Preheating the oven while preparing the dough might cause the cookie sheet to heat up. In such a case, allow the cookie sheet to cool down before using. Utilizing a cool cookie sheet ensures that the fat in the cookie dough remains solid before entering the oven. This helps in reducing the amount of spreading and helps retain the cookies' shape. Additionally, using a cool cookie sheet aids in preventing the cookie bottoms from browning too quickly or becoming overly crispy. Step 2: Use a Liner Baking cookies directly on the cookie sheet might result in uneven browning, sticking, or breaking apart the delicate creations. To prevent these mishaps, it is recommended to use a liner for the cookie sheet. A liner provides a non-stick surface for the cookies to bake and helps in even cooking. There are several options when it comes to choosing a liner. Some popular examples are parchment paper, silicone baking mats, or aluminum foil. Parchment paper is a popular choice among bakers as it is disposable, offering easy cleanup, and affords quick release and even browning. Silicone baking mats are reusable and can withstand higher temperatures without burning. Aluminum foil is a readily available option that can be used in a pinch, but remember to use the dull side facing up to avoid unwanted sticking or over-browning. Step 3: Make Evenly Sized Cookies The key to ensuring uniform baking for all cookies is to make them evenly sized. This practice guarantees that each cookie bakes at the same rate, preventing some from under-cooking while others are overdone. To ensure uniformly-sized cookies, make use of a cookie scoop or a measuring spoon to portion the dough consistently. You can also choose to hand-roll the dough into balls to ensure uniformity. Parchment paper can be used as a guide for maintaining a uniform size and shape, as it allows for pre-drawn outlines in pencil or food-safe markers that can be flipped over to maintain a clean surface. Step 4: Check the Cookies To avoid over-baking or burning the cookies, it is essential to keep a close eye on them during the baking process. Most ovens have hot spots, resulting in uneven heating and baking. Rotating the cookie sheet halfway through the baking process can address this issue. Remember to check the cookies frequently towards the end of the recommended baking time, as oven temperatures may differ. Cookies are ready when their edges turn golden brown and the middle is still slightly soft to the touch. Overcooked cookies often become hard and lose their chewy texture. Step 5: Allow Cookies to Cool After removing the cookies from the oven, it is essential to allow them to cool on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes. This softens the texture, making the cookies more tender. Once the cookies have slightly cooled, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. The wire rack allows for air circulation, preventing the cookies from becoming damp or soggy. Cooling cookies on a wire rack also helps in retaining their perfect texture and shape. Conclusion In conclusion, baking the perfect batch of cookies involves more than just following a mouth-watering recipe. A few mindful practices, such as using a cool cookie sheet, a liner, creating evenly-sized cookies, checking them regularly, and allowing proper cooling, can make all the difference in achieving the texture, taste, and appearance of delectable homemade cookies. So, the next time you decide to bake cookies, follow these tips and relish every savory bite of your delightful creations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Brush on a mixture of vinegar and water, bubbles will form over any leaks.; (B). Brush on a mixture of dish soap and water, bubbles will form over any leaks.;","completion":"(B). Brush on a mixture of dish soap and water, bubbles will form over any leaks. To check for gas leaks in pipes, using a mixture of dish soap and water is an effective and widely recommended method. This is known as the soap-bubble test. The following is a detailed guide to help you perform this test safely and effectively: 1. Preparation: - Turn off all the appliances that use gas in your home or workplace to prevent accidental ignition. - Mix a solution of one part liquid dish soap to three parts water in a bowl or a spray bottle. The mixture should be of a slightly thick consistency so that it sticks easily to the pipes. - Ensure that you have a fire extinguisher and a well-ventilated space to work in, just in case. 2. Locating the gas pipes: - Identify and locate the gas pipes that you want to inspect. They can typically be found in the basement, around appliances that use gas, or outdoor gas supply lines. - Turn on the gas supply to ensure that the gas is flowing through the pipes during the inspection. 3. Applying the soap solution: - Generously brush or spray the soap solution onto the gas pipes, joints, and connections. Make sure to cover all possible areas where leaks could occur, such as valves, threaded parts, and seams. - If you're in an area with poor lighting, use a flashlight to ensure that you don't miss any spots. 4. Observing for bubbles: - Carefully observe the pipes for any bubbles that form on the surface of the soap solution. Bubbles indicate a gas leak, as the gas escapes through the leak and creates bubbles in the soapy water. - If there are large leaks, you may hear a hissing sound as the gas escapes. In such cases, it is crucial to turn off the gas supply immediately and contact a professional to fix the issue. 5. Marking the leaks: - If you find any leaks, mark the spots with a non-permanent marker or a piece of colored tape. This will help you identify the problem areas when it is time to reapply the solution or call in a professional. 6. Addressing the leaks: - Smaller leaks may be temporarily fixed using a pipe leak tape or tightening the joints. However, it is highly recommended to call a professional gas technician to resolve the problem properly and safely. 7. Repeating the process: - Once the leaks are fixed, repeat steps 3 through 6 to ensure that there are no more leaks remaining in the pipes. It is essential to address gas leaks promptly, as they may pose risks, such as fires, explosions, or health issues from prolonged exposure to natural gas. So, make it a regular practice to check for gas leaks in your pipes to ensure safety at home or work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Laundromats are facilities that provide coin or card-operated washing machines and dryers, making it convenient and efficient for customers to carry out their laundry tasks. Several factors make a laundromat the best choice in this situation, as explained below. A. Thrift Store: A thrift store is not an ideal choice as it is a retail establishment primarily focused on selling second-hand clothing and other goods. Although you can find various types of clothing items in a thrift store, they don't provide laundry services and facilities. B. Clothing Store: A clothing store is a retail establishment selling brand-new clothing items and accessories. Similar to a thrift store, they don't offer laundry services and facilities. Their main purpose is to sell new garments to customers. C. Costume Shop: A costume shop is a store that specializes in selling or renting costumes designed for special events, holidays, or themed parties. These shops typically sell unique, elaborate clothing items designed for specific occasions rather than daily use. Like thrift stores and clothing stores, they don't provide laundry facilities or services. D. Shopping Mall: A shopping mall consists of various stores, eateries, and entertainment venues. Although you might find a laundromat within the premises of a shopping mall, it is not the shopping mall itself that offers laundry services. The mall is a centralized place where people can shop, eat, and engage in leisure activities, but laundry facilities are not considered a standard feature of most malls. E.

Customers visit laundromats to wash and dry their clothes with coin or card-operated machines. Laundromats are designed to accommodate multiple customers at once, allowing you to effectively wash your jeans when your electricity was cut off.

Question: THE HOSPITAL'S emergency room smelled like soap. The place was nearly empty when I carried Mia inside, just one couple and their kids sitting in a circle in the corner. The parents glanced up at us, then went back to praying quietly. The kids stared at the floor the whole time. I dropped Mia into a chair at the nurses' station and waited. Behind the glass wall in front of me, three nurses were talking about their various ex-husbands. It sounded like the same guy to me. I was still waiting for them to figure this out when one of them came over and asked, \\"What's the problem?\\" \\"No problem,\\" I said. \\"I just want to drop her off.\\" We both looked at Mia. A string of drool slowly slipped from her chin to her chest. \\"Has she been drinking?\\" the nurse asked. \\"I'm not really sure,\\" I said. The nurse looked back at me. \\"You're not really sure? Now what does that mean?\\" \\"I don't know,\\" I said. \\"I found her. I thought maybe I could leave her here.\\" \\"Sure, we'll just have to fill out the paperwork for that,\\" the nurse said. She smiled at the other nurses when she said it, and I couldn't tell if she was joking or not. She had me go through Mia's pockets, but all I could find was a piece of paper with an address written on it. Five Crossings. I couldn't find her ID anywhere. The nurse entered my name and address on a form, then took us down the hall to another room. What seemed like hours later, an old, red-faced doctor finally came in. He glanced at Mia and then washed his hands in the sink. \\"You the father or the boyfriend?\\" he asked. \\"Neither,\\" I said. \\"I've only just met her.\\" I couldn't take my eyes off the garbage can in the corner. It was full of bloody bandages. I wondered what had gone on in there before we'd arrived. Who is the narrator? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. The doctor B.

How do I loose 10 kgs in 3 months with diet and exercise? What are the best ways to lose weight? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Losing 10 kgs in 3 months with diet and exercise is a realistic and achievable goal. Following a structured plan and being consistent with your efforts can help you achieve this weight loss. Here's a detailed plan that can help you lose 10 kgs in 3 months: 1. Set a realistic goal: Losing 10 kgs in 3 months means aiming to lose approximately 0.8 kgs per week. This is a safe and achievable goal, ensuring that you maintain your health while losing weight. 2. Determine your daily calorie needs: Calculate your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) to determine your daily caloric needs for maintenance. You can do this by using an online calculator or consulting a dietitian. Once you know your TDEE, create a calorie deficit of 500-700 calories per day to lose 0.8 kgs per week. 3. Follow a balanced and portion-controlled diet: Include a mix of vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in your diet. Controlling portion sizes is essential to avoid overeating and keeping within your calorie range. Here's an example of what your daily meals may look like: - Breakfast: A bowl of whole-grain cereal or oatmeal with low-fat milk and a serving of fruit. - Mid-morning snack: A piece of fruit or a handful of nuts. - Lunch: A salad with lean protein (chicken, tofu, or legumes), lots of vegetables, and a small portion of whole grains (rice, quinoa, or whole-wheat bread). - Afternoon snack: Low-fat yogurt with berries or carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus. - Dinner: Grilled fish or chicken with steamed vegetables and a small portion of whole grains. - Evening snack: A cup of herbal tea or a small serving of air-popped popcorn. 4. Drink plenty of water: Stay hydrated throughout the day, aiming for a minimum of 2 liters of water. Drinking water can help control appetite, improve digestion, and support overall health. 5. Get moving: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises and strength training into your fitness routine. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, and include 2 or more days of strength training for all major muscle groups. Here's an example of a weekly exercise routine: - Monday: 30-45 minutes of brisk walking or jogging - Tuesday: Strength training (upper body) - Wednesday: 30-45 minutes of cycling or swimming - Thursday: Strength training (lower body) - Friday: 30-45 minutes of aerobic exercise (e.g., dance class, HIIT) - Saturday: Strength training (core and full-body exercises) - Sunday: Rest and recovery 6. Get enough sleep and manage stress: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night and use stress management techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to help with weight loss efforts. 7. Track your progress and stay accountable: Keep a food and exercise journal, and weigh yourself weekly to measure progress. Adjust your diet and exercise plan as needed based on your progress. To answer the second part of your question, \\"What are the best ways to lose weight?\\" and \\"How do I lose 10 kgs in 3 months with diet and exercise?\\" are related but not identical questions. The former is a general inquiry about the most effective methods for weight loss, whereas the latter is a specific question about losing 10 kgs within a set time frame using diet and exercise. The plan detailed above addresses the latter question but also includes principles that apply to the best ways to lose weight in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We leave tomorrow morning.\\" My attention was drawn away by a group of men in black jumpsuits standing around in the parking lot next to a white van with the red Asterion logo painted on its side.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Data: name = The Mill, eatType = pub, food = Japanese, priceRange = more than £30, area = city centre. Can you generate a sentence about this data?","completion":"Certainly, I can provide a detailed discussion on this data. The data you've provided suggests we're discussing an entity called \\"The Mill,\\" which is not simply a restaurant, but specifically operates under the classification of a pub. This means that, alongside the culinary opportunities it offers, a substantial part of its ambiance and appeal would likely be rooted in providing a traditional, casual environment where patrons can enjoy alcoholic beverages - typically beers, ciders, and wines - and other drinks according to their preference. Moving ahead to unravel the data further, we discover that \\"The Mill\\" offers Japanese food. Grasping the nature of this cuisine, it's interesting to visualise a pub serving dishes symbolizing this East Asian nation's gastronomical culture. Japanese cuisine, hailed for its aesthetics, intricate presentation, emphasis on seasons, and deeply respected traditions, is adored worldwide for dishes like sushi, sashimi, tempura, and a myriad of others. Customers at \\"The Mill\\" might enjoy a hybrid experience of an English pub environment coupled with exotic Japanese palate sensations. Another interesting aspect is the price range at \\"The Mill,\\" which is noted to be \\"more than £30.\\" This indicates that the establishment is not inexpensive or even moderately priced but caters to a somewhat higher-end market. The price range could be reflective of a number of factors - perhaps the quality and sourcing of ingredients used, the experience and skills of the culinary team, the services provided, or even the interiors and atmosphere of the pub. Finally, the data suggests that our subject - \\"The Mill\\" - is located in the city centre. Being in such a prime location undeniably brings its own set of advantages. It is typically the heart of activity and bustle, often well-connected by public transport, and can effortlessly attract both locals seeking leisure and tourists desiring to experience local food and culture. Therefore, the locale of the pub can contribute significantly to its footfall and popularity. In conclusion, \\"The Mill\\" seems to be a fascinating blend of East and West, where the warm, lively environment of a traditional pub meets the delicate, tasteful charm of Japanese cuisine. Though a visit may be on the expensive side, its central location makes it a potentially attractive spot for pub-goers looking for a unique culinary experience right in the heart of the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please remove spaces between words.","completion":"WhosoeverapproachethtothetabernacleoftheLord,hedieth. The phrase \\"Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth\\" is derived from the Bible. This phrase emphasizes the importance of respecting and maintaining a sacred distance from the divine dwelling place, the tabernacle. The tabernacle was the portable sanctuary used by the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness and until the construction of the first temple in Jerusalem. It housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments, and was considered the most sacred object in Israelite worship. The tabernacle was considered to be a physical representation of the Lord's presence among His people, so it was perceived as a place where the divine and the human realms were in close proximity. Because God's presence was believed to be both awesome and dangerous, strict precautions were required to prevent the defilement of the sacred space, as well as to protect the people from the lethality of God's presence. Specifically, the phrase refers to Numbers 18:22 in the Old Testament, wherein the Lord is instructing the Levites, the tribe designated as priests, about their responsibilities in relation to the tabernacle. This responsibility included ensuring that others did not come into contact with the holy items in the tabernacle, as doing so could result in death. The verse states: “Henceforth the people of Israel shall not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die.” In order to maintain the sanctity of the tabernacle, the Lord established a hierarchical system through which certain individuals were allowed access to different parts of the sanctuary. The high priest, for instance, was the only figure granted permission to enter the Holy of Holies, an inner chamber of the tabernacle containing the Ark of the Covenant. This privilege was granted once a year, on the Day of Atonement, when the high priest would intercede on behalf of the people of Israel and seek atonement for their sins. Levites, as the religious leaders of their communities, had various responsibilities associated with the tabernacle, but even they had restrictions on their access to certain parts of the sanctuary. Israelites who did not belong to the priesthood were expected to maintain a respectful distance from the tabernacle and leave the care of its holy items to the Levites. The phrase \\"Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth\\" serves as a reminder of the sacred nature of God's presence and the importance of observing boundaries and maintaining reverence in spiritual practice. It reinforces the notion that violations of the sanctity of religious spaces and holy objects can have dire consequences, both physically and spiritually. Depending on one's interpretation, the concept of death may also suggest spiritual separation from God or eternal damnation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Possible answers: (I) no; (II) yes;","completion":"(II) yes; Both questions address the concern of recognizing and identifying \\"true\\" friends in one's life. Your question is not a multi-choice problem but rather an inquiry seeking guidance in understanding the meaning of genuine friendship and identifying true friends. I will provide a detailed answer to help you evaluate your relationships and determine if you have true friends. Having true friends can enrich one's life significantly. A true friend is someone who is there with you during both the good times and the bad times, showing support, understanding, and companionship. They genuinely care about your well-being, listen to you, and respect your opinions and feelings. True friends can be hard to come by, but they are certainly worth cherishing. To determine if you have true friends, consider examining your relationships using the following criteria: 1. Trustworthiness: True friends are trustworthy and reliable. They do not betray your trust or share your personal information and secrets with others. They keep their promises and are honest with you, even when it is difficult to do so. 2. Loyalty: True friends are loyal and stand by you during hard times. They do not abandon you when things are tough or engage in gossip about you behind your back. They defend you when someone tries to mistreat or disrespect you. 3. Emotional support: True friends provide emotional support when you need it. They listen to your concerns, empathize with your feelings, and offer encouragement and advice if you ask for it. They are genuinely happy for your successes and share your sorrows when you face difficulties. 4. Mutual interests: True friends often share mutual interests and engage in activities together. While it is not necessary to have all the same hobbies, common interests can cement the bond between friends. 5. Reciprocity: True friendship involves a balance of give and take. Both parties should contribute to the relationship. A true friend does not always expect you to be the one to make sacrifices, nor do they take advantage of your kindness. 6. Open communication: True friends communicate openly and honestly. They respect your opinions and feelings, and they are comfortable discussing difficult topics with you. They value your perspective and do not shy away from addressing conflicts or differences in opinion. 7. Personal growth: True friends support and encourage your personal growth. They challenge you to become a better person, celebrate your achievements, and offer constructive feedback to help you improve where necessary. 8. Shared history: Long-time friends who have been through various life experiences together can forge a strong bond that is hard to break. This shared history serves as a foundation for the friendship and helps nurture trust, understanding, and appreciation for one another. 9. Acceptance: True friends accept you for who you are, without judgment or conditions. They appreciate your quirks and unique qualities and celebrate your individuality. To determine if you have true friends, you can reflect on your relationships based on these criteria. Ask yourself if your friends possess these qualities, and if you also offer the same in return. Genuine friendships are built on mutual understanding, trust, support, and respect. When you have true friends, you confidently know that they are there for you, just as you are there for them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Sunset Boulevard (stylized onscreen as SUNSET BLVD.) is a 1950 American film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the thoroughfare that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent-film star who draws him into her fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. Context: Sunset Boulevard attracted a range of positive reviews from critics. Time described it as a story of \\"Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best\\", while Boxoffice Review wrote \\"the picture will keep spectators spellbound.\\" James Agee, writing for Sight and Sound, praised the film and said Wilder and Brackett were \\"beautifully equipped to do the cold, exact, adroit, sardonic job they have done.\\" Good Housekeeping described Swanson as a \\"great lady [who] spans another decade with her magic,\\" while Look praised her \\"brilliant and haunting performance.\\" Some critics accurately foresaw the film's lasting appeal. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that future generations would \\"set themselves the task of analyzing the durability and greatness\\" of the film, while Commonweal said that in the future \\"the Library of Congress will be glad to have in its archives a print of Sunset Boulevard.\\" The rare negative comments included those from The New Yorker, which described the film as \\"a pretentious slice of Roquefort\\", containing only \\"the germ of a good idea\\". Thomas M. Pryor wrote for The New York Times that the plot device of using the dead Joe Gillis as narrator was \\"completely unworthy of Brackett and Wilder, but happily it does not interfere with the success of Sunset Boulevard\\". In 1999, Roger Ebert praised the acting of Holden and von Stroheim and has described Swanson's as \\"one of the all time greatest performances.\\" He says Sunset Boulevard \\"remains the best drama ever made about the movies because it sees through the illusions.\\" Pauline Kael described the film as \\"almost too clever, but at its best in its cleverness\\", and also wrote that it was common to \\"hear Billy Wilder called the world's greatest director.\\" When Wilder died in 2002, obituaries singled out Sunset Boulevard for comment, describing it as one of his most significant works, along with Double Indemnity (1944) and Some Like It Hot (1959). The modern review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 60 reviews with an average rating of 9.3/10, the site's consensus says, \\"Arguably the greatest movie about Hollywood, Billy Wilder's masterpiece Sunset Boulevard is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.\\" Question: Was the film well received?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, the film Sunset Boulevard was well received by both audiences and critics. Garnering positive reviews upon its release, Time magazine praised it as a story of \\"Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best,\\" and Boxoffice Review mentioned that \\"the picture will keep spectators spellbound.\\" Critics lauded the performances of the actors, particularly Gloria Swanson, who was described by Good Housekeeping as a \\"great lady [who] spans another decade with her magic.\\" Some reviews at the time accurately predicted the film's lasting appeal, notably The Hollywood Reporter and Commonweal. In later years, film critics such as Roger Ebert continued to praise the film as one of the best dramas ever made about the movie industry. The modern review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported a 98% positive rating with an average score of 9.3/10, reflecting the enduring approval of the film. Sunset Boulevard has been hailed as a masterpiece and one of director Billy Wilder's most significant works, solidifying its place as a well-received and highly acclaimed film."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It also asks about how federal policies might have been aimed at increasing private saving. - The hypothesis states that the national saving is not impacted by these federal policies. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Each of the guests made a particular fuss over Kelly, the younger one, admiring her dress, her hair and her smile. They said she was a remarkable girl to be carrying coats upstairs at her age. I thought to myself that we adults usually _ the younger one because she's the one who seems more easily hurt. We do it with the best of intentions.

Plot title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Movie plot: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. As the students argue on-and-off, they discover a vent that allows them to navigate to different rooms that... My question: What happens to Megan at the end of the story? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the plot summary provided, Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), who is one of the six unruly prep school students forced to serve Saturday detention at Crestview Academy, does not survive until the end of the story. Earlier in the story, it is revealed that Megan is not just prissy, but she also suffers from asthma. Her condition becomes a plot device when her inhaler is hidden by Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), one of the other students in detention. Veronica, behaving mischievously, not only hides Megan's inhaler but also manipulates the situation to frame another student, Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato). This act leads to a fatal outcome for Megan. The lack of access to her inhaler when she needs it triggers a severe asthma attack, causing her to experience extreme shortage of breath. Due to this, Megan dies before her inhaler is found. Therefore, at the end of the story, Megan is no longer alive as a result of Veronica's sinister prank combined with the isolation of the students in the library. Thus, the answer to your question, \\"What happens to Megan at the end of the story?\\" is that she dies from an asthma attack after being denied access to her inhaler, a critical device for managing her condition."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation for u, we'll first simplify the equation to get terms involving 'u' together and constant terms together. Let's break down this process: The equation is 1397*u = -425*u - 8091 - 28349. Step 1: Combine like terms on the right hand side of the equation: This gives us 1397*u = -425*u - 36440. Step 2: We'll get all terms involving 'u' on one side of the equation and constants on the other side. In this case, we will add 425u to both sides of the equation in order to group terms with variable 'u' together: This gives us 1397*u + 425*u = -36440. Step 3: Simplify the left hand side of the equation, i.e., add the coefficients of 'u' together: This gives us 1822*u = -36440. Step 4: Now to solve for 'u', we'll divide both sides by 1822: This simplifies to u = -36440 / 1822. On solving the right hand side, we find that u is approximately -20. So, the solution to the equation is u = -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we conclude that \\"Charlie is very ungrateful.\\" if the statement \\"Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened.

However, to determine whether we can conclusively say, \\"Charlie is very ungrateful,\\" we must take into consideration the context, intentions of the speaker, and alternative explanations. Context plays a crucial role in understanding a statement. If the situation presented is isolated and there is no further information on Charlie's personality or other instances that demonstrate his level of gratitude, it would be inappropriate to conclude that he is \\"very ungrateful.\\" This claim might be based on the perception of the speaker or observed from a single instance in which Charlie did not express gratitude. On the other hand, if there is a pattern of Charlie consistently failing to show appreciation or acknowledgement for the help and support he receives, the conclusion that Charlie is very ungrateful might be more reasonable. The credibility and intentions of the speaker making the statement must also be considered. If the speaker has personal biases or their relationship with Charlie might influence their interpretation, we should remain cautious before reaching a firm conclusion. We should ideally gather more information and evaluate multiple perspectives before deciding whether Charlie is indeed ungrateful. Alternative explanations for Charlie's actions should be considered as well. For example, Charlie may be expressing gratitude in different ways that are less obvious or have a different personal style of showing appreciation. Cultural differences, personal history, and emotional factors may also play a role in determining how gratitude is demonstrated. Additionally, Charlie's behavior might be influenced by other circumstances unrelated to his gratitude, such as a misunderstanding or misconceptions about how his actions are perceived by others. In conclusion, while the statement \\"Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.\\" suggests that Charlie may be exhibiting ungrateful behavior, it is necessary to consider the broader context, intention of the speaker, and alternative explanations before reaching a definitive conclusion about Charlie's level of gratitude. It is essential to base such judgments on a thorough understanding of the individual's character and behavior, as well as objective evidence and perspectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First answer: In a hotel, there are many guests staying in different rooms. Having loud noises, like loud music or loud talking, can disturb other guests and make them unhappy or uncomfortable. So, having loud sex in a hotel might also disturb other people, and it's important to consider their feelings and be respectful. It's a good idea to try to be quiet when you're in a hotel so everyone can have a nice time. Second answer: People have different beliefs and opinions about what is right and what is wrong. Some people believe that marriages should only be between a man and a woman, so they speak up against same-sex marriages. Atheist marriages are when people get married without including a belief in God. People who don't like same-sex marriages might not have a problem with atheist marriages, or they might have different reasons for not speaking up about them.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! And, YES, I actually think it is better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Thoroughly believable and, perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features. However, I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated, yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character. Just think, he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as was revealed in the Q&A following Thursday night's screening). I can't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'.I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I won't start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour, graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero. Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and, although (and I did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence, the delectable humour, so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13. I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer. Available options: -- negative. -- positive.","completion":"The correct sentiment of the following review is: positive. Justification: The reviewer shares their enjoyment of the movie, compares it favorably to other films, praises the performances of the actors, and urges others to see the film and plans to buy the DVD themselves.

On the word \\"parable.\\" Translate to Czech","completion":"The word \\"parable\\" is translated into Czech as \\"podobenství.\\" A parable is a succinct story that illustrates a moral or religious lesson. It's a teaching tool that has been widely used in various societies and cultures. The Czech word for parable, \\"podobenství,\\" is used in a similar context. It is derived from the word \\"podobný,\\" meaning \\"similar.\\" In Czech culture, parables or \\"podobenství\\" are often used in religious contexts, as they are in many other cultures. The use of parables can be found in notable Czech literature - both recent and past. Great Czech writers such as Jan Werich and Karel Capek have used forms of \\"podobenství\\" in their works to emphasize the deeper meaning they wanted to convey. In Czech linguistic usage, \\"podobenství\\" tends to be utilized as a tool for teaching moral or ethical lessons in a metaphorical or indirect way. The nature of these lessons can cover many different areas, from religious to social to personal conduct. These stories serve as analogies, explaining complex concepts through simple narratives that readers can readily understand and relate to their personal life. A famous Czech \\"podobenství\\" is the story of \\"The Salt Over Gold\\" (\\"Sůl nad zlato\\"), a classic Czech fairytale. While not religious, it serves as an anecdotal lesson emphasizing the value of everyday commodities, such as salt, over luxuries like gold, underlining the importance of practicality and pragmatism. When translating more complex texts, especially religious texts like the Bible, it is particularly vital to understand the nuances and use of \\"podobenství\\" in Czech to translate accurately effectively. For instance, the parables of Jesus, an important element in Christian teachings, need to be translated with care to ensure that the deeper meanings are maintained in Czech. Remember, while the word \\"parable\\" directly translates to \\"podobenství,\\" the cultural, moral, and underlying context around these words may differ, so fully understanding and conveying the meaning is crucial during the translation process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by identifying unnecessary information and removing it. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression.

A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter. They decide to set explosives to block the fault's path. Later, when it reaches the park, Boomer detonates the explosives causing the fault to stop just short of reaching the volcano, but costing Boomer's life.

We may have a very unclear understanding of what makes a friend but we all want to have many good friends around us. There are certain steps that can win you friends or at least help you get close to those whom you want to make friends with. The first step to make friends with someone is to make him like you. If they don't like you in the beginning, it is impossible for them to become your friends. To let someone know that you're interested in him, a little smile and calling him by his name can help. To make the other person feel important, you need to be a good listener and encourage the other person to talk. Give your honest and real opinions but do not make fun of him or her. The second step is to fully understand each other. You need to share his or her opinions. So, it is necessary for you to develop a habit of seeing things from the other person's point of view .

At least one of the bugs landed on a city employee, and the assistant city manager was reduced to using Windex in an attempt to stun the bugs while pest control was on its way. Police were immediately called and found the unnamed man, WGME reports. Bridgeo filed a complaint against the man, but police have yet to decide if he'll be charged with anything. The man, who released the bedbugs in the city's General Assistance office, was apparently upset after requesting a form to get assistance and being told he didn't qualify. The bedbugs were reportedly from his former apartment. Augusta city hall was closed for the rest of the weekend. Bedbug-detecting dogs are expected to check for any remaining bugs Monday after pest control gets through with the building.","completion":"A long time ago, a man who was not very happy visited a big building called city hall in a place called Augusta, in Maine. This building is where people who work for the government help the people who live in the city. The man brought with him a cup full of tiny bugs called bedbugs. These bedbugs are very small, and they like to live in beds and bite people when they sleep. The man was unhappy because he didn't get the help he wanted from the people in the city hall. So, to show how unhappy he was, he opened the cup and let out all of the bedbugs! There were maybe around 100 of them. The people who worked there were very surprised and scared of the bugs, and they even tried to use a spray called Windex to make the bugs go away. Soon, some people who know how to deal with these bugs, called pest control, were called to the building to help. The city hall had to be closed for the rest of the weekend, so no one could go in until they were sure all of the bedbugs were gone. Even dogs who can smell the bedbugs were sent to check the building on Monday to make sure they were all gone.

Question: Where is someone looking for a job likely to find a computer? Options: A. department store B. desktop C. school D. space shuttle E. library Answer:","completion":"E. Library The most common sense option where someone looking for a job is likely to find a computer is at a library. Although computers can be found in various places, libraries are public spaces specifically designed for educational and research purposes, offering accessibility and technology to a broad range of people. This makes libraries a convenient location for job seekers to find and use computers in their quest for employment, while also providing additional resources for their job search such as books, articles, and workshops. Here's an overview of the options presented, explaining why they do not align with common sense as well as the library does: A. Department Store - While department stores can sell computers or laptops, their primary purpose is to sell various consumer products, not to provide a space where job seekers can use these devices for their search. Additionally, any computers in a department store are typically on display for sale and may not be available for extended use. B. Desktop - The term \\"desktop\\" refers to the user interface and visual layout of a computer, not a place where one could physically access a computer to use for job searching purposes. It does not align with common sense as it doesn't specify any location where a person would find a computer. C. School - Schools do have computers, and for students, they may be suitable places to look for a job. However, schools are not generally available to the public (unless it's a college or university with a public library) and primarily cater to the educational needs of their enrolled students. Thus, not every job seeker will have access to a school's facilities. D. Space Shuttle - This option is highly unrealistic and does not align with common sense in the context of job searching. Space shuttles are designated for astronauts engaged in space exploration missions, and computers on board are specifically designed for mission support, not for job searching. To sum it up, the most common sense option for someone looking to find a computer to search for a job is a library, which provides free access to technological resources and assistance for job seekers."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - Put the aluminum can into a recycle bin - The cans are transported to a facility - The cans are shredded by a machine - The cans are heated to 1400 degrees to melt them - The molten metal is poured into molds - The molds are flattened and rolled into sheets to reuse.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence \\"Политика - такая вещь, что ее внешние проявления могут ввести в заблуждение\\" translates to English as \\"Politics is such a thing that its outward manifestations can lead to misunderstandings.\\" Politics is a complex and nuanced discipline which is many times seen as mysterious by the general public. The outward manifestation of politics that the statement is referring to could be the public behaviors, decisions, and actions of political figures, parties, or even entire governments. Oftentimes, these outward manifestations are heavily influenced by numerous factors, including but not limited to, the pressure to adhere to party lines, the need to secure voter support, international diplomacy considerations, and an attempt to balance disparate interests within the society. These factors can often lead to actions or decisions that may seem confusing or even contradictory to the outside observer. For instance, a political party could take a seemingly contradictory position on certain issues in an attempt to appeal to a broad voter base. Or a politician might make certain promises during a campaign that they are later unable to fulfill due to practical limitations or opposition. Furthermore, the inherent nature of politics often involves a degree of negotiation and compromise, which can sometimes lead to policies that are seen as inconsistent or unclear. This serves to further add a layer of complexity and ambiguity to its outward manifestations. Thus, it's important for people to critically analyze and understand the underlying reasons, contexts, and factors influencing these outward manifestations in political affairs. We cannot judge political dynamics on the face of it, but rather we need to dive deeper, looking beyond what's manifested outside to really comprehend the complexities at play in politics. Just as we risk misunderstanding a novel if we were to judge it solely by its cover, we risk misunderstanding politics if we judge it by its outward manifestations without considering the larger, more complex picture. So, translating not just the words, but also the context, implications, and broader message of the Russian sentence means to understand that politics is a complex scenario where surface-level events or actions might not fully represent the underlying realities, hence causing misunderstandings."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who augmented boxwood carvings? ? Boxwood miniatures seemed to have served three original functions: aids to private devotion, luxury objects of status, and novel playthings. Later they became precious family heirlooms passed from generation to generation, but as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost. The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the dukes of Bavaria, which contain several boxwood miniatures.Of the surviving works, over one hundred re-emerged in the 19th century Parisian antiquarian market, then the leading market for medieval art. During this period, they were acquired by collectors such as the British collector Richard Wallace (1818–1890), who purchased Count van Nieuwerkerke's (1811–1892) entire collection, including two boxwood prayer nuts, the Vienna-born collector of objets d'art Frédéric Spitzer (1815−1890), and Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839–1898). Spitzer was not a purist and commissioned metalsmiths to produce modern versions, or copies, of a variety of medieval artworks. Today, there are four surviving boxwood carvings he had augmented for the market.When the American financier J. P. Morgan purchased Baron Albert Oppenheim's collection in 1906, he acquired four boxwood miniatures, including a triptych with the Crucifixion and Resurrection, and a prayer nut showing the Carrying of the Cross, all of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Canadian publishing magnate Kenneth Thomson was an important collector for over 50 years, and his collection included the world's largest gathering of boxwood miniatures, including two skulls, two triptychs, and six prayer beads. These were bequeathed to the Art Gallery of Ontario, along with three other works collected by his family after his death. Answer:","completion":"Frédéric"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: News Release October 5, 2018 Contact information Statement on cases of acute flaccid myelitis The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) issued the following statement today regarding reported cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in six children around the state over the last few weeks. AFM is a rare but potentially severe condition that can arise following an infection, and in some cases it can lead to death, paralysis or other long-term health impacts. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) is investigating six cases of a rare condition called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) that occurred since mid-September in Minnesota children. AFM is a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system, causing muscles to weaken. It can be a complication following a viral infection, but environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to its development. AFM symptoms include sudden muscle weakness in the arms or legs, sometimes following a respiratory illness. Other symptoms may include: Neck weakness or stiffness Drooping eyelids or a facial droop. Difficulty swallowing or slurred speech. MDH disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases. The department is also in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to share information. For reasons not fully understood, AFM affects mainly children. All recent Minnesota cases have been in children under 10 years old and all were hospitalized. Cases have been reported from the Twin Cities, central Minnesota and northeastern Minnesota. There was a national uptick in AFM cases in 2014. Disease investigators believe this was linked to an outbreak of a respiratory illness in children that was caused by a virus known as enterovirus D 68 (EVD68). Minnesota saw three AFM cases that year. Since then, we have typically seen less than one case a year. Since AFM can develop as a result of a viral infection, MDH recommends parents and children take basic steps to avoid infections and stay healthy: Wash your hands frequently to limit your exposure to germs. Cover your cough or sneeze. Stay home if you are sick. Stay up to date on vaccinations. Protect yourself and children from mosquito bites if you’re spending time outside. If parents see potential symptoms of AFM in their child, (for example, if he or she is not using an arm) they should contact their health care provider as soon as possible. AFM can be diagnosed by examining a person’s nervous system, taking an MRI scan and testing the cerebral spinal fluid. It is important that tests are done as soon as possible after someone develops symptoms. While there is no specific treatment for AFM, doctors may recommend certain interventions on a case-by-case basis. -MDH- Doug Schultz MDH Communications 651-201-4993 doug.schultz@state.mn.us ||||| State health officials have issued an alert to doctors after six Minnesota children were diagnosed with a rare, polio-like disorder that causes reduced mobility or paralysis in the arms and legs. All six cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) have been reported since Sep. 20, prompting the Minnesota Department of Health to ask doctors to be on the lookout for the disorder, which has severe consequences but mysterious origins. \\"It is very rare and it is certainly something we're taking very seriously,\\" said Kris Ehresmann, who directs the Health Department's infectious disease section. \\"It's a very devastating situation\\" for the children and their families, she said. The disease attacks the nervous system via the spinal cord, and may be transmitted by a virus. Symptoms usually include a sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle reflexes, but can also include drooping eyelids, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing. Treatment and therapy restores lost mobility in some children over time, but the syndrome can be fatal in those who lose the muscular function to breathe. James Hill of Lakeville said his son, Quinton, suffered typical cold symptoms at the start of one school week last month. By the end of the week, he was vomiting and stayed home. By the weekend, his left arm and neck had stiffened badly. Because the disorder is rare — afflicting less than one in a million children — doctors at Children's Hospital weren't considering it initially, Hill said. They conducted blood tests, imaging scans and a spinal tap to arrive at a diagnosis. Orville Young, 4, is one of the children who has suffered lost mobility or paralysis in Minnesota due to a rare condition known as AFM. The Minneapolis boy underwent stimulation therapy at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare in St. Paul to try to regain lost leg and arm function. \\"Super scary for us,\\" he said. \\"We had never heard of it. No one had ever heard it.\\" AFM came to the attention of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2014 after clusters of cases were discovered in Colorado and California and linked to the spread of a type of virus known as EV-D68. States have since reported 362 cases, some with no viral presence and some that seemed linked to other West Nile-type viruses. The six Minnesota children, all 10 and younger, were hospitalized due to their conditions. They come from the Twin Cities, central Minnesota and northeastern Minnesota. Several of the parents contacted the Star Tribune directly, hoping that news coverage would prompt parents to take precautions and doctors and hospitals to identify the condition quickly when they encounter it. Ehresmann said she hopes that closer study of the children — and any other cases uncovered through the latest alert to doctors — could uncover causes. \\"We're looking into any kind of commonality, but at this point … we don't have anything to wrap up in a bow,\\" she said. The cases aren't even verified by lab test results. Ehresmman said it's the \\"constellation of symptoms\\" that ties them together. Mario Bros. Elaine Young's 4-year-old son, Orville, was perhaps the first case in the Minnesota cluster. Last July he came down with typical cold symptoms, which quickly gave way to immobility in his legs and paralysis in his upper right arm. Limited muscular activity in his diaphragm also restricted his breathing, at first, which can be a fatal complication of AFM. Young said doctors delivered a diagnosis fairly rapidly — after initially ruling out a stroke — when she took Orville to the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, where a neurologist had written a paper on AFM. But confronting one of the first Minnesota cases, she had to find out what to do next on her own, she said, and found her way to Gillette Children's Specialty Services in St. Paul. Physical rehabilitation combined with electrical muscular stimulation there over the past two months helped Orville regain 90 percent of his leg function. The top half of his right arm remains immobile, though. \\"It definitely affected me and his father much more, emotionally, at least, because we can see into his future,\\" Young said. \\"When you're 4 … every time you wake up it's a big new change. So losing the use of your arm? He said: 'I can't give really good hugs anymore, but I'm doing all of my exercises!' \\" Orville still plays Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. video games, his favorites, because he has use of his right wrist and lower arm. Hill has seen some recovery in his son, even only a week after being hospitalized, with therapy at Gillette. Unable to move his upper left arm, Quinton drags it forward so he can reach Legos and build with both hands. The muscles on the left side of his face remain weak, making it hard to smile, blink and swallow. Both children are at risk for a complication known as subluxation, or the dislocation of their dormant arms, if they don't keep them moving. \\"Keep lefty involved with righty,\\" therapists tell Quinton. Three cases in 2014 While this is the largest cluster to be reported in Minnesota, it is not the first in the state. Minnesota had three cases in 2014, and single cases in some years since then. Nationally, most cases have been reported each year in September. In addition to viruses, health officials suspect the syndrome is linked to unknown genetic and environmental factors. Treatments include steroid medications and immunoglobulin infusions to boost the child's immune system. Most cases start with cold symptoms followed by loss of movement on one side of the body, and can be verified by imaging scans that detect inflammation in a central part of the spinal cord, said Dr. Anu Kalaskar, an infectious disease specialist at Children's. But treatment varies with each case, and has involved respiratory support for children struggling to breathe. The risk of transmission is low and can be further reduced by standard cold prevention practices such as washing hands and covering coughs, she said. The CDC has been collaborating with researchers to understand AFM, to estimate how many cases occurred before 2014, and to determine why cases increased substantially starting that year. Mehdi Ayouche's 5-year-old daughter, Sophia, is still hospitalized at Children's in Minneapolis. The Chanhassen father worries that lost mobility in her neck and right arm might make it hard for her to do the things she loves — from swimming and drawing to Tae Kwon Do. He is hopeful that therapy will help, and relieved that Sophia's twin brother and older sister did not get the syndrome, despite having cold symptoms. \\"We want to make people aware,\\" he said. \\"It is a rare condition. [When it occurs], people might not know what to do next.\\" ||||| Story highlights Acute flaccid myelitis, known as AFM, affects the body's nervous system Minnesota typically sees less than one case per year Thirty-eight cases of AFM have been confirms in the US in 2018, CDC says (CNN) Six children in Minnesota have been diagnosed with a rare \\"polio-like\\" disease since mid-September, state health officials said.

Really upset to give this a 1* review because I love going to smaller, less known places. I've eaten at Babbo a few times and have always had pretty good experiences, but my most recent experience has made me NEVER want to go back & make an effort to tell people not to go. First, we were seated right next to the blazing hot window. Sweat was literally pouring from our faces & we were fanning ourselves with the menus. We asked for a new table but were told it would be 20 minutes to be reseated, even though we watched several people get seated who had just walked in far less than 20 minutes. The manager even came by telling us we were sitting in the \\"hot seats\\" and that they were sorry that particular window didn't have tinting at the time. Seriously, WHY would you seat someone at a table you actually know is BLAZING hot? We ended up scrunching super close together on the miniscule portion of shade on the table just to get out of the sun. There were no air vents above us so we couldn't feel the air conditioning. We felt like little slaves huddled on what is known as the \\"hot\\" table while everyone else was relaxing under the air vents & shade. Must be nice to be on that side! Next, the server was the worst I have experienced, anywhere. We didn't even receive as much as a smile, just muttering asking what we wanted, acting like he was doing us a favor by taking our orders (I should add that although we were upset about the table, we tried to be friendly to the waiter; we know it wasn't his fault we were sitting there & weren't going to take that out on him). It also took us a really long time to get water refills...especially miserable since our table was so hot & we were all out of water. Now let's get to the food. When the side salads came, there was so much salad stuffed onto a small plate that the salad was literally flopping off of the sides and onto the table. It was also drenched in dressing & the combination of the salad falling off of the plate & swimming in dressing, it looked like the most unappetizing food I've ever seen. Since there was so much salad on the place, it was really hard to eat because most of it was just falling off of the plate & onto the table. When i was done I had to pick up most of the wasted salad & put it back on the plate. I should also add that the salad was a decent size for a side salad; it was just put onto a REALLY small plate. At this point it was just miserable. Food was falling everywhere, sweat kept dripping, and horrible service that was giving me a headache. We asked the manager to come back yet again and expressed our complaints about the heat & service, but the manager made no offer to make it better. I'm not the type to complain or ever try to get something in return, but I was surprised when our check came & we were charged the full price given the manager knew how upset we were and completely agreed with us about our horrible experience. I guess service is just going downhill, but if I was the manager I would have done everything in my power to turn the situation around and make my customers happy, even if it was as simple as offering us a new table or giving us a small discount on the meal we couldn't possibly enjoy or even want to take the time to eat with sweat dripping from our faces. Needless to say, the food is decent & I am very sad that their horrible service has ruined my liking of this restaurant. All it would have taken was a nice server or something other than the manger to simply 'agree' with us to completely turn this experience around. I will not support nor recommend this practice of business.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Note 1: If a player's Playing Handicap is negative (a so-called \`\`Plus'' Playing Handicap) he gives Handicap Strokes to the course, commencing at stroke index 18. Is it true that can you have a negative handicap in golf?","completion":"Yes, it is true that a golfer can have a negative handicap in golf, which is referred to as a \\"plus handicap\\" or a \\"plus golfer.\\" A negative handicap, or a plus handicap, is an indication of an extremely skilled golfer whose consistent performance is better than the standard scratch score (the score expected from a scratch golfer at a particular course). In the golf handicap system, golfers are assigned a handicap index, which allows players of differing skill levels to compete fairly against one another. The handicap index is a number that represents the average difference between a player's adjusted gross scores and the course rating on an 18-hole course. A positive or higher handicap indicates that a player performs higher (worse) than the standard scratch score. On the other hand, a negative or plus handicap means that the player performs lower (better) than the scratch score on average. When a plus golfer participates in a handicap event, they give rather than receive strokes to the course, which means they have fewer strokes to work within the competition. For instance, if a golfer has a playing handicap of -2, it effectively means their performance of two strokes better than their official scratch score on the golf course. In this case, they must give or add two strokes to their total score when competing against other players with positive handicaps. To determine the playing handicap, several factors must be taken into account, such as the player's handicap index, the course rating, and the slope rating. The specific formula for the playing handicap calculation depends on the governing body that administers the handicap system. For example, the World Handicap System (WHS) has been implemented by various golf governing bodies like the United States Golf Association (USGA) and The R&A since 2020, merging several different handicap systems into one unified process. In conclusion, it is possible for a golfer to have a negative handicap, indicating exceptional skill and consistent performance better than the scratch score. These players, also known as plus golfers, are subject to providing extra strokes to the course during handicap events, thereby leveling the playing field against competitors with positive handicaps."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke.

He found that increased depletion of Earth's ozone layer is a relatively new phenomenon. Most scientists would blame the CFC gases for the depletion of ozone layer. In the early twentieth century ozone layer was relatively stable. Bob labeled that time as time A. But in the late twentieth century situation changed with seasonal depletion of ozone layer. He labeled that time as time B. But I can use this background: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality. What is an answer for this question: In time A would less or more fish DNA be damaged than in time B?

Even when the other person has moved on, you may find yourself imagining a whole slew of “what if” scenarios; however, remind yourself that there are likely also many reasons that it didn't work out. Reflect on how you felt when you were dating. Often, we look back on past relationships through rose-colored glasses. You may have even been questioning the relationship yourself. Accept that she has moved on. You may have been holding out hope that things would work out between the two of you and you might have another shot at love with your ex. It may be painful to let go of that dream, but you can take her marriage as a definitive answer to any of your lingering questions: your romantic relationship is over. Even if you weren't convinced it was meant to be, it still hurts to be the one who is left behind. Remind yourself, however, that you're likely feeling drawn to her in part because of her sudden increased distance. Everyone always has a list of things they want to spend more time on, try out, or grow more familiar with. Choose one or two activities you want to try or do more frequently. For instance, start hitting the gym three times a week instead of just once. Alternatively, pick up a new hobby altogether. Try to choose something active and something creative. You can interpret these as broadly as you wish. The point is, staying active will literally help your body and mind feel better, and having a creative outlet can provide a powerful way to express your emotions. For example, yoga or guided meditation can not only make you feel great, it will also likely lead you to meet new people. Simple, weekly activities can open up door to whole new friend groups and lifestyles! Maybe you've always wanted to play guitar. Here's your chance! You can probably even find people to learn and practice with by contacting local music stores or searching online. The classic example is a vacation. Start and email or group text thread with a group of your friends and pitch some ideas for a weekend trip. Choose somewhere relatively nearby so it will be easier and less expensive for people to commit. Pick a weekend a month or so ahead of time. This ensures you and others can prepare for the trip, and will give you something to look forward to for the next month! If you can't escape for a trip, make plans to have friends over next weekend, just to hang out. There's nothing like a video game marathon to distract you for a while and help you relax. Sometimes a rude awakening can be exactly what we need. Use your new found freedom to refocus on your goals. When you catch yourself thinking about her, distract yourself immediately. Choose a goal you want to achieve, and whenever she comes to mind, think of something you can do to help achieve that goal and get to work. If you're looking for a new goal, consider meeting someone new. Instead of just waiting to meet someone, start introducing yourself to people you're attracted to more frequently. This may be especially easy at events that have to do with something you enjoy. Some of the scarier aspects of enduring a romantic partner marrying someone else are the different forms of self-doubt that will inevitably arise. You may find yourself questioning your ability to trust someone again, or to maintain a romantic relationship. Nip these doubts in the bud by dating someone else. Take advantage of your new found freedom! This doesn't mean you have to jump into anything serious. In fact, you shouldn't. That said, you should definitely introduce yourself to that cute barista you're always happy to see. If you are feeling betrayed and find it difficult to trust enough to start dating, take some time to work on coping with your emotions and learning to trust again.

When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but usually supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica. Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, sp3-hybridized silicon atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate minerals. Many ceramics are composed of silicates. By including small amounts of other compounds, it is possible to modify the physical properties of the silicate materials to produce ceramics with useful characteristics.

Ashley Pirlot, 26, is facing a maximum penalty of nearly eight years in prison if convicted. According to a criminal complaint, Cudahy Police were called to the Kmart for three small children left alone in the car last Friday. The car was unlocked and it was 35 degrees out when the children were found. Pirlot, the children’s mother was found in the store. When asked why she didn’t bring the children in with her, she said she “couldn’t fit all the kids in the shopping cart and she did not want to deal with seat belts and the kids running around the store.” Pirlot said she was in the store for seven or eight minutes. Police said surveillance footage showed she was in the store for about 17 minutes before she came up to the officers. She also said when she was a child, her mother was arrested for leaving Pirlot and her sister in a car while she watched a Packers game. ||||| Police lights (Photo: File) A South Milwaukee woman charged with leaving her three young children alone in a car while she shopped at Kmart told police her mother had been arrested for doing the same thing when she was a child. Ashley L. Pirlot, 26, was arrested Nov. 16 after two women called police when they saw the kids alone inside a car in the parking lot of Kmart in Cudahy. She was charged with three counts of neglect of a child. Two counts are felonies and the third is a misdemeanor. According to the criminal complaint: A 17-month-old girl was found in a booster seat wearing a pajama onesie partially unzipped in outside temperatures of 35 degrees. A 6 1/2-month-old girl was in an infant carrier with a blanket though her bare feet were sticking out from the blanket and a plastic bag within reach posed a choking hazard. A girl who had turned 6 the day before her mother's arrest told police she was hungry and had not eaten in awhile. Cudahy officers noticed the younger children's diapers were dirty. Police paged Pirlot inside Kmart and she told them she asked the 6-year-old girl to watch her sisters because she couldn't fit all three in a shopping cart and didn't want to deal with seat belting the kids in a cart. Pirlot told officers that her mother had been arrested for leaving her in a vehicle when she was a baby while her mother watched a Packers game. Pirlot said she thought she had been inside the store for seven or eight minutes before police paged her. Surveillance video showed Pirlot was in Kmart for approximately 17 minutes before police arrived. When Cudahy police noticed there were no diapers, formula, food or drink cups in the car for the children, they purchased diapers for Pirlot's two youngest daughters and provided them with food and water.

Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Problem:eq { count { filter_eq { all_rows ; score ; 1-0 } } ; 3 } Solution:","completion":"The given command can be broken down as follows: 1. filter_eq { all_rows ; score ; 1-0 }: This operation filters the rows of the table with a score equal to 1-0 (i.e., 1). 2. count { filter_eq { all_rows ; score ; 1-0 } }: This operation counts the number of rows that resulted from the previous filtering. 3. eq { count { filter_eq { all_rows ; score ; 1-0 } } ; 3 }: This operation checks if the count of rows obtained from the previous step is equal to 3. The command's purpose is to determine whether there are exactly three rows in the table with a score of 1. Since it deals with counting specific rows based on a value in one column, this command falls into the \\"count\\" category (Number 6)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three. answer the following question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair?

Please answer a question about the following article about Zinc: The name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as \\"zincum\\" or \\"zinken\\" in his book Liber Mineralium II, in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German zinke, and supposedly meant \\"tooth-like, pointed or jagged\\" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). Zink could also imply \\"tin-like\\" because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin. Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word سنگ seng meaning stone. The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego, calamine, and spinter.

While it might be true that she could be going to a Zumba class, there is not enough information in the provided statement to draw that conclusion. Zumba is a form of dance-based exercise, and many participants may wear casual clothing and bring sunglasses to the classes. However, these aspects are not exclusive to Zumba and are common in many outdoor and physical activities. If we were to analyze the provided statement, we could deduce the following information: 1. The individual is female. 2. She is wearing a red shirt. 3. She has sunglasses on top of her head. None of these attributes specifically point towards the woman attending a Zumba class. For example, some more definitive information might include: 1. The woman is wearing Zumba branded clothing. 2. She is carrying a Zumba class membership card or is located near a Zumba class venue. 3. She regularly attends Zumba classes, as mentioned in a previous statement. In the absence of specific information that connects the woman to Zumba, it is illogical to assume a direct relation between the two. We can only make an assessment based on probabilities, but it cannot be guaranteed or logically proven.

The episode has sparked speculation that the disgraced former NBA owner is back together with his ex-assistant. When Shelly learned of the tryst she told Beverly Hills police that Stiviano had broken into Donald’s home. Scroll down for video. Donald Sterling’s wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that V.Stiviano (right, with Sterling) was at his Beverly Hills mansion yesterday. Shelly (left) had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, 240,000 in cash and a 1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills. However, police were told by Donald that the model was an ‘invited guest’, according to TMZ and she stayed in the property after they left. In August Stiviano claimed that the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his 'beard' so no one would suspect his true sexuality. Stiviano, who gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling, made the bombshell allegation in documents filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court in answer to a prior lawsuit filed by Sterling’s wife, Shelly. In her original lawsuit, Shelly had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, 240,000 in cash and a 1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for sexual favors. Stiviano denies those allegations and even claims that Shelly Sterling was well aware of the exact nature of the relationship between Donald Sterling and Stiviano. ‘V.S. was D.T.S’s beard for three years prior to the filing of suit,’ the answer claimed. Stiviano gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling. ‘V.S. is informed and believes that (Sterling) is a homosexual and enjoys sexual acts and or sexual congress with males.’ The answer said that Shelly Sterling was ‘acutely aware of his orientation and condoned’ his behavior, including his decision to give ‘gifts, money and other properties’ to Stiviano for her public companionship, reports the Daily News. Stiviano also says that she ‘was not ever a sexual partner’ of Donald Sterling. She also states that the gifts are considered separate property, not 'marital or community property,' because they were purchased with funds earned by Donald after separation or 'estrangement' from her wife. Stiviano also filed a 10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday. She claims they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald. 'She’s delusional,’ Sterling’s lawyer, Max Blecher, told The Daily News. The drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling berating Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him 2.5 million. Shelly, his wife of 58 years, then took control of a family trust and negotiated a record 2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Shelly Sterling said she was initially given her husband's blessing to sell the team and he praised the deal she reached. When it came time to sign it at the end of May, however, Sterling said he would not sell and would sue the league. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers at the end of August. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Brian Wayne Transeau (born October 4, 1971), better known by his stage name BT, is an American music producer, composer, technologist, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. An artist in the electronica music genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the trance and intelligent dance music styles that paved the way for EDM, and for \\"stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.\\" He also creates music within many other styles, such as classical, film composition and bass music. BT is also known for pioneering the stutter edit. In the early years of BT's career, he became a pioneering artist in the trance genre, this despite the fact that he doesn't consider himself a DJ, since he infrequently spins records and comes from an eclectic music background. He was creating trance music before it was known by that name. When he started out, such common elements as a build, breakdown and drop were unclassified. BT's was a unique interpretation of what electronic music could be. His first trance recordings, \\"A Moment of Truth\\" and \\"Relativity\\", became hits in dance clubs in the UK. His productions were not yet popular in the US, and he was initially unaware that he had become popular across the Atlantic, where UK DJs like Sasha were regularly spinning his music for crowds. Sasha bought BT a ticket to London, where BT witnessed his own success in the clubs, with several thousand clubbers responding dramatically when Sasha played BT's song. He also met Paul Oakenfold, playing him tracks that would make up his first album. He was quickly signed to Oakenfold's record label, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers. BT's 1995 debut album Ima, released on Oakenfold's label, was a progressive house effort. The opening track, \\"Nocturnal Transmission\\", was featured in The Fast and the Furious. The album also featured a song with Vincent Covello. Blending house beats with sweeping New Age sounds, Ima helped to create the trance sound. \\"Ima (Jin )\\" is the Japanese word for \\"now\\". BT has stated that it also means many other things and that the intention of the album is to have a different effect for everyone. Following the release of Ima, BT began traveling to England regularly. It was during this time that he met Tori Amos. They would collaborate on his song \\"Blue Skies\\", which reached the number one spot on Billboard magazine's Dance Club Songs chart in January 1997. This track helped expand BT's notability beyond Europe, into North America. He soon began to produce songs for well-known artists such as Sting, Madonna, Seal, Sarah McLachlan, NSYNC, Britney Spears, Diana Ross and Mike Oldfield. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is there anything else significant about this?","completion":"One significant aspect from the above article is that BT is not only a pioneer in the trance and intelligent dance music styles, but he has also collaborated with many well-known artists such as Sting, Madonna, Seal, Sarah McLachlan, NSYNC, Britney Spears, Diana Ross, and Mike Oldfield.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation -316*q + 327*q - 125 = 62 for q, we will first combine the like terms in the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms In the equation, there are two terms with the variable 'q': -316*q and 327*q. We need to combine them before moving forward to solve the equation. (-316*q) + (327*q) = 327*q - 316*q = 11*q Now our new equation becomes: 11*q - 125 = 62 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable 'q' In order to find the value of 'q', we need to isolate it. To do this, we'll start by moving the constant term -125 to the other side of the equation. 11*q - 125 + 125 = 62 + 125 11*q = 187 Step 3: Solve for 'q' Now, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 11 to find the value of 'q': 11*q = 187 (11*q) / 11 = 187 / 11 q = 17 Thus, the solution to the equation -316*q + 327*q - 125 = 62 for q is q = 17."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security. This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) \\"This isn't some newspaper story, this is real\\" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing. The pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it. With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak. OPTIONS: A). negative B). positive","completion":"B). positive The review discusses various aspects of the film that the reviewer appreciates, such as the intense action, pacing, storyline, and intelligent examination of national security decisions.

Paragraph: You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

When thinking about which of the remaining topics most interest you, consider things that overlap with your skills and hobbies, your future career, social or political areas of concern, or academic areas of strength.. If you have to do a history project on the United States in the nineteenth century, for example, and you plan to work in government, then you might choose an area such as “the Women’s Suffrage Movement.” Or if you need to do a project for photography class and you enjoy visiting the city, you might choose an area such as “urban renewal.” If none of the topics on your list seems genuinely interesting, think about how some of them can be tweaked or revised so that they more fully reflect your interests, strengths, areas you’d like to improve in, etc. Reading about your selected area online or in the library will help you to get a sense of the subject or field. It will also give you an idea of what’s already out there and what’s been done, what kind of ideas you can build on, etc. It’s important to do some research on the general area you’ve chosen before committing to a very specific topic. This way you can have a firm sense of what’s out there in terms of resources and the range of information. Though you start broad, eventually, you will want to narrow your topic down to a workable size. How specific you get will, of course, depend on the specific assignment you have been given by your teacher and your grade level, but you can’t expect to do a project about ALL of Antarctica in 2 days’ time. It’s important to avoid project topics that are too broad and general because you will never be able to satisfyingly cover all of the relevant information, read all of the relevant sources, and so on. It’s much better to provide a detailed look at a smaller subject, something that you can speak or write (or draw) about in depth. Again, go back to your assignment sheet to determine how specific your topic should be. Your teacher may have even provided example topics that you can compare your idea against. If so, you should definitely use the examples as a guide!

Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived.

News article: Action Points Confusional arousals, also known as sleep drunkenness or severe sleep inertia, consist of mental confusion or confusional behavior during or following arousals from sleep. For the majority of subjects experiencing confusional arousals, no medications were used, but sleep and/or mental disorders were important factors. So-called confusional arousals -- awakenings without coming fully aware -- were reported in the past year by some 15% of respondents in a population-based survey, with nearly all such episodes associated with mental disorders or drugs known to affect sleep, researchers said. But 0.9% of the sample reported episodes that could not be attributed to other conditions, and who therefore could qualify for a diagnosis of a primary confusional arousal disorder, according to Maurice Ohayon, MD, DSc, PhD, of Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and colleagues. And, contrary to what might have been expected, most episodes were unrelated to sleep-inducers such as zolpidem (Ambien) or eszopiclone (Lunesta), the researchers reported in the Aug. 26 issue of Neurology. After adjusting for other risk factors, use of hypnotic drugs was not significantly associated with confusional arousals. In fact, medication use of any kind was present in only a minority of respondents with episodes. Several psychiatric disorders were associated with episodes, including dysthymic disorder (47.4% of respondents with episodes), bipolar disorders (42.3%), and panic disorder (40.4%). In addition, many types of sleep disorders appeared to raise the risk for the episodes. Confusional arousals -- also known as sleep drunkenness or severe sleep inertia -- are episodes during which a person awakened from sleep is confused as to time and place and may engage in hostile or violent behaviors, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It often occurs when someone is shaken awake early in the ordinary sleep cycle, but can also present upon normal awakening at the end of a full night's sleep. Michael Thorpy, MD, head of the Montefiore Medical Center's Sleep-Wake Disorders Center in Bronx, N.Y., told MedPage Today that it's a significant problem for some people that deserves investigation and, in some cases, direct treatment. They occur \\"when sleep processes are not disengaging\\" when a person is otherwise coming awake. This most often happens when the patient's brain was deep in sleep, especially the slow-wave type, and some other process -- another person or an internal event -- acts to awaken the patient. Another specialist, Harly Greenberg, of the North Shore-LIJ Sleep Disorders Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., stressed that, in patients whose episodes arise from an underlying condition, \\"identification of the comorbid disorder is important.\\" Ohayon and colleagues noted that the syndrome has not received much attention in epidemiological studies. Hence they conducted their own. Episode Characteristics With funding from the Arrillaga Foundation, the researchers contacted more than 19,000 adults by telephone, completing interviews with about 16,000. Respondents ranged in age from 18 to 102 and 51% were women. About 20% were currently working evenings or nights; 40% worked during the day. Among respondents, 2,421 (15.2%) indicated that they had experienced at least one episode during the past year. Of these, just over half said the frequency was at least once weekly, and another 25% reported two to five episodes per month. For most participants, the episodes had been coming a long time. Some 56% said they began more than 5 years ago and 26% indicated that they had occurred for 1-5 years. Reported durations of individual episodes averaged less than 5 minutes for about one-third of respondents; another third said they typically lasted 5-15 minutes, and the remainder reported average durations exceeding 15 minutes. Common features of episodes were as follows: Temporospatial disorientation: 57% Difficulty speaking or thinking clearly: 34% Confused behaviors: 20% Hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations: 36% Nocturnal wandering: 15% No memory of episodes: 9% Among participants reporting nocturnal wandering, almost half -- 46% -- said they had violent behaviors as part of such episodes. Thorpy said that confused behaviors range from mistaking a bedside water bottle for a telephone -- thereby dousing themselves when they attempt to answer it -- to urinating in a closet thinking that it's a toilet. Associations Ohayon and colleagues asked participants about other sleep problems, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and medications they were taking. Having other sleep disorders was a clear risk factor for confusional arousal episodes. In adjusted analyses, respondents showing presence of the following disorders had the indicated odds ratios for reporting episodes: Excessive sleepiness: OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.68-2.13) Circadian rhythm sleep disorder: OR 2.85 (95% CI 2.33-3.48) Obstructive sleep apnea: OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.44-2.22) Restless legs syndrome: OR 1.61 (95% CI 1.26-2.06) Insomnia: OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.55-2.25) Hypersomnia: OR 2.40 (95% CI 1.41-4.09) Overall, participants with a sleep disorder were about three times as likely to report confusional arousals as those without any such conditions. Several types of psychiatric disorders also showed significant associations with episodes. These included alcohol abuse and dependence, post-traumatic stress, depression, and certain anxiety disorders. Although the latter included generalized anxiety and panic disorders, some related conditions did not show significant associations after adjusting for other factors. In this category were agoraphobia, social anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. With regard to medications, the class most strongly associated with episodes was antidepressants. Selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, tetracyclics, and other types were each associated with about double the risk of showing confusional arousals. Hypnotics, anti-anxiety drugs and all other psychotropics lumped together had no association with the episodes in the adjusted analyses. Two-thirds of respondents reporting episodes denied using any psychotropic or sleep medications. Limitations to the study included reliance on respondents' self-reports for all data. Ohayon and colleagues noted that confusional arousals do not have objective measures, and the presence of amnesia and confusion is likely to lead to under- or misreporting. They also indicated that confusional arousals are not currently recognized as a diagnosable illness and may not be pathological. On the other hand, they suggested, \\"including confusional arousals as a sleep disorder in the major classifications would increase awareness among physicians and patients and contribute to its identification, research, and treatment.\\" Rundo told MedPage Today that the newest classification of sleep disorders, ICSD-3, which came out after the current study was submitted, does include confusional arousals in its listing of abnormal states. Thorpy said that confusional arousals may indicate an underlying problem that deserves attention, such as sleep apnea or a seizure disorder. For the few patients with no apparent cause for the arousals, medications such as benzodiazepines that shorten the slow-wave cycle may be used, he said. Greenberg said that treatment may be called for \\"if the bouts occur frequently and are disturbing.\\" He also suggested that, even when they seem benign, \\"discussion of the nature of the events ... can be reassuring.\\" Beth Ann Malow, MD, director of Vanderbilt University’s Sleep Disorders Center in Nashville, commented in an email that, while most people may be disoriented momentarily on sudden awakening, the “confusional arousals” designation is not medicalizing a normal behavior. \\"Many behaviors, especially in the field of sleep and neurology, exists on a continuum and within the realm of normal. The key is not to say that someone with confusional arousals is having ‘abnormal behavior’ but instead to help them understand what they are experiencing is (a) common, (b) not strange or bizarre, and (c) potentially related to an underlying cause that needs to be addressed (e.g., sleep apnea),\\" she said. The study was funded by the Arrillaga Foundation. Study authors declared they had no relevant financial interests. Reviewed by Zalman S.

The episodes usually happen when a person is woken suddenly, and people sometimes have no memory of these incidents, said Dr. Maurice Ohayon, a sleep psychiatrist at Stanford School of Medicine and co-author of the study, detailed today (Aug. 25) in the journal Neurology. [Top 10 Spooky Sleep Disorders] \\"It's like they are totally drunk — they don't know where they are or what they are doing,\\" Ohayon told Live Science. Confusional arousal is distinct from night terrors and sleepwalking, Ohayon said. It is often seen in children, but has not been well studied in adults. In the study, the researchers interviewed a random sample of more than 19,000 American adults about their sleep habits and history of confusional arousal, as well as any mental illness and any medications they were taking. About 15 percent of those surveyed said they had experienced at least one bout of this \\"sleep drunkenness\\" in the previous year, more than half of whom said they suffered at least one episode per week. Slightly fewer than 10 percent of those who had had an episode couldn't remember part or all of the experience, and 15 percent of them also had sleepwalking episodes. Confusional arousal is different from the normal sleepiness that most people feel when they wake up, said Dr. Alan Manevitz, a clinical psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York who was not involved with the research. Most people with sleep grogginess generally remember their experience, but people with sleep drunkenness are not aware of their actions, and attempts to fully wake them usually fail, Manevitz told Live Science. The unusual grogginess has many different causes, depending on the individual. The researchers found that among those who'd had an episode of sleep drunkenness, 70 percent also had a sleep disorder, and 37 percent had a mental illness. Only 31 percent were taking medication for these disorders, and these were mostly antidepressants. People suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, panic or post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety seemed more susceptible to the disorder, as did those with sleep apnea, a disorder in which a person briefly stops breathing during sleep, the researchers said. Confusional arousal can also result from getting too little or too much sleep, the researchers noted. In the study, about 20 percent of people who reported getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night reported having an episode, and 15 percent of those who got at least 9 hours per night said the same, the researchers said. The prevalence of sleep drunkenness may be cause for concern, Ohayon said. The disorder could have major consequences if it affects people with responsibility for the safety and security of others, such as pilots or emergency-room doctors, he said.

Original article on Live Science. ||||| Have you ever answered the phone in the morning to discover it was actually your alarm clock going off, or had a conversation in the middle of the night and woken up the next day with no recollection of it? A new study suggests you are not alone. Researchers found many of us have had a similar experience in our lifetime. The study, out Monday in the journal Neurology, says one in every seven people suffer from sleep \\"drunkenness\\" disorder, also called confusional arousal. Confusional arousal is when a person wakes up and remains in a confused state for a certain period of time before either going back to sleep or fully waking up. These episodes typically happen, according to the National Institutes of Health, when someone is awakened during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is a deeper sleep period. And they're usually triggered by a forced awakening, like an alarm or phone call. The study authors had more than 19,000 adults fill out a survey about their sleeping habits. They found 15.2% of the participants experienced one episode of confusional arousal during the past year. Dr. Maurice Ohayon, lead study author and a sleep expert at Stanford University, was surprised by the substantial percentage. When he looked carefully, he says, he found over half of these participants have \\"confusional arousal one time or more a week, and that is considerable.\\" What's even more interesting, says Ohayon, is how long confusional arousal seems to last. While more than one third of the participants who experienced episodes once a week reported they lasted under 5 minutes, 32.3% of people said their episodes lasted between 5 and 15 minutes and 30% of people experienced episodes lasting 15 minutes or more. If someone is experiencing these episodes, they need to let their doctors know, says Ohayon. An episode can cause violent behavior during sleep, according to the study. \\"You can hurt yourself physically, hurt someone (else). You wake up irritable and possibly violent.\\" He compares it to waking up in a hotel room - you don't know where you are or what hour it is, so your reaction or responses to the environment are not adapted. Ohayon says shift workers, such as doctors or pilots, who nap during work and can be awakened suddenly, should block at least 15 minutes of time for their bodies to truly wake up before, say, taking command of a plane or making life-or-death decisions. The study found that 84% of those with sleep drunkenness disorder also had another sleep disorder, a mental health disorder or were taking psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants. Less than 1% of the people with sleep drunkenness had no known cause or related condition. Dr. David Alexander Schulman, director of the sleep lab at Emory University in Atlanta, says having these episodes isn't uncommon. \\"Fifteen percent sounds shocking,\\" but when you think about it, most of us have had these type experiences. One of the things that can make confusion arousal worse is sleep deprivation. Schulman says it's well known that American's don't sleep enough. \\"If you are getting less than 6 hours a night, and you are having confusional arousal, then the first thing you need to do is try getting more sleep,\\" he says. Schulman was skeptical of the number of participants whose episodes lasted more than 15 minutes. While he says these episodes can be common and often funny, most people don't continue to talk into the phone for 15 minutes when their alarm clock is going off. \\"I'd be surprised if the episode lasted more than 15 minutes,\\" he said. \\"That's one of the struggles with a subjective survey.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Confusional arousals, also known as sleep drunkenness or severe sleep inertia, are episodes during which a person awakened from sleep is confused as to time and place and may engage in hostile or violent behaviors.

Digital distribution of movies has the potential to save money for film distributors. To print an 80-minute feature film can cost US1,500 to 2,500, so making thousands of prints for a wide-release movie can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, at the maximum 250 megabit-per-second data rate (as defined by Digital Cinema Initiatives for digital cinema), a feature-length movie can be stored on an Commercial off-the-shelf 300 Gigabyte hard drive for 50 and a broad release of 4000 digital prints might cost 200,000. In addition hard drives can be returned to distributors for reuse. With several hundred movies distributed every year, the industry saves billions of dollars. The digital-cinema roll-out was stalled by the slow pace at which exhibitors acquired digital projectors, since the savings would be seen not by themselves but by distribution companies. The Virtual Print Fee model was created to address this by passing some of the saving on to the cinemas. As a consequence of the rapid conversion to digital projection, the number of theatrical releases exhibited on film is dwindling. As of 4 May 2014, 37,711 screens (out of a total of 40,048 screens) in the United States have been converted to digital, 3,013 screens in Canada have been converted, and 79,043 screens internationally have been converted.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)? Context: The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a breed of dog from Phú Quốc Island in Vietnam's southern Kiên Giang Province. The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is one of only three breeds that has a ridge of hair that runs along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of the coat (the others are Rhodesian Ridgeback and Thai Ridgeback). The Phu Quoc is the smallest of the three ridgeback breeds. Hypothesis: The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Rhodesian ridgeback *Yes *It's impossible to say *No","completion":"It's impossible to say definitively if the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Rhodesian Ridgeback based solely on the provided context. While both breeds share a common feature, which is the ridge of hair along their backs, the context does not provide any information about their genetic connections or if they are related through historical crossbreeding. The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is described as originating from Phú Quốc Island in Vietnam, whereas the Rhodesian Ridgeback comes from Southern Africa. The geographic separation of these breeds points to the possibility that they may have evolved independently from one another. However, without additional information on their genetic makeup or instances of crossbreeding in their lineages, we cannot draw a solid conclusion on whether or not the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Moreover, the fact that the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is the smallest of the three ridgeback breeds does not necessarily indicate that it is a crossbreed. It is entirely possible for similar traits to emerge in separate breeds without a direct genetic connection. The convergent evolution phenomenon can result in unrelated organisms developing similar traits due to similar environmental pressures, rather than a shared ancestor. In conclusion, based on the given context, it is impossible to say for certain if the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Rhodesian Ridgeback. A comprehensive genetic analysis or investigation of their breeding history would be required to provide stronger evidence for or against this hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A man wearing a blue jacket jumping from one concrete wall to the other.\\", can we conclude \\"A man is standing still next to a concrete wall.\\"?","completion":"Based on the statement, \\"A man wearing a blue jacket jumping from one concrete wall to the other,\\" we cannot simply conclude that \\"A man is standing still next to a concrete wall.\\" However, we can provide an in-depth analysis to understand the differences in the scenarios and what additional information may be needed to reach a certain conclusion. First, let's break down the information in the initial statement: 1. A man is involved in the scenario. 2. The man is wearing a blue jacket. 3. The man is jumping from one concrete wall to another. Now, let's compare this information to the proposed conclusion which states, \\"A man is standing still next to a concrete wall.\\" In the proposed conclusion: 1. A man is involved in the scenario. 2. The man is standing still. 3. The man is next to a concrete wall. From this analysis, we observe that while both statements mention a man and a concrete wall, the actions and other details differ between the scenarios. Specifically, the initial statement describes a man in motion (jumping), whereas the proposed conclusion describes a man who is stationary (standing still). Additionally, the details of the man's clothing (wearing a blue jacket) and the presence of two concrete walls in the initial statement are absent in the proposed conclusion. To connect the two scenarios, additional information would be required. For example, if the statement mentioned that the man wearing a blue jacket eventually stopped jumping and stood still next to the concrete wall, then we could logically draw this conclusion. However, without this added context, we cannot simply conclude that \\"A man is standing still next to a concrete wall\\" based on the initial statement. In conclusion, although both scenarios involve a man and a concrete wall, the differences in actions and other descriptive details make it impossible to directly conclude \\"A man is standing still next to a concrete wall\\" from the original statement \\"A man wearing a blue jacket jumping from one concrete wall to the other.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This rapid growth can be attributed to a variety of factors, including economic development, job opportunities, natural resources, or technological advancements. For example, a city might experience growth because it is located near a newly discovered oil reserve, or because it has become a hub for cutting-edge technology research and development. Additionally, the statement \\"the fastest-growing, most rapidly changing metropolis\\" emphasizes not only the speed at which the area is growing, but also the significant degree of change taking place within the region. This might suggest that the metropolis is undergoing a rapid transformation in terms of its infrastructure, industry, or culture. This type of growth and change can have wide-ranging implications for the city's residents, as well as for the broader region and the country as a whole.

Answer:","completion":"The Stephen Sondheim musical 'Sunday in the Park with George' was inspired by a painting by the renowned French artist Georges Seurat. Seurat, born on December 2, 1859, and died on March 29, 1891, was a post-Impressionist painter and draftsman known for his innovative approach to art. He played a crucial role in the development of 19th-century art by devising a technique that came to be known as Pointillism, also referred to as Divisionism or Chromoluminarism. This technique is characterized by the application of small, discrete dots and brushstrokes of pure color, which visually blend together when viewed from a distance. 'Sunday in the Park with George' is a two-act musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Lapine. The musical was inspired by Seurat's most famous painting, 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.' This painting, completed in 1884-1886, is an excellent example of Pointillism and is considered one of the most significant and enduring works of the movement. It is currently housed in the Art Institute of Chicago. The painting features a bustling scene depicting Parisians enjoying a leisurely Sunday afternoon in a park on the Seine River's bank. The artist's unique use of color and attention to detail captures the essence of a typical French weekend activity of the time. The musical 'Sunday in the Park with George' premiered on Broadway in 1984 and was met with critical and commercial success. It won several accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1985, solidifying its place as a beloved and highly regarded piece of American musical theater. The story revolves around the fictionalized life of Georges Seurat as he struggles to complete the painting while navigating the complexities of his personal life. Alongside this narrative, the musical also delves into themes such as artistic vision, human connection, and the fine line between reality and imagination. The second act of 'Sunday in the Park with George' is set a century later, following the life of George, Seurat's great-grandson, who is also an artist. This act draws connections between the two artists and explores the lasting impact of Seurat's work and habits in the contemporary art world. As a tribute to Seurat's style, the musical itself is rich in visual elements, including costumes, set design, and staging, all inspired by the original painting. In conclusion, the Stephen Sondheim musical 'Sunday in the Park with George' was inspired by French artist Georges Seurat's painting 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.' The musical pays homage to the groundbreaking technique of Pointillism and dives into themes surrounding artistic inspiration, personal struggles, and the creative process. By examining the lives of two artists separated by a century, the musical offers a unique perspective on the lasting impact of Seurat's legacy in the art world and the challenges faced by artists across generations."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

About 45 minutes after she goes ape shit, I see the texts from my parents ( my dad had texted me a bunch too because my mom told him that I was avoiding her or something). I responded to my mom like this: my dad knows where I am, (she asked if dad knew where I was) Sam's parent's were ok with me staying the night, (they were) and that I had already told her throughout the week that I was staying the night at a friend's house Friday (3 times in fact). What's even worse, Sam tells me later that my mom had called his parents (who were asleep) multiple times around MIDNIGHT. On top of that, my mom texts me back that I need to start being more responsible and I was acting like a brat. Today she is still mad at me and now wants me to download an app that lets her track me 24/7. My dad brushed this whole thing aside because \\"being a single parent is hard\\". Don't get me wrong, I'm so grateful to have parents that care about me, but I don't think her behavior can be swept under the rug because \\"being a single parent is hard\\". AITA for still being mad at her? TL;DR : Went to sleepover at friend's house and notified my parents the days prior.

Context: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was one of the first people to study conservation?, using the article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation., what would be the answer ?

Now, let's match the concept with the answer choices provided: - Energy: While biomass relates to energy in terms of trophic levels and nutrient flow, biomass itself is not a measure or form of energy, so this answer is not correct. - Plants growth: Biomass can refer to the mass of plants at a trophic level, but it does not represent the growth process itself. - Food chain: This answer matches the original description given and is the correct answer. Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a step in the food chain. - Agriculture: Biomass is not exclusive to agriculture but is present in all ecosystems, including aquatic ecosystems, grasslands, and forests. - Animal survival: While biomass is consumed by animals for their survival, it does not specifically measure animal survival rates. - Energy. (repeated): Same explanation as the first \\"Energy\\" answer choice. - Energy usage: Biomass relates to the flow of energy through ecosystems, but does not specifically measure energy usage or efficiency. - Kinetic energy: Biomass is not a direct measure or type of kinetic energy.

Today, we're going to chat about taking some big leaps in our lives. Have you ever felt nervous about doing something new? Maybe trying a different food or going on a tall slide? That feeling is what we call risk. Risk means there's a little bit of danger, but not the scary kind, like monsters or dark caves. It's more like the exciting kind when you don't know if you can climb the big playground structure, but you want to try anyway! Understanding the risks is like knowing that you might not like the new food you try, or you might feel scared when you're at the top of the slide. But it's okay because trying new things is how we learn and grow. Sometimes, we could end up finding our new favorite food or having the most fun we've ever had on a slide! But wait, there's a secret to handling these risks. We need patience. Patience just means waiting and not rushing. Have you ever seen a little caterpillar waiting in its cocoon before it becomes a butterfly? It needs to wait until it's ready to fly. Just like that, sometimes we need to wait until we have some time alone to think about the risk we want to take. It's nice to sit quietly sometimes, and think about the big things we want to do and how we're going to do them. Now, onto our next big leap: asking her out simply. Now, I don't mean asking a girl out for a date, after all, you're just five! This is more about asking a friend if they want to play or share your toys. It's normal to feel a little nervous because we're scared they might say no. But remember, it's okay. We simply walk up to our friend, with a big smile on our face, and politely ask them if they want to join us. Remember to use kind words, that always helps. One last thing to remember is to exercise restraint. That's a big word, isn't it? Restraint means to control our actions and not to rush things. It's like when you're coloring a picture: it's always best to color carefully inside the lines instead of rushing and getting messy. The same thing goes with talking to our friends. We don't want to overwhelm them by asking too many things at once or talking too much without letting them speak. Remember kiddos, taking risks can be a great adventure, if we understand what we're doing, wait until the right time, ask simply and politely, and always show self-control.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it. Question: Is Benedykt popular among his employees? Options: - Yes, they like him because he can play golf - No, they hate him - not enough information - Yes, they love him because he's a good leader === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"No, they hate him. The detailed answer is as follows: Benedykt Ossolinsky is not popular among his employees, as they find him to be an infantile spoiled brat. His midlife crisis and newfound childish behavior only further reinforced their view of him as an unfit leader. Additionally, Benedykt does not seem to enjoy his job, which involves fulfilling the requirements of a highly honorable and prestigious position as the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family. Benedykt's dissatisfaction with his job and his feelings that it is stressful and forces him to make super-human sacrifices are further indicators that he may not be a good leader within the organization. His choice to wear a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" to the office is a clear sign of protest against his family and the job, which his employees would likely see as immature and unprofessional. The employees' dislike for Benedykt is not directly related to his ability to play golf or attend social functions, as these are simply requirements of his job. Rather, it is his overall behavior and attitude that they find distasteful, making him an unpopular boss among his employees."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Which entity is this text about? The Wallflowers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989 by singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In 2001, Jakob Dylan began writing for the Wallflowers' fourth album, Red Letter Days. Later that year while on tour with John Mellencamp, the band began recording using portable equipment. Some recording was also done at keyboardist Rami Jaffee's house. Once the band was finished touring for the year they began recording the bulk of the new record at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa Monica. By the time the Wallflowers had gotten into Browne's studio, Michael Ward had left the band, leaving them without a lead guitarist for the recording process. Dylan took on much of the lead guitar duties with Mike McCready, Rusty Anderson and Val McCallum also contributing on guitar. Moe Z M.D., who had been touring with Mellencamp, contributed additional percussion and background vocals to the album.Red Letter Days was produced by founding Wallflowers member Tobi Miller along with Bill Appleberry. Recording continued through the new year and was completed on April 12, 2002. The album was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, who had mixed the band's previous two albums. Mixing was completed on May 15, 2002. While the Wallflowers were working on Red Letter Days, they recorded a cover of the Beatles' 1965 song \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" for the soundtrack to the 2001 film I Am Sam. The soundtrack was released on January 8, 2002. The first single from the Red Letter Days, \\"When You're On Top,\\" was released to radio on August 16, 2002. A music video directed by Marc Webb followed. After a few false starts, Red Letter Days was released on November 5, 2002. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews. Many critics noted the harder rock sound and catchy melodies used throughout the album. Commercial performance was relatively mixed as well, peaking at No.32 on the Billboard 200. Around the time of Red Letter Days' release the Wallflowers embarked on a monthlong U.S. tour stretching into early December. After another U.S. tour in January 2003, the Wallflowers toured in several European countries in February including Spain, Italy, Germany and Great Britain. After this tour, the Wallflowers' drummer since 1995, Mario Calire announced he was parting ways with the band. In 2003, the Wallflowers were featured on the soundtrack for the film American Wedding. The band recorded a cover of Van Morrison's 1970 song \\"Into the Mystic\\". The film's music department weren't able to secure the licensing rights to use Morrison's version so they enlisted the Wallflowers to cover the song. Both versions of the song were, however, featured in the film.","completion":"This text is about The Wallflowers, an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989.

A British drone blew up Islamic State fanatics as they tried to plant roadside bombs, it was announced yesterday. It is the first strike by a British Reaper drone against IS in Iraq. The heavily-armed Reaper appears to have killed a group of jihadists involved in a battle near Iraq’s largest oil refinery north of Baghdad. A number of the remotely piloted aircraft – armed with Hellfire missiles – have been deployed to spy on the brutal IS terrorists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria. They had been conducting surveillance for the past couple of weeks but at the weekend one of them struck. It follows the announcement that Britain was stepping up its military presence in Iraq by committing more troops to train","completion":"local forces in their fight against the extremist group. Defence sources confirmed that the decision was made in response to the continuing threat posed by IS, also known as ISIS or Daesh, and due to the necessity of supporting the Iraqi security forces in their efforts to reclaim territory and maintain stability in the region. As part of this plan, the UK has increased its deployment of military advisers and trainers to the region, who will work closely with their Iraqi and Kurdish counterparts to help enhance their skills and capabilities. These troops will provide valuable assistance in areas such as tactical planning, intelligence gathering, and the use of advanced technology and weaponry. In addition to the military training, the British forces will also focus on humanitarian efforts to help thousands of displaced people and refugees affected by the conflict. This includes providing medical support, food, and shelter, as well as helping to rebuild infrastructure damaged by the fighting. The involvement of the British Reaper drone in this operation highlights the importance of utilising cutting-edge technology in modern warfare. The drones not only provide invaluable surveillance information about enemy movements and resource locations but can also act as a powerful deterrent against potential attacks, as demonstrated in the recent strike. The successful operation is a stark indicator of the capabilities of such advanced technology in targeting and neutralising threats while minimising the risk to coalition forces and innocent civilians. Furthermore, the UK's commitment to the region is just one part of a broader international effort against IS, comprising a coalition of over 70 countries including the United States, France, and Germany. This collective approach aims to share resources and expertise, thus maximising the impact of each nation's contributions and increasing the chances of defeating the extremist group swiftly and effectively. As the fight against IS continues, it is crucial that the international community remains resolute in its efforts to combat this violent and dangerous organisation. By working together and deploying a comprehensive strategy that includes military, political, and humanitarian measures, the coalition can effectively undermine the group's capabilities, limiting its reach and ultimately bringing about its eventual defeat. The use of advanced technology, such as the British Reaper drones, plays a key role in achieving this objective, demonstrating the adaptability and resilience of modern warfare in the face of ever-evolving threats."},{"prompt":"Generate a question that has the following answer: Southern California. for the following movie plot: The film traces the story of a family's struggle for survival in the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975 to North Vietnam's communist regime.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise.

A dilemma for a children's party, perhaps. But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents.

The question is the last sentence in the input. The story has one of the three following scenarios: (1) when the individual's belief matches reality, (2) when the individual's belief does not match reality, (3) is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. The question will ask about the location of an object in the story with respect to either none or one of the three scenarios. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Jayden entered the den. Avery entered the den. The tangerine is in the red_envelope. Avery exited the den. Jayden moved the tangerine to the red_drawer. Jayden exited the den. Avery entered the den. Where does Jayden think that Avery searches for the tangerine? Student:","completion":"First, let's analyze the story step by step: 1. Jayden entered the den. 2. Avery entered the den. 3. The tangerine is in the red_envelope. 4. Avery exited the den. 5. Jayden moved the tangerine to the red_drawer. 6. Jayden exited the den. 7. Avery entered the den. Now, let's determine the scenario from the three given options: 1. Individual's belief matches reality. 2. Individual's belief does not match reality. 3. An individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs. Based on the story, we are in scenario 3: Jayden has a false belief about Avery's beliefs. At the time Avery exited the den, the tangerine was in the red_envelope. However, after Avery left, Jayden moved the tangerine to the red_drawer. Avery did not see this action, so she would still believe it to be in the red_envelope. Jayden, on the other hand, should be aware of this change. So the answer to the question, \\"Where does Jayden think that Avery searches for the tangerine?\\" is the red_envelope. Jayden thinks Avery will search for the tangerine where it was originally, in the red_envelope, since she is unaware that Jayden moved it to the red_drawer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The longest time span of bird pairings can be several years or until the death of one mate. This occurs among socially monogamous bird species, which make up ninety-five percent of all bird species. These pairings last for at least the length of the breeding season, and in some cases, can extend for several years or persist until one mate dies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hertha Berlin have reacted to their slump to the bottom of the German Bundesliga by announcing that coach Lucien Favre has been relieved of his duties. Lucien Favre has paid the ultimate price for Hertha Berlin's dismal start to the Bundesliga season. Hertha's 5-1 defeat to Hoffenheim, a result which left them rooted to the foot of the table, was their sixth consecutive league reverse. The club were also knocked out of the German Cup by second division 1860 Munich last week and were held to a 1-1 draw by Lithuanian side Ventspils in their opening Europa League group fixture 10 days ago. Favre's assistant Harald Gamperle has also been relieved of his duties with youth-team coach Karsten Heine appointed on an interim basis. \\"Coach Lucien Favre and Harald Gamperle have been relieved of their duties effective immediately,\\" said a statement on the club's official Web site. \\"The training of the team will be controlled on an interim basis by Under-23 coach Karsten Heine.\\" Favre took charge just over two years ago and, after consolidating their position in the top flight in his first year, he then led them to an unexpected fourth-placed finish last term. Hertha were even still in the race for the Bundesliga title with two games of the season remaining. However, the loss of key players Andrei Voronin, Marko Pantelic and Josip Simunic this summer and the failure to find adequate replacements has contributed to a terrible start to the season which has cost the Swiss his job. Hertha's only league win this year came on the opening day of the season, when they defeated Hannover 1-0. Since then they have been beaten by Borussia Monchengladbach, Bochum, Werder Bremen, Mainz, Freiburg and Hoffenheim. Crowd figures have also slumped from an average of over 50,000 last season to under 40,000 for their last home game against Freiburg as fans became disillusioned with their side's dramatic slump. Explaining the decision, general manager Michael Preetz told a news conference: \\"We are caught in this downward spiral, we have tried to get out of it but unfortunately it has not been possible. \\"After the last two large defeats in the Bundesliga we find ourselves in a situation where it has become necessary for Lucien Favre and Harald Gamperle to leave. The board is fully behind my decision.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Hertha Berlin has dismissed coach Lucien Favre and his assistant Harald Gamperle following the team's poor performance in the German Bundesliga. The team's recent 5-1 loss to Hoffenheim marked their sixth consecutive league defeat, placing them at the bottom of the table. Additionally, Hertha Berlin was eliminated from the German Cup by second division team 1860 Munich and drew 1-1 with Lithuanian side Ventspils in their first Europa League group fixture. Under-23 coach Karsten Heine has been appointed as the interim head coach. Favre's tenure saw an impressive fourth-place finish in the last season, but the loss of key players and failure to secure adequate replacements contributed to the team's poor performance this year. Hertha Berlin's only league win in the current season was against Hannover on the opening day, followed by defeats against Borussia Monchengladbach, Bochum, Werder Bremen, Mainz, Freiburg, and Hoffenheim. The team's deteriorating condition also led to a decrease in crowd figures, which went from an average of over 50,000 last season to under 40,000 for their last home game against Freiburg.

Christopher found it easy to shake off the taunts of their haters but Nelson couldn't.","completion":"Nelson, unlike his brother Christopher, was a soft-hearted soul. While Christopher walked through life with his head held high, unperturbed by the sharp barbs thrown his way, Nelson found it impossible to let the words wash over him like water off a duck's back. He internalized each snide remark, every harsh insult, as if they were blades that sliced through his spirit, leaving him wounded, raw and vulnerable. Nelson would often sit quietly after such encounters, his expressive eyes reflecting his inner turmoil. For him, the world wasn't just a labyrinth of mute objects and silent landscapes. More significantly, it was a symphony of emotions and narratives, heartbeats and sighs. He heard what many didn't, saw what many were blind to. And so, every evil laugh, every dismissive wave, every scornful look - they all resonated with him, absorbed into the porous surface of his sensitive soul. Christopher, on the other hand, was made of sterner stuff. He embraced the world with the optimism of a fool and the courage of a warrior. He was resistant to the negativity that surrounded him, could shrug off the taunts, converting them into fuel that only spurred him forward. His mind, unlike Nelson's, was not a repository of others' darkness but a wellspring of his light. Christopher and Nelson, despite being so different, loved and respected each other. To Christopher, Nelson was an enigma - a sensitive poet with an otherworldly outlook. To Nelson, Christopher was an anchor - a rigid oak that stood firm despite the harshest winds. They balanced each other out. Seeing his brother's struggle with the cruel world, Christopher decided to help. He admitted that he couldn’t entirely grasp the depths of Nelson's torment - the torment caused by mere words, whispers in the wind. However, he wanted to understand. Naturally resilient and optimistic, Christopher sought to impart the same armor to Nelson. He suggested Nelson channel his feelings through a creative outlet, such as painting, writing, or even making music. After some resistance, Nelson decided to give it a try, discovering, in the process, a talent for songwriting. The hurtful barbs and taunts were transformed into poignant lyrics, giving voice to other sensitive souls like his. Meanwhile, Christopher also spearheaded a campaign against bullying in their school, leveraging his charismatic personality. He sought to build an environment of respect and mutual understanding, to show that strength wasn't about how many punches one could take, but about how many times one could bounce back and keep moving forward. As time passed, Nelson found himself more equipped to face negativity. His songs became his catharsis, a balm to his soul, and a rallying cry for others who shared his struggles. As for Christopher, he saw his brother grow stronger every day, his own protective shield stretching out to shelter others as well. In the end, the differences between Christopher and Nelson, rather than pulling them apart, only served to bring them closer together. The two of them, who were worlds apart in their handling of adversities, found a middle ground where they could stand together against the haters. They showed the world that sensitivity was not a weakness and resilience was not insensitivity. Through their experiences, they demonstrated that it was these very differences that contributed to the beautiful diversity and richness of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: If exercise increases flexibility and muscle tone, then what helps increase flexibility and muscle tone? Step 1: Identify the key terms in the question. - \\"exercise\\" - \\"flexibility\\" - \\"muscle tone\\" Step 2: Review each answer choice and evaluate if it matches the key terms. - movement: Movement implies various activities and motions that directly or indirectly involve physical exercise, which can lead to increased flexibility and muscle tone. - hydration: While hydration is essential for overall well-being, it cannot independently increase flexibility and muscle tone. - fitness membership: A fitness membership provides access to exercise facilities and various workout options, which can contribute to increased flexibility and muscle tone. - fats: Fats are essential nutrients, but they don't directly contribute to increased flexibility and muscle tone. - hypertrophy: Hypertrophy describes the increase in muscle mass, which can be a result of exercise; this term is related to muscle tone but not flexibility. - arteries: Arteries are blood vessels that transport blood from the heart; they have no direct impact on flexibility and muscle tone. - exercise: Exercise is directly mentioned in the question, and the key term we were asked about, and it is responsible for increasing flexibility and muscle tone. - Proteins: Proteins play an essential role in building and repairing muscle tissue, but they don't directly increase flexibility or muscle tone without involving exercise.

Question: Who is saved when Chris shoots Ricky with a shotgun? Movie title: Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out! Movie plot: After being shot down by police at the end of the previous film, the infamous Santa Claus Killer Richard \\"Ricky\\" Caldwell has been left comatose for six years, with a transparent dome being affixed to his head by the doctors in order to repair his damaged skull. Wanting to contact Ricky, the eccentric Dr. Newbury begins using a blind clairvoyant girl named Laura Anderson to try reach out to him. One Christmas Eve, after a particularly traumatic session with Newbury, Laura begins to regret her participation in his experiment, but Newbury tries to convince her to keep trying, saying that they can talk more after Laura returns home from visiting her grandmother over the holiday. After Laura is picked up from the hospital by her older brother Chris, a drunk hospital employee dressed as Santa Claus wanders into Ricky's room and begins taunting him, rousing Ricky back to consciousness. Killing the Santa impersonator Ricky escapes from the hospital, taking a letter opener with him after killing a receptionist as well. Picked up from a session with her psychiatrist, Laura is introduced by her brother to his new girlfriend, a flight attendant named Jerri who Laura takes a dislike to. As the trio head off to Granny's they fail to notice Ricky (who can hear Laura thanks to the mental link formed between them) following them. Acquiring a truck and some fuel after murdering a motorist and a gas station attendant, Ricky makes it to Granny's first; believing Ricky is simply an unfortunate handicapped vagrant Granny tries befriending him, but is killed when Ricky is provoked at the sight of a Christmas gift she offers him. At the hospital the two staff members butchered by Ricky are found by Lieutenant Connely and Newbury who begin trying to track Ricky down, realizing he is drawn towards Laura after surveillance camera footage shows him uttering her name.

To provide some context, after Ricky escapes from the hospital and kills several people along the way, he follows Laura and her family to her grandmother's house due to the mental link formed between them during Dr. Newbury's experiments. Unbeknownst to Laura, Chris, and Jerri, Ricky arrives at the grandmother's house first and kills her. When Laura, Chris, and Jerri arrive at the house, Laura feels that something is off but her concerns are initially dismissed by her brother, Chris. However, it doesn't take long for them to realize that Ricky is indeed at the house and poses a great danger to them. Throughout the movie, there is a cat-and-mouse game between Ricky and the protagonists as they try to evade the homicidal Santa Claus Killer and survive the night. As the tension in the film builds, Lieutenant Connely and Dr. Newbury manage to track Ricky down in an attempt to stop his killing spree. A confrontation ensues, and Ricky's mental connection with Laura ultimately becomes his downfall. In a climactic moment, Chris takes action to protect his sister and shoots Ricky with a shotgun, saving Laura from the killer.

(T), joining the ranks of U.S. TV, Internet and wireless providers racing to consolidate, is in advanced talks to acquire DirecTV (DIG1) for about 50 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Under the plan being discussed, management of DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T, said the people, asking not to be named because the information is private. DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White is likely to retire after 2015, the people said. The purchase would give AT&T a national satellite-TV provider to combine with its wireless, phone and high-speed broadband Internet services as competition ramps up. The pool of pay-TV customers is peaking in the U.S. because viewers are increasingly watching video online, and the combination would keep DirecTV from being on its own with just a TV offering and no competitive Internet package. “With DirecTV they are getting a national TV presence -- they can sell TV with wireless nationwide,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, based in Dedham, Massachusetts. “AT&T has increasingly been breaking out of their 22-state landline footprint. They sell wireless, they started selling home security and they could add TV to that package.” Photographer: Patrick T.

A price could come in close to 95 a share, depending on how much cash or stock is in the transaction, another person said. The person said White’s future after a merger is also still being negotiated. The price could go as high as 100 a share, two other people said. Cash-Stock The deal could be reached in the next couple of weeks while the sides negotiate the cash-stock component along with the size of the termination fee, said another person familiar with the matter. The termination fee is important because that payment would go to DirecTV from AT&T if the deal was blocked for various reasons, including by regulators on antitrust grounds. In AT&T’s failed effort to acquire Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile US unit in 2011, the company paid out 3 billion in cash plus wireless frequencies and a roaming agreement. AT&T fell 1 percent to 36.20 at the close in New York. DirecTV slipped 1.2 percent to 86.08, after gaining 26 percent this year through yesterday. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is one of the biggest beneficiaries of DirecTV’s rally, thanks to a stake built by his deputy stock pickers at about half the current price. Berkshire had about 36.5 million shares as of Dec. 31, a filing shows.

Latin America AT&T would be getting a pay-TV business that’s expanding in Latin America and generating higher monthly bills from U.S. customers. DirecTV’s exclusive content includes the National Football League Sunday Ticket package and products such as Genie, a multiroom digital video recorder. Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA) plan to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) Inc. -- to create an even bigger provider of both TV and Internet in the U.S. -- is accelerating the drive for consolidation in the rest of the industry. In March, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson called the Time Warner Cable takeover an “industry-redefining deal.” The question with all of these potential tie-ups is whether regulators will allow them. Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable hasn’t been approved yet. A merger of DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. (DISH) was blocked more than a decade ago, and AT&T had to abandon a purchase of T-Mobile several years ago in the face of antitrust opposition. Regulatory Approval DirecTV and AT&T are planning on a 12-month regulatory process to review the deal, one of the people said. “If regulators let Comcast buy Time Warner Cable, there’s no reason they wouldn’t let AT&T buy DirecTV,” Entner said. “They have to see it as part of a holistic market.” Getting ownership of DirecTV’s Latin American units would cause a conflict for AT&T, which holds an 8 percent stake in America Movil SAB (AMXL) -- a direct competitor to DirecTV in countries including Brazil and Colombia. DirecTV’s Latin America operation includes Mexico, where it has a minority stake in Sky Mexico, controlled by Grupo Televisa SAB, one of America Movil’s biggest rivals. DirecTV had also drawn merger interest from Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen, people with knowledge of the matter said in March. While a DirecTV merger is tempting, the satellite-TV rival is too expensive to pursue, Ergen said last week on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings. Debt Funding “If DTV is willing to sell for 100 then it must be either concerned about its lack of broadband long term, worried about the viability of a Dish merger, or both,” Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a research note. Darris Gringeri, a DirecTV spokesman, declined to comment as did Brad Burns, an AT&T spokesman. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that AT&T is planning a stock and cash bid for DirecTV (DTV), without specifying the price. AT&T can afford to add about 16 billion in debt to fund the DirecTV deal without risking a credit-rating downgrade, according to Erich Marriott, an analyst with Bloomberg Industries. The company is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- at Standard & Poor’s, both four levels above junk. Adding 16 billion of debt would keep AT&T’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization below 2.5, the level at which credit ratings agencies have said may trigger a downgrade, Marriott wrote in a research note. The analysis assumes deal synergies of about 10 percent. That implies that AT&T will need to offer a significant portion of stock to fund the 50 billion acquisition. The company has about 3.6 billion of cash and near-cash items and two revolving credit agreements with a combined 8 billion available, according to a regulatory filing. “We were thinking AT&T would want to use as much debt as they can and that the deal could be all cash,” said John Hodulik, an analyst with UBS AG. “But that would mean the leverage would be about 2.7, and that’s too high. I think they’d prefer 2.5 leverage.” To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Sherman in New York at asherman6@bloomberg.net; Jeffrey McCracken in New York at jmccracken3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Mohammed Hadi at mhadi1@bloomberg.net; Sarah Rabil at srabil@bloomberg.net Sarah Rabil ||||| Photo AT&T is in talks to buy DirecTV for at least 50 billion, and the two sides are actively working toward an announcement, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. If completed, a deal would give AT&T, the country’s second-largest wireless carrier, control of the country’s largest satellite television provider, further reshaping the rapidly changing telecommunications and television industries. AT&T has grown interested in DirecTV in recent months, according to several people with knowledge of the company’s thinking, leading to an approach in the last few weeks. Rumors of a deal between the two companies have sent DirecTV shares up about 12 percent this month. On Monday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that talks had accelerated, details on the timing and the price of a deal began coming into focus. The terms of any agreement are not expected to be released in the next two weeks, and the two sides are working on a pricing structure under which AT&T would pay 92 to 94 a share. In addition, Mike White, DirecTV’s chief executive, is not expected to step down if the deal goes through. DirecTV closed at 87.16 on Monday, but was up sharply in after-hours trading. For AT&T, a deal for DirecTV would signal its continued ambitions to grow in the United States, after its attempted takeover of the rival wireless carrier T-Mobile failed in 2011 because of resistance from regulators. This year, AT&T was looking to expand in Europe and considering an acquisition of Vodafone, which sold its stake in Verizon Wireless back to Verizon Communications for 130 billion in February. But AT&T has refocused its attention on the United States market, believing it has an opportunity to expand its footprint in the pay-television business. DirecTV has about 20 million subscribers in the United States. Talks between AT&T and DirecTV began in earnest after Comcast announced its plan to acquire Time Warner Cable. That deal, if completed, would create a clear leader in the cable television industry. Photo People knowledgeable about both deals said that if AT&T and DirecTV announced a merger, it could complicate the review of Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable, because antitrust regulators might want to consider both deals simultaneously. By acquiring DirecTV, AT&T could bolster its small television operations and gain a valuable foothold in Latin America, where DirecTV has about 18 million subscribers. But several people in the industry said they believed that the ideal target for AT&T would be not DirecTV but its main competitor, Dish Network. Dish, run by the billionaire Charles W. Ergen, has amassed a trove of spectrum that could be valuable to AT&T as it seeks to build out its wireless network. Some investment bankers privately speculated that talks between AT&T and DirecTV were intended to draw Mr. Ergen off the sidelines and into the fray. But last week, speaking in a conference call after announcing first-quarter earnings, Mr. Ergen said his company was not in a position to make an offer for DirecTV. “DirecTV would be too frothy for us, for our board to look at, at those kinds of prices,” he said. Photo AT&T is facing renewed competition in the wireless market. Verizon has taken full control of Verizon Wireless, giving it access to additional cash. And Sprint, the third-largest wireless provider, has struck a deal with Japan’s SoftBank that will give it added firepower as it seeks to expand. Another deal on the horizon could be Sprint’s making an offer for T-Mobile, the fourth-largest wireless carrier, which is just completing its own major purchase. Last year, T-Mobile acquired MetroPCS. People briefed on the discussions between AT&T and DirecTV said there was no guarantee that a deal would be completed. AT&T and DirecTV declined to comment. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting. ||||| NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES AT&T; Inc is in active talks to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV and may complete a deal in the next few weeks that could be worth close to 50 billion, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The second-largest wireless operator is discussing an offer in the low- to mid-90s per share for DirecTV, one of the people said, compared with the company's closing price of 87.16 on Monday. A bid near 95 per share would value DirecTV at more than 48 billion based on its shares outstanding, and would represent a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT&T;'s interest first emerged on May 1. The deal price has yet to be finalized and terms could still change, the people said, adding that discussions are continuing. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said. The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms, cable and satellite TV space, which is being roiled by Comcast Corp's proposed 45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc as well as market forces such as the rise of Web-based TV and surging mobile Internet usage. AT&T; and DirecTV declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT&T; was offering to pay around 100 per share for DirecTV, whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T.; (link.reuters.com/xyf39v). The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks. DirecTV shares rose 6 percent to 92.50 in extended trading on Monday. DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs Group to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT&T;, Reuters reported last week. A combination of AT&T; and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable. For that reason, the proposed merger is likely to face a prolonged battle to convince regulators to allow further consolidation in pay-TV. \\"This is not the first time that AT&T; and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go,\\" said ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner. \\"They both looked at each other for at least 10 years. Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment. It makes a lot of sense to get together, but there was never the right regulatory environment for it.\\" A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT&T-DirecTV;, Entner said. He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV. \\"They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon. DirecTV hasn't gone out and bought spectrum. Dish has, so DirecTV needs to find a partner, and AT&T; is that partner,\\" he said. Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie-up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp. But Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen last week said his company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie-up would create many benefits.

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, or EULEX, is a civilian mission implemented and coordinated by the European Union. Its main goal is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in establishing and maintaining the rule of law, especially in the areas of the police, judiciary, and customs. The Commission's role is crucial in ensuring that the mission has the right resources, such as personnel and equipment, to carry out its mandate effectively and efficiently.

By providing expertise, mentoring, and direct intervention when necessary, the mission has helped the Kosovo police, judiciary, and customs authorities to enhance their capacities, professionalism, and adherence to international standards. However, challenges still remain in many areas, such as combating corruption and organized crime, ensuring the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, and protecting the rights of minorities and vulnerable groups. The provision of adequate personnel and equipment by the Commission is essential for the success of EULEX, as it enables the mission to undertake a wide range of activities. These include training and capacity-building initiatives for local authorities, monitoring and supervising the implementation of reforms and compliance with international standards and best practices, and conducting investigations and prosecutions in cases where the local institutions may lack the capacity or will to do so themselves. In this context, the timely delivery of the necessary personnel and equipment by the Commission has been crucial for EULEX to remain operational and effective. Although the mission is gradually transitioning to a more advisory role, it still requires substantial resources to support the ongoing efforts of the Kosovo authorities in building the rule of law and ensuring the stability and growth of the country. In conclusion, the Commission's ability to provide EULEX with the necessary personnel and equipment on time has been vital for the mission's success in promoting and strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo.

Todd McFarlane was born on March 16, 1961 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Bob and Sherlee McFarlane. He has two brothers, Curtis and Derek. Bob worked in the printing business, which led him to take work where he could find it, and as a result, during McFarlane's childhood, the family lived in thirty different places from Alberta to California. McFarlane began drawing as a hobby at an early age, and developed an interest in comics, acquiring as many as he could, and learning to draw from them. McFarlane lost judgments in two lawsuits in the 2000s. The first was a 2002 suit which McFarlane contested with writer Neil Gaiman over the rights to some supporting Spawn characters created by Gaiman in issue No. 9 of the Spawn series and over payment for later works featuring those characters. In 1997 the two signed a deal in which Gaiman would give his share of characters Angela, Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro to McFarlane in exchange for McFarlane's share of British superhero Marvelman (in reality, what McFarlane actually owned were two trademarks for Miracleman logos, not the character, which would become clear only after the lawsuit concluded). This deal was broken by McFarlane, which motivated Gaiman to start the lawsuit. The jury was unanimous in favor of Gaiman. The two were involved in a lengthy dispute over ownership of Miracleman, but no lawsuit has been filed in that dispute. In 2009, Marvel Comics resolved the matter by purchasing the property. The second was a December 2004 suit in which hockey player Tony Twist sued McFarlane because he named a mobster character in Spawn after Twist. The lawsuit was settled out of court for 5 million. As of late 2012, McFarlane was suing a former employee whose name is the same as the alter ego of Spawn, Al Simmons. According to a lawsuit lodged in Arizona federal court, the real Al Simmons published a book called The Art of Being Spawn, in which Simmons purportedly suggests that his own life was the inspiration for the Spawn character. McFarlane's position was that Simmons violated the terms of his employment pact and breached his duty of loyalty.

First and foremost, the context mentions that the railway station is located on the Zürich–Winterthur railway line, an important route that connects the two major Swiss cities of Zürich and Winterthur. The station's strategic location allows it to connect passengers traveling along this railway line to different transportation systems, thereby acting as a crucial interchange point. Furthermore, the station is served by S-Bahn line S7, which adds to our hypothesis. As a part of the wider Zürich S-Bahn network, S7 enhances the connectivity between various destinations across the canton of Zürich. By offering access to the S-Bahn network, Kloten Balsberg station plays an essential role in navigating travelers to their desired locations. Moreover, Kloten Balsberg station is also served by Zürich tram routes 10 and 12, which operate on behalf of the Stadtbahn Glattal light rail system. Light rail systems like Stadtbahn Glattal provide an efficient mode of public transportation within urban areas, promoting easy access to various neighborhoods and points of interest in the region. Consequently, the station's integration with the Stadtbahn Glattal system further solidifies its intermediary position among diverse transportation systems. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Kloten Balsberg station acts as an important intermediary between different transportation systems in and around the canton of Zürich. Not only does it enable passengers to access and transfer between the Zürich S-Bahn and the Stadtbahn Glattal light rail system, but it also contributes to a well-connected and efficient public transportation network throughout the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dog bite A:","completion":"Title: Crescent Moon's Hound Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: The small, isolated town of Crescent Moon Valley has been known for its tranquil atmosphere and welcoming community. The only downside seems to be the overpopulation of stray dogs that roam its streets. However, that once trivial issue takes a darker turn when a string of unexplained deaths begins to terrorize the town's peaceful existence. Detective Alex Rivers is assigned to the case when the body of the first victim, Thomas Gilbert, is discovered in the woods. The autopsy reveals that Gilbert was killed by a dog bite on his neck, but the bite appears to be unusually precise and deliberate. The case quickly attracts the attention of local journalist Sarah Landon, who joins Detective Rivers to investigate. As they delve into the town's secrets, more victims turn up with the same mysterious dog bite on their bodies. Together, Rivers and Landon discover that the victims all share a connection to an old legend about a curse placed upon the town by a woman named Miranda Blackwood, who was wronged by the people of Crescent Moon Valley and sentenced to hang for witchcraft back in the 1800s. According to legend, before her execution, Miranda vowed that her loyal hound would continue to seek vengeance on the descendants of those involved in her death. Now, it seems that her prophetic words are coming to life as her hound rises again, taking the lives of the guilty descendants. Rivers and Landon narrow down the list of potential targets and race to protect the remaining vulnerable members of the town. Along the way, they encounter Victor, the eccentric caretaker of the Blackwood estate, who has answered Miranda's call to bring forth her hound. As the body count continues to rise, a lead brings Rivers and Landon to an old crypt beneath Miranda's family estate where they find Victor conducting a sinister ritual with the hound. With time running out, they confront Victor and disarm him, only to learn that the hound is not a regular dog, but a supernatural entity summoned by Miranda. In the thrilling climax, Rivers and Landon use their wits and knowledge of the curse to banish the hound back to where it came from, saving the remaining targets. Victor faces justice for his part in the murders, and the town of Crescent Moon Valley can finally begin to heal, working to make amends for their dark, inherited past. With the case closed, Sarah Landon publishes her story, bringing awareness to the town's history and the curse of the Blackwood hound. Detective Rivers returns to his precinct, forever changed by the experience and wary of the supernatural forces that may still lurk in the shadows."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Movie title: The Lady Vanishes Movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

I read this background article the other day: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). I am facing a new situation today: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which runner didn't have an increased heart rate? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Jim did not have an increased heart rate before starting to run, as he skipped his warm-up due to being late. Warm-ups help gradually increase the heart rate and blood flow to the muscles, making them better prepared for physical activity and reducing the risk of injuries. Tom, on the other hand, made sure to warm up properly before running, so his heart rate would have increased as a part of the warm-up process. Therefore, Jim is the runner who did not have an increased heart rate prior to exercising. It is important to note that this does not mean Jim's heart rate did not increase at all during the run, but rather it was not increased before starting the activity due to a lack of proper warm-up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can buy applique templates from a craft store if you don't want to design your own. You can also find patterns in quilting books. If you use a quilt pattern, make sure you resize it when copying so that it fits your greeting card. To make a paper appliqué card, you will need the following: One 4.25 by 5.5 inches (10.8 cm × 14.0 cm) card blank Colored cardstock Decorative paper A fine-tip black marker Glue Scissors A ruler A pencil and eraser What kind of card are you making? If you're making a birthday card, you might consider making a card with a cake, or party hats. Try to customize the card to reflect the interests of who you are giving it to. Make a space scene with astronauts and planets, or make a card with cars and a racetrack. Make a card with snowmen for Christmas, turkeys for Thanksgiving, or clovers for St. Patrick's Day. Your only limit is your imagination. Pick three different patterns for your card. You'll need a pattern for the appliqué pieces, a pattern for the background, and a pattern for the card mat. Select a variety of solid colors and patterns. Depending on the complexity of your design, you may want to choose more than three types of decorative paper. Whatever you decide to go with, make sure all the colors and patterns match. For example, if you're making an underwater scene, pick a variety of blues for your solid colors. Choose patterns that mimic waves or fish scales. If you're following a template, trace the shapes on the back of the your decorative paper. If you're drawing your own shapes, draw them lightly in pencil on the back of the decorative paper. Once you're happy with the designs, cut out the shapes. Since you're working with paper, you won't actually be sewing anything. To give it an authentic appliqué look, take your fine-tip marker and add stitch marks around the border of the shapes. Choose a solid color for your card mat and cut it a little smaller than your card blank. It should almost cover the entire front of the card, but you should still see a little white border. To make the background, take a patterned piece of decorative paper and cut it to about 5 by 3.75 inches (12.7 cm × 9.5 cm). Using your fine-tip marker, add stitch marks to the background pattern. Glue the mat to the card. Remember to leave a small border of white from the card blank. Then, glue the background to the card mat. Once the card mat and the background are glued to the card blank, start arranging your shapes to build a scene. Take some time to make sure you have everything arranged where you want it. If you find that you need to add more shapes to flesh out your scene, grab more decorative paper and start cutting. Don't forget to add the stitch marks! Once everything is to your liking, glue your shapes down.

Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured leaving his house this morning, is assessing the damage to the Lib Dems' local government base. Nick. Clegg today refused to resign as Lib Dem leader after losing control of some of his party's flagship councils. The Lib Dems were ousted from Portsmouth after a surge of support for Ukip while the Tories took control of Kingston-upon-Thames - the local authority of Energy Secretary Ed Davey. A rare glimmer of good news came in Eastleigh, where the Lib Dems have tightened their grip on the local authority after successfully defending the parliamentary seat in a by-election last year. Mr Clegg conceded that his party had suffered at the hands of a Ukip surge, blaming a 'very strong anti-politics feeling among the public. But he added: 'Actually I think in the areas where we have MPs where we have good organisation on the ground... we are actually doing well.' The Lib Dems are are on course to lose around 300 seats. Earlier Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone said her party had lost its ‘humanity’ in office. ‘Ukip. have managed to sound like human beings – that’s Nigel Farage’s big. win,’ she told the BBC. ‘All of us have become so guarded, we are so. on-message that we seem to have lost some of our humanity. ‘The. Lib Dems are the whipping boys in the coalition. In the last general. election debates Nick came across as the human being… Partly being in. government, we have become more ministerial, we have become more. political. We have lost some of the humanity Nick had four years ago.’ With. rumours swirling of a leadership plot, Mr Clegg has urged his party not. to ‘lose its nerve’ just as the Government’s key decisions are being. ‘vindicated’. Mr Clegg told reporters it was 'never easy' seeing 'dedicated, hard-working' councillors kicked out. But he said he would 'absolutely not' resign, and insisted the Lib Dems were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition. 'Based on the results which have come in so far, it has obviously been a mixed result, a mixed night for my party, for the Liberal Democrats and the other mainstream parties,' Mr Clegg said. 'We will see what the further results today, what story they tell. But so far what I have seen is that where we can work really hard to tell our side of the story, we can win.' He added: 'I certainly accept that there is a very strong anti-politics mood around, not only in our country but in many other parts of Europe as well. I think you will see that in European elections in the days to come... 'There is a very strong mood of restlessness and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics and that is reflected in the results for all mainstream parties, including the Lib Dems.' Mr Clegg is under fresh pressure, with the Lib Dems braced to lose many of their MEPs when the European election results emerge on Sunday night. WINS: Did well in Eastleigh - stopping Ukip from taking any seats on council. LOSSES: Portsmouth slipped into no overall control, as Ukip took four seats. Tories took overall control of Kingston-upon-Thames. Labour took Cambridge. Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Malcolm Bruce played down his party's losses and stressed it intended to be a 'major force' in British politics for the foreseeable future. He told BBC Breakfast: 'It is obviously disappointing to lose councillors, particularly those who have worked hard in their community and may have been replaced by those who haven't got a track record. 'But actually we are pleased that where we have targeted our resources, particularly in held seats or key seats, we have actually had very good results. 'That's really very important for us. Getting an even share across the country doesn't deliver seats, getting them in the seats that matter is what matters to us.' Senior party. figures dismiss ideas that Mr Clegg could be replaced by Danny Alexander or. Vince Cable, but are preparing for a bumpy few weeks if the results are. bad. In several European election polls, the party has been languishing. in fifth place behind the Greens. A. poll suggests that only 46 per cent of Lib Dem voters would want Mr. Clegg to stay in his job if the party ends up in that position. David. Cameron and senior Tories, however, are said to be planning a ‘Save. Clegg’ operation that will see the Lib Dems given ‘wins’ in the. forthcoming Queen’s Speech. Lib. Dem sources insisted their vote was holding up well in their. Parliamentary seats, and that both the Tories and Labour were falling. short of the sort of results they need to demonstrate if they want to. win a majority next year. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article center around the Lib Dem party's performance in local government elections, its implications, and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's response to these outcomes. Here are the key details: 1. The Liberal Democrats' (Lib Dems) significant loss in the local government elections: The party lost control of key councils including Portsmouth, to a surge of support for the UK Independence Party (Ukip), and Kingston-upon-Thames, which went to the Conservatives (Tories). The party is projected to lose approximately 300 seats. 2. Clegg's reaction to these losses: Clegg acknowledged that the party was facing a setback, attributing it to a strong anti-establishment sentiment among the public. However, he denied that he would resign as the party leader, citing that in areas where the party has strong organization and MPs, they were doing well. 3. A rare win in Eastleigh: In the midst of significant losses, the party had a positive outcome in Eastleigh where they tightened their grip on local authority after successfully defending the parliamentary seat in a by-election the previous year. 4. An internal critique of the party: Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone criticized the party for losing its 'humanity' since gaining office. She insinuated party communications were too guarded, and the public perceived the party's role as 'the whipping boys' in the coalition government, losing the humanity element that made them appealing. 5. Speculations on Clegg's position: Amid rumoured challenges to his leadership, Clegg urged his party not to 'lose their nerve'. The speculation is that senior party figures are dismissing the idea of replacing Clegg despite the party's recent downfall. In fact, it is noted that Prime Minister David Cameron and senior Tories are planning a ‘Save Clegg’ operation. 6. Results of European elections: The article mentions that the party is expected to lose many of their MEPs when the European election results are announced, which will add more pressure on Clegg. 7. Deputy Lib Dem leader's perspective: Despite the setbacks, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Malcolm Bruce downplayed the losses and mentioned that where the party had targeted resources, they had good results. 8. Future prospects: The article suggests that the party's performance in the upcoming Queen’s Speech, as well as in their Parliamentary seats, could counterbalance the recent losses and be pivotal for the future trajectory of the party and Clegg's position as the leader."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: If you decide veganism isn't for you, you're not alone. There are plenty of others out there just like you who, for whatever reason, decided the vegan way was not for them. Using your favorite internet search engine, search for a phrase like “leaving veganism” or “I quit being vegan.” Reading accounts and thinking about the experiences of others who have felt like veganism was too much for them might help you reach a positive decision for yourself. If you find you empathize with their perspectives, perhaps you're ready to quit being vegan, too. Ask yourself why you began eating a vegan diet in the first place and if you still hold the same beliefs. Have your beliefs changed around factory farming or the consumption of meat and animal products? If so, veganism may no longer resonate with your values, and you might wish to resume eating the standard omnivorous diet. Perhaps you became a vegan because you are against factory farming. You may choose to eat only animal products that are confirmed free-range and humanely slaughtered. In this case, you may be able to marry your beliefs about the humane treatment of animals with eating meat. The lack of satisfaction might take many forms. Perhaps you salivate at the sight or smell of bacon. Perhaps you have cravings for meat or even vegetarian foods. Or maybe you feel bad when you're out with friends and the only thing on the menu that's vegan is fries and a salad. If you were raised vegan and have never tried meat, dairy, fish, or eggs, you might wonder what you're missing. Try branching out with some non-vegan foods to see if an omnivorous diet might be for you. Just because you aren't happy with the food you're eating doesn't necessarily require that you give up veganism. Maybe you just haven't found the kind of vegan foods you like yet. Suggest a vegan restaurant to your friends next time you go out. Don't feel ashamed or bad for making your friends accommodate you — they're your friends and will be happy to do so! Plus, they'll get the opportunity to branch out and try something new. If you feel veganism isn't right for you because you do not have acceptable alternatives, look around a bit more. Vegan versions of almost every food imaginable are available somewhere. Try shopping at a different grocery store than the one you usually patronize. Small grocers and health food stores are worth checking out. Perhaps you come from a culture or society which values killing and eating animals. These animals might be located and killed by you directly in hunting, or simply purchased from the local butcher by way of factory farms. If you feel you are unable to fully share in certain family rituals (a big annual barbecue cookout, for instance), you may be considering giving up veganism. Before giving up veganism, think about ways that you might adapt to, and still partake in, rituals with your friends or family. Suggest that instead of hunting and killing the animals in the forest, you venture into the forest to enjoy the solitude of nature and grace of the animals you track together. You'd then get to share quality time and conversation with your father, mother, brothers, or whomever, while staying vegan. Don't let others pressure you to give up veganism (or become vegan) if you aren't ready or don't want to. Doing something you don't really want to do in order to please others is a recipe for frustration and unhappiness. Is there some professional reason you might be obligated or strongly encouraged to eat animal products? Food journalists, for instance, will need to try a variety of dishes when reviewing restaurants or food products, including foods which they themselves won't eat. (Rarely is a restaurant's signature dish vegan.) Workers in the food service industry — cooks, bakers, and waiters — may be expected to sample non-vegan foods so as to better prepare or describe them. Consider putting a vegan spin on your profession. If you are a food journalist, maybe you can start specializing in vegan cuisine and restaurants. If you are in the restaurant industry, you may be able to find a vegan restaurant where you can work. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses various reasons people might feel that veganism isn't right for them and suggests ways to address these concerns or consider alternative diets. Factors such as personal beliefs, cravings, social influences, cultural customs, and professional obligations can contribute to doubts about maintaining a vegan lifestyle. People questioning their commitment to veganism should reflect on their reasons for choosing the diet, explore alternative options (such as humane animal products), try new vegan foods and establishments, and consider adapting cultural and professional practices to align with their values. Ultimately, the decision to continue or abandon veganism should be based on one's personal beliefs and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \\"activity\\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics , strength building, and flexibility exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day. On days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day. Just as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes. Here are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change: The author advises dividing activity into shorter exercise breaks because _ .

The full extent of George Osborne’s stealth tax raid on pensioners was laid bare yesterday. Around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest – losing £323 annually with the end of age-related income allowances. In all, the ‘granny tax’ will take £3.5billion from the pockets of more than 4.4million pensioners. Senior Tories have denounced it privately as the Chancellor’s biggest blunder. Burden: Around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest - losing £323 annually with the end of age-related income allowances. The new rules are so arbitrary that some OAPs will lose far more than others born a day before them. Ros Altmann of Saga said: ‘Middle-class pensioners are outraged. My inbox is full of angry emails from those who did save for their future but are now hit. ‘The message of this Budget is, don’t bother to save for the future and if you’re too old to work any more you don’t count.’ The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor should have given advance notice of his plan to freeze the £10,500 tax-free allowance for the over-65s. Lord Tebbit described it as an assault on pensioners who have put money aside. ‘The freezing and gradual abolition of the age-related tax allowance is an error,’ said the Tory grandee. ‘It hurts those who have saved enough for modest pensions. It is unfair and lousy politics.’ Part of the justification for the move was the promise of a more generous state pension of around £140 a week. But this is not expected to be introduced until 2016 – and even then only for those who hit pension age at the time. That means that those who retired between these dates would lose both a higher allowance and the better pension – a double attack on their incomes. This will affect around 2.8million pensioners – 700,000 a year for four years. Existing pensioners are likely to be forced to see out their days living on the current state pension which, from April, will pay £107.45 a week. Senior Tories have denounced the so-called Granny Tax privately as the Chancellor's biggest blunder. The IFS found that all pensioners with incomes of between £10,800 and £26,200 turning 65 next year would lose out on £323 as a result of the Budget. They will be part of the 4.4million to be punished, with average losses of £83. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘The most unfair part of George Osborne’s tax raid on pensioners is the effect on people turning 65 next year. ‘How can it be right that someone born a day too late loses over £300 with little advance warning? Just as on his botched changes to child benefit, the Chancellor has simply not thought through the effect of his policies on ordinary people.' The poorest pensioners are not affected since they do not pay income tax and the richest pensioners do not get the allowance in any case. In Wednesday’s Budget statement, the Chancellor said no one would be out of pocket as a result of his changes since the tax allowance for the over-65s would be frozen rather than cut. He boasted that it was an attempt to simplify the tax system. But Paul Johnson of the IFS said Mr Osborne ‘should have avoided dressing up what is clearly a tax increase as merely a simplification’. He suggested that, for the change to be presented as a reform rather than a tax hike, it should have been delayed until personal allowances reach £10,000 – expected to happen in 2014 or 2015. But in a rare boost for the Chancellor, the IFS said there was a justification for making cuts on pensioners because they had done better than younger people from the Government’s austerity measures. Mr Johnson said: ‘Our analysis shows that they have lost considerably less from recent tax and benefit changes than any other demographic group. And over the past decade and more pensioner incomes have risen faster than those of the working age population. ‘This looks like a relatively modest tax increase on a group hitherto well sheltered from tax and benefit changes.’ David Cameron dismissed claims that pensioners were going to be hit, calling it a ‘fair Budget for all our people’. Speaking to reporters in Bradford, the Prime Minister pointed to the future increases in the state pension. ‘The first thing is that every granny around the country is going to be benefiting from the biggest ever increase in the pension that comes in in April – an extra £5.30 a week. ‘And at the same time, the Budget also delivered a tax cut for 24million people in our country, and also we’ve now taken 2million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether. It’s a good Budget for our economy and it’s a fair Budget for all our people.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘This is an important simplification. It’s sensible to have a single tax-free personal allowance for everyone. ‘The poorest half of pensioners will still pay no tax in 2013/14 and nobody will pay more tax in cash terms than they do today. ‘Compared to the plans the Government inherited, an existing pensioner with a full basic state pension will gain more from the triple lock in each of the next three years than they will lose from the age-related allowances freeze.’ Mr Cable said the major feature of yesterday’s Budget was the large increase in the personal tax allowance to £9,205 from April 2013. He said: ‘We are giving people the freedom to choose how to spend their own money, not taking it from them and then giving it back in a complex, means-tested system of tax credits.’ And defending the changes to pensioners’ tax allowances, Mr Cable said the Budget was transferring £1.7billion to pensioners –against £360million taken away by the allowances changes. He said pensioners on lower incomes would benefit from the growing personal tax allowances under the simplified system, while increases in the basic state pension would give cash in real terms. The Business Secretary said: ‘There is a small group of people, frankly my contemporaries, who have high retirement income and considerable asset wealth and it is right in principle they should pay a bit more. There is a group of people who are not wealthy, on not particularly high income, and who could be affected to a limited extent as a result of inflation eroding the value of the allowances. Those people will benefit enormously from the increase in the basic pension.’ Mr Cable accused Labour of failing to fix the state pension system, ensuring the value of the pension fell back further and further from incomes. Mr Osborne stuck to a previous promise to increase the allowance to £10,500 for those aged 65, and £10,660 for the oldest pensioners. This meant the over-65s appeared to be gaining an extra tax break. But what he didn’t make clear was that by freezing allowances after this, any pensioner who already pays tax will get only 80p for every £1 increase in their pension. This is because the amount they can earn tax free will not change and, as a result, every extra pound in income above the allowance is taxed at the basic rate of 20 per cent.

When dietary fats are consumed, they either provide energy for the body's activities or are stored for future use. If the body already has enough energy from other sources such as carbohydrates, these dietary fats will not be used immediately for energy production. Instead, they will be stored in the body's adipose tissue, commonly referred to as body fat. Adipose tissue comprises fat cells, which are specialized cells designed to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides. This energy can be accessed and mobilized when the body needs it, such as during times of fasting, intense physical activity, or caloric deficiency. The process of breaking down stored fat and releasing it into the bloodstream to be utilized for energy is known as lipolysis. It's important to note that the body needs a certain amount of fat for proper function. Fats play a crucial role in many processes, including protection and insulation of vital organs, temperature regulation, hormone production, and aiding in the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. However, consuming an excessive amount of dietary fats can lead to weight gain and may increase the risk of developing various health issues, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it's essential to have a balanced diet and consume fats in moderation, focusing on healthy fats (such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) rather than unhealthy ones (trans and saturated fats). In summary, when fats are not immediately used for energy by the body, they are typically stored in the adipose tissue for future use. This storage process helps the body maintain sufficient energy reserves for various physiological functions and ensures energy availability during periods of high demand or scarcity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Police have arrested a man in the killing of Auburn University freshman Lauren Burk, who died this week, according to the Auburn, Alabama, assistant police chief. Courtney Larrell Lockhart, 23, of Smiths, Alabama, is charged with capital murder during a kidnapping, capital murder during a robbery, and capital murder during an attempted rape, Tommy Dawson said Saturday. The Phenix City Police Department took Lockhart into custody on Friday, police said. Phenix City is about 35 miles southeast of Auburn. Burk, 18, from Marietta, Georgia, was found shot on North College Street, a few miles north of campus, on Tuesday night. She died later at a hospital. Minutes after police responded to the call reporting an injured person and found Burk, they found a car -- which turned out to be Burk's -- on fire in a campus parking lot. Dawson told reporters Friday that authorities think gasoline or another accelerant was used to ignite Burk's car, and police were investigating whether a gas can found in downtown Auburn was connected. Police want to investigate every possible lead, Dawson said. Authorities were still on patrol in the east Alabama campus, he said. The university's Web site said a campus-wide memorial service will be held Monday. The site carried a message from Burk's father, James, which said: \\"The Burk family was so proud to have Lauren as an Auburn University student. We want to extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation for Auburn University, the city of Auburn and the Auburn Police Department. We feel very close to your community. We appreciate what everyone is doing for us and Lauren.\\" Also on Friday, police released pictures of a 2001 Honda Civic similar to Burk's car. Authorities asked anyone who thinks they might have seen the car on Tuesday to contact them. Police are continuing to interview people, Dawson said. A student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill -- Eve Carson, 22, of Athens, Georgia -- was also shot to death this week, on early Wednesday. Authorities in Chapel Hill said Friday they had been in contact with Auburn police but did not believe the two cases were connected.

The Stockholm-based Swedish Academy announced last Thursday that Jelinek won this year's Nobel Prize in literature. She is recognized for her socially critical novels and plays.

However, it is not sufficient to fully answer the question, \\"How did the 1990 release of 78 rpm effect Rhino Records?\\" So the answer to the selection question would be 2). no. To provide a detailed response to the original question, let us first understand the context. Rhino Records, an American specialty record label, was founded in 1978 and is known for its diverse catalog that includes compilation albums, reissues, and remastered versions of classic recordings. In the early years, the company's primary focus was on niche markets, particularly enthusiast collectors of obscure rock and roll, doo-wop, blues, and jazz music. In the 1990s, Rhino Records saw an opportunity to cater to the owners of vintage jukeboxes and collectors who had an interest in preserving the early days of rock and roll. They came up with the idea of issuing a series of boxed sets containing 78 rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits. This move connected with the nostalgic aspects of the golden age of jukeboxes, as 78 rpm records were the primary format used in jukeboxes from the 1930s to the late 1950s. The 1990 release of 78 rpm reissues had several impacts on Rhino Records: 1. Recognition and Brand Growth: The release of these boxed sets established Rhino Records as a reputable and reliable source for collectors of rare and valuable 78 rpm records. This contributed to the company's brand growth and expansion into additional niche markets. 2. Expertise Development: Rhino Records focused on carefully selecting, restoring, and remastering the original material for these reissues. This process allowed the company to develop expertise in handling and preserving old recordings, likely leading to future preservation projects and collaborations. 3. Revenue and Profitability: The 78 rpm reissues served a niche market of collectors and enthusiasts, who were willing to pay a premium for high-quality versions of their favorite early rock and roll hits. This generated revenue for Rhino Records, and potentially increased profitability due to the exclusivity and demand for such products. 4. Building Relationships with Artists and Copyright Holders: Rhino Records had to obtain licenses and permissions from artists and copyright holders in order to reissue these 78 rpm records. Through this process, the company likely developed strong relationships with industry professionals, which could have led to other partnership opportunities and collaborations in the future. Overall, the 1990 release of 78 rpm reissues by Rhino Records not only helped establish the company as a reputable source for collectors, but also contributed to their brand growth, revenue, and expertise in handling historical recordings, while building relationships within the music industry."},{"prompt":"Article: In 1638, John Harvard donated some money and about four hundred books to a new university.

It might imply that the film has a laid-back storytelling approach, allowing the audience to unwind and let their minds wander in a similar manner to how one savors a lazy summer afternoon. The movie could also offer a nostalgic or comforting atmosphere, reminiscent of carefree times spent under the sun during the summertime. One may also perceive the critic's remark as implying that the movie has a slow pace, which some viewers might appreciate since it is a departure from the fast-paced, action-packed films often found in cinemas. This could be seen as a refreshing change, inviting the audience to pause, reflect, and to appreciate the unfolding of the story at a leisurely pace. However, the phrase could also be interpreted negatively, depending on the preferences of the reader or the intended message of the critic. A \\"lazy summer afternoon\\" might be viewed as slow, uneventful, or even boring. In this interpretation, the critic is stating that the movie possesses a lack of excitement or significant plot development. They may feel that although the film has a pastoral and picturesque quality, it failed to fully engage or captivate the viewer due to its lack of intensity or captivating moments. Moreover, the term \\"lazy\\" could imply that the movie's execution, from the script to the acting, felt lethargic and uninspired. In other words, the critic may be remarking that the movie lacked ambition and failed to challenge or provoke deep thoughts among the viewers, ultimately making it an unmemorable experience. In conclusion, the phrase \\"like a lazy summer afternoon\\" can be perceived in both positive or negative light, although it generally leans more towards a positive impression.

Although some of the other choices, such as damage or death, could potentially result from this aggressive behavior, \\"harm\\" is the most direct and general consequence of jumping, biting, and growling that aligns with the teacher's definition of aggression. Aggressive behavior in animals can stem from various factors, including fear, territorial defense, mating competition, or other situational factors. The intention behind the aggressive action is to protect themselves, their offspring, or to establish dominance in a particular situation.

Plot title: Conan the Barbarian Movie plot: Opening narration Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis and the rise of the sons of Aryus, there was an age undreamed-of. And unto this Conan, destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga. Let me tell you of the days of high adventure. Wizard of the Mounds[2] Conan the Barbarian is a film about a young barbarian's quest to avenge his parents' deaths. The story is set in the fictional Hyborian Age, thousands of years before the rise of modern civilization.[3] The film opens with the words, \\"That which does not kill us makes us stronger\\", a paraphrasing of Friedrich Nietzsche,[nb 1] on a black screen followed by a voice-over that establishes the film as the story of Conan's origin.[2][5] \\"A burst of drums and trumpets\\" accompanies the forging of a sword,[3][nb 2] after which the scene shifts to a mountain top, where the swordsmith tells his young son Conan about the Riddle of Steel, an aphorism on the importance of the metal to their people,[7][8] the Cimmerians.[9] The Cimmerians are massacred by a band of warriors led by Thulsa Doom. Conan's father is killed by dogs, and his sword is taken by Doom to decapitate Conan's mother. The children are taken into slavery; Conan is chained to a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. Years of pushing the huge grindstone build up his muscles. His master trains him to be a gladiator, and after winning many pit fights, Conan is freed. As he wanders the world, he encounters a witch and befriends Subotai, a thief and archer.[10][11] Following the witch's advice, Conan and Subotai go to Shadizar, in the land of Zamora, to seek out Doom.[12] They meet Valeria, a female brigand, who becomes Conan's lover.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What has a range of sexual reproductive systems? \\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"roundworms make up the phylum Nematoda\\" and \\"within the Nematoda, a range of reproductive systems occur\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What has a range of sexual reproductive systems?\\" is the phylum Nematoda, specifically referring to roundworms. Among the diverse group of roundworms, a variety of reproductive systems can be found. Roundworms exhibit a range of sexual reproductive systems, including separate sexes (dioecious), hermaphroditism, and parthenogenesis. In the case of dioecious roundworms, individuals are either male or female. Males usually have specialized copulatory structures such as spicules, which are utilized to transfer sperm to females during mating. Females, in turn, produce eggs that are fertilized by the male sperm. Hermaphroditism is another reproductive system observed among roundworms, where an individual possesses both male and female reproductive organs. In this case, a single roundworm can generate sperm and eggs, allowing it to mate with itself or with another individual. This increases the chances of successful reproduction, even in the absence of other individuals of the same species. Parthenogenesis is yet another reproductive system in some roundworms, a process by which offspring are produced through unfertilized eggs. This asexual reproduction can be found in certain nematodes, allowing them to reproduce without the need for mating. In conclusion, the phylum Nematoda, with its roundworm members, exhibits a range of sexual reproductive systems, making it the best answer to the question. This diversity of reproductive strategies allows roundworms to adapt and thrive in a wide array of environments, and contributes to their success as one of the most abundant and diverse groups of animals on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cheryl Ann Tweedy was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983, and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan, and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was eleven years old. At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas. In 2014, Cheryl returned as a judge on the UK version of The X Factor for its eleventh series, signing a PS1.5 million contract. She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, and she chose Chloe Jasmine, Stephanie Nala, Lauren Platt and Lola Saunders for the live shows. Nala and Jasmine were eliminated in week 2 and Saunders in week 4, while Platt finished fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to The X Factor for its twelfth series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw. She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and chose 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered and Reggie 'n' Bollie for the live shows. Alien Uncovered were eliminated in week 1, while 4th Impact and Reggie 'n' Bollie finished in fifth and second place, respectively. Cheryl confirmed her departure from The X Factor in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career. On 2 June 2014, she debuted the first single from her fourth studio album Only Human, \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\", which features Tinie Tempah. Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium. On 27 July, \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became her fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora. The song also peaked at number one in Ireland. The second single from Only Human, \\"I Don't Care\\", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming her fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK. Only Human was released on 10 November and became her fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was later certified silver in the UK. The album's title track was chosen as its third single. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming her lowest-charting single to date. In 2015, Cheryl announced she was working on her fifth studio album, initially due for release in 2016.

Kimberley Ann \\"Kim\\" Deal (born June 10, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter and musician, best known as the former bassist and backing vocalist of the alternative rock band Pixies, and the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for The Breeders. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986 as the band's bassist, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and The Pixies' hiatus, she formed The Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs and later introduced her identical twin sister Kelley Deal. The Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to The Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993. Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect. For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions. This led to increased stress between the band members. Murphy commented that during the sessions, it \\"went from just all fun to work\\". Exhaustion, from releasing three records in two years and constant touring, contributed to the friction, particularly between Francis and Deal. The tension and exhaustion culminated at the end of the US \\"Fuck or Fight\\" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. The band soon announced a hiatus.

The World Trade Organization has ruled in favor of Mexico to the tune of 163 million in a longtime dispute over the fish. As NPR explains, the dispute centers on \\"dolphin-safe\\" labels on cans of tuna adopted by the US in 1990. The US claims that Mexico’s use of large-net fishing boats that chase and target dolphin schools to find tuna do not meet the country’s no-kill standards. But Mexico says the US rules unfairly target the country and do not take into account new practices that have drastically decreased dolphin deaths. Mexico claims losses as high as 472.3 million annually over the labels and filed the case back in 2008, reports Reuters. The US believes the number is closer to 21.9 million at most, but the WTO estimated it at 163 million, and said Mexico could impose retaliatory restrictions on the US to claw back that amount. The Office of the US Trade Representative says the decision doesn't take into account a new rule enacted in 2016 that expanded the restrictions to all countries, adding that it \\"dramatically overstates\\" the financial impact on Mexico. The WTO will next consider the 2016 changes made by the US, and its ruling in July could overturn this week's decision. Meanwhile, the Trump administration said Wednesday that it will attempt to renegotiate NAFTA, making the timing of this decision and trade relations with Mexico all the more sensitive. Expand this summary.","completion":"The latest point of contention between the United States and Mexico lies in the unexpected realm of the fishing industry, specifically concerning the unassuming yet remarkably contentious canned tuna. The World Trade Organization (WTO), the global overseeing body for international trade, has ruled decisively in favor of Mexico in this ongoing feud by awarding the country 163 million regarding this longstanding tuna dispute. Why tuna, one might ask? The center of the discord actually involves a critical aspect of environmental conservation, embodied in the form of \\"dolphin-safe\\" labels prominently featured on cans of tuna available in US markets since 1990. The US claims that fishing practices, employed particularly by Mexico, to catch tuna pose a significant hazard to dolphin populations. Mexico, on the other hand, takes exception to this characterization, marking it as a blatant case of unwarranted targeting. The disputes revolve around the method known as large-net fishing. This involves the use of expansively thrown fishing nets designed to cover a larger area. As dolphins and tuna often swim together, Mexican fishing boats, according to the US, specifically target dolphin schools to catch tuna. However, the US argues that this kind of fishing technique does not align with their strict no-kill standards designed to conserve dolphin populations. Mexico, for its part, argues strenuously against these allegations. The country maintains that US rules disproportionately and unjustly target Mexico, creating an uneven playing field. Moreover, Mexico emphasizes that over the years, it has introduced a range of new fishing practices that have conspicuously reduced dolphin deaths. This longstanding dispute has significant financial ramifications as well. Mexico alleges that due to the negative connotations of not carrying a \\"dolphin-safe\\" label, they have suffered significant sales losses in the US, a major export market. They have, in fact, quantified these losses as high as 472.3 million every year. The issue was first legally challenged by Mexico in 2008, as reported by Reuters, when they launched a case at the WTO. Interestingly, the version of events presented by the US provides a wildly different estimate. According to the US, the maximum amount Mexico might be losing is closer to 21.9 million. The WTO, after its evaluation, derived that the amount would be closer to 163 million rather than the larger sum projected by Mexico. Furthermore, the WTO has suggested that Mexico could place retaliatory trade restrictions against the US to retrieve this amount. However, the US Trade Representative's Office has voiced concerns regarding the WTO's ruling. They argue that the decision does not take into consideration a revised regulation enacted in 2016. This expanded rule saw the fishing restrictions associated with dolphin conservation extended to all countries that ship canned tuna to the US, not just Mexico. The office claims that this essentially 'levels the playing field', and accuses the WTO of grossly overstating the financial impact on Mexico. Looking ahead, in July, the WTO will evaluate the 2016 rule change from the US. Depending on the WTO's perspective on this change, there's a possibility that the current ruling in favor of Mexico might be overturned. Further complicating the scenario, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday, concurrent with the WTO’s ruling, that it intends to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement governs the majority of the trade activities between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The resolution of this dispute and the future trade relations between the US and Mexico are made increasingly sensitive by this announcement, bringing about potential unforeseen consequences rooted in a single can of tuna."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body - Question: suppose weather conditions cause less mushrooms happens, how will it affect air is converted into oxygen in the lung. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To understand how weather conditions causing less mushrooms can affect air being converted into oxygen in the lungs, we must first discuss how mushrooms relate to the oxygen levels in the atmosphere and the process of respiration. Although mushrooms are fungi and do not perform photosynthesis like plants, they do play a role in the decomposition process and contribute to the ecosystem's overall oxygen levels. Mushrooms are part of a larger group of organisms known as decomposers. These organisms play an essential role in breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. As decomposers, mushrooms release carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct during the process of decomposing dead plant material. This contributes to the overall levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. The presence of CO2 in the atmosphere is important because it plays a direct role in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the biochemical process in which plants and other photosynthetic organisms, such as algae and some bacteria, use sunlight and CO2 to produce oxygen and glucose. Therefore, the process of decomposition, facilitated in part by mushrooms, indirectly contributes to the total amount of oxygen available in the ecosystem, which ultimately has an impact on the overall respiratory process. If weather conditions lead to a decrease in the number of mushrooms in an ecosystem, there could be a decrease in the rate of decomposition and, consequently, a reduction in the amount of CO2 released back into the atmosphere. This could potentially result in a decrease in the photosynthesis process, thereby reducing overall oxygen production. Considering all these factors, the lower mushroom population could lead to a decrease in the available oxygen in the ecosystem. As a result, this could potentially affect the efficiency of the pulmonary system, including the process that converts air into oxygen in the lungs. With less oxygen available in the atmosphere, the lungs would need to work harder to extract and deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to the body's cells. In this scenario, therefore, the answer would be B: less - less oxygen would be available and the lungs would work less efficiently in converting air into oxygen due to the reduction in mushrooms and, as a consequence, the reduction in overall oxygen production in the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea.

The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\".

Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. The answer is:","completion":"The Momu tribe was less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. This ozone depletion leads to higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, which negatively impacts various aspects of life, including humans, nitrogen cycle, plankton, and ocean food webs. Since the Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica where the ozone hole is present, they are more likely to be affected by the consequences of ozone depletion and the subsequent disruption of ocean food webs. On the other hand, the Momu tribe resides in Northern Alaska near the North Pole, which is a considerable distance away from the ozone hole over Antarctica. While ozone depletion is a global concern, the specific situation described in the paragraph affects the Antarctic region more severely than other areas. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the Momu tribe is comparatively less affected by the disruption of ocean food webs than the Ana tribe due to their geographical location.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself.

Write an article based on this summary: Nigel Farage has said he would have \\"no choice\\" but to return to politics if Brexit was under threat, as UKIP look unlikely to win any seats.","completion":"Title: Nigel Farage Prepared to Return to Politics if Brexit is Under Threat Introduction Prominent British political figure and former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), Nigel Farage, has declared that he would have \\"no choice\\" but to return to politics if Brexit were in jeopardy. This announcement comes as UKIP appears unlikely to secure any seats in the recent elections. Justifying the Return One of the primary reasons Nigel Farage feels compelled to consider re-entering politics is his deeply-rooted belief in the importance of Brexit. As a prominent advocate for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, Farage has been heavily invested in the Brexit process since its inception. He believes the successful implementation of Brexit is crucial for the future of the UK, and any compromise on it would necessitate his return to the political scene. UKIP's Struggles and Farage's Role UKIP has struggled to maintain its relevance in the current political climate, primarily as its raison d'être has seemingly diminished following the successful Brexit referendum in 2016. The party's failure to secure any seats raises questions about its future, and whether Farage's return to UKIP would bolster its prospects. Over the years, Farage's charismatic leadership has been credited with the rise of UKIP and its influence on British politics. It's not surprising, then, that the possibility of his return would be seen as a potential boost for the struggling party. However, it remains unclear whether Farage's return would be to UKIP or another political group. The Future of Brexit and Farage's Impact Brexit continues to be a contentious topic within the UK, and political alliances are still shifting in response to the ongoing negotiations. Although considerable progress has been made in the past few years, obstacles and challenges remain as the country navigates the complexities of its departure from the EU. If Farage re-enters politics, his impact on the Brexit process could be significant. He's known for his uncompromising approach and could potentially serve as a unifying figure for the pro-Brexit faction. Farage's return to the political stage could influence policy decisions, and shape the UK's future relationship with the European Union. On the other hand, his involvement may also fuel further polarization within an already divided society. Conclusion The prospect of Nigel Farage returning to politics demonstrates the ongoing volatility and uncertainty around Brexit. As UKIP struggles to secure its position and influence, the potential for Farage's comeback presents an interesting development for both the party and the broader political climate. Depending on his role and impact, Farage's return could herald a turning point in the Brexit process, either propelling it forward or exacerbating existing divisions. Regardless of the outcome, his dedication to the cause remains unwavering, and his potential reemergence should be closely watched by both supporters and opponents alike."},{"prompt":"Question: What type of details about heernt can be gathered from the following bio?

Question: Given the following context: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end... answer the following question: What college is the only project Austen Harrison ever did in Britain?

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the church next to the Old Supreme Court building, the latter of which was also designed by Greenway? ? One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning. Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the 46-metre (150 ft) spire used to \\"serve as a guide for mariners coming up...

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who wondered \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\"?\\" is \\"Vice President Dick Cheney\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the provided information, it was Vice President Dick Cheney who wondered, \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" upon learning about the first plane crash into the North Tower. He was watching television in his office when he witnessed the second aircraft strike the South Tower, which underscored the unprecedented nature of the events that unfolded on September 11, 2001. As the details within the paragraph reveal, communication and information flow during those initial moments appeared limited and fragmented. Numerous key personnel, such as the FAA Administrator, her deputy, and President George W. Bush, were initially uninformed about the hijacking of American 11 and only learned about the situation from television or other sources that reported on the crash. It is also crucial to note that President Bush's initial reaction to the event was that it resulted from pilot error. The perception of events on September 11 rapidly evolved as more details emerged, shifting from disparate and isolated incidents towards a coordinated terrorist attack, with the involvement of multiple hijacked planes, causing significant loss of life and destruction. The response at various levels of the government during September 11 highlights the importance of effective communication channels, as well as well-coordinated emergency protocols and planning. Consequently, lessons learned from September 11 led to widespread changes in domestic and international security policies and systems to prevent similar tragedies in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not. - Darlington is a large market town in County Durham, in North East England, and part of the Tees Valley. With a population of 106,000 in 2011, the town lies on the River Skerne, a tributary of the River Tees. The town owes much of its development to the influence of local Quaker families in the Victorian era, and is famous as the terminus of Stockton and Darlington Railway, the world's first passenger railway. The town is often colloquially referred to as 'Darlo'. - The Local Government Association (LGA) is an organisation which comprises local authorities in England and Wales. The LGA seeks to promote better local government; it maintains communication between officers in different local authorities to develop best practice.

Joe Jackson Gibbs (born November 25, 1940) is a former American football coach, current NASCAR Championship team owner, and former NHRA team owner. He was the 20th and 26th head coach in the history of the Washington Redskins (1981-1992, 2004-2007). Well known for his long hours and work ethic, Gibbs constructed what Steve Sabol has called, \\"The most diverse dynasty in NFL history\\", building championship teams with many players who have had mediocre to average careers while playing for other NFL teams. During his first stint in the National Football League, he coached the Redskins for 12 seasons and led them to eight playoff appearances, four NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowl titles. Although Gibbs helped craft a passing-oriented attack during his time in San Diego, his Redskins teams were known to incorporate a smash-mouth, rushing-oriented attack like the counter trey. By building a strong offensive line (known as \\"The Hogs\\") Gibbs was able to control the line of scrimmage, allowing workhorse running backs such as John Riggins, George Rogers, and Earnest Byner to power the ground game. Gibbs added a deep passing attack to this which complemented the ground game, utilizing agile receivers such as Art Monk, Gary Clark, and Ricky Sanders. Gibbs' offense was aided during his tenure by aggressive defensive units under the direction of defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon. Gibbs' system and offensive scheme were robust enough to be successful without a Hall-of-Fame-caliber quarterback at the helm. The Redskins' Super Bowl victories were won featuring Joe Theismann, Doug Williams, and Mark Rypien--capable players who were very successful along with their strong supporting cast. Gibbs is credited with inventing the single back, double or triple tight end set. He used it to neutralize Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, realizing that to successfully block him with a running back was impossible; an extra tight end and a tackle were required as well. The extra tight end provided additional protection for the quarterback. Gibbs was also credited for creating the Trips formation; stacking three wide receivers to one side. Gibbs incorporated the shifting and motions for which his offenses were known. The formations created mismatches and confusion for the opposing defenses that would then be exploited. He is also one of few coaches that utilized the H-back position prominently in his offense.

Does derivation mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"Yes, the word \\"derivation\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, even though it refers to different cultural origins. In both cases, the term is used to describe the source, origin, or root from which something is derived or obtained. In Sentence 1, the phrase \\"Italian derivation\\" refers to the fact that the shoes are inspired by or originating from Italy, and that the design, craftsmanship, or materials associated with Italian shoemaking have influenced the shoes' style and quality. Italy is well-known for its fine leather goods, including shoes, so the statement suggests that the person has a preference for high-quality footwear with a touch of Italian style. In Sentence 2, the phrase \\"Turkish derivation\\" is used to demonstrate that the music has its roots or origins in the traditions, styles, instruments, or compositions found in Turkish culture. Turkey has a rich history of diverse musical genres, including classical music, folk music, and various regional styles. By emphasizing this musical heritage, the sentence conveys the idea that the person appreciates and enjoys music with a Turkish influence. Although the context of each sentence is different, the core meaning of \\"derivation\\" remains the same, pointing to the source or origin of the item in question, be it shoes or music. The word allows the reader to understand the cultural or stylistic roots of these items and the person's preferences for those specific origins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These opponents are not only attacking our right to freely practice our religion, but also the values that have defined this nation since its inception – freedom of worship, acceptance of diversity, and the promotion of understanding and dialogue between people of different faiths and cultures.\\" Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf stressed the importance of engaging in constructive conversation and finding common ground. \\"We must resist the temptation to give in to the voices of division and intolerance, and instead focus on the shared values that bind us together as Americans: our commitment to liberty, equality, and justice for all.\\" As the debate over the proposed Islamic center continues to unfold, religious leaders, community members, and politicians from both sides of the aisle have weighed in. Some, such as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have voiced their strong support for the project, emphasizing the constitutional rights of religious groups to build houses of worship and the importance of interfaith dialogue in fostering understanding and tolerance. \\"Moving forward with the Islamic center is crucial to demonstrating that America's values and principles will not be compromised by the hateful rhetoric of a few extremists,\\" Bloomberg said in a statement. \\"We must show the world that we are a nation of diverse and accepting, that we can come together to address our common challenges and embrace different beliefs.\\" On the other hand, many critics argue that building an Islamic center near ground zero is insensitive to the memory of those who perished in the 9/11 attacks. They have expressed their concerns about the imam's affiliations and the potential for the mosque to become a breeding ground for radicalization. Some have proposed alternative locations for the center, citing that it would be a more suitable way to respect the families and victims of 9/11. As tensions rise and emotions continue to flare, the religious leader behind the project remains committed to his vision of unity and understanding. Desperate to avoid further division and radicalization, the imam proposed a multi-religious center at the site. This new concept would include spaces for people of all faiths to come together, promoting a shared sense of community and fostering greater dialogue between different cultures and religions. \\"This is our way of answering those who seek to spread hate and fear,\\" Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf explained. \\"By creating a space where people of different faiths can come together to learn, pray, and heal, we can show the world that love and understanding can overcome even the deepest divides.\\" Though the future of the Islamic center and multi-religious center is uncertain, it is clear that the outcome will have far-reaching implications for America's national security, religious freedom, and the nation's efforts to counter extremism both at home and abroad. The challenge now lies in finding a resolution that ensures a fair balance between the rights of religious groups, the sensitivities of families and victims of 9/11, and the promotion of understanding and tolerance across faiths and cultures. Only then can America truly stand as a beacon of hope and freedom, demonstrating its unwavering dedication to democratic values and diversity in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What was a revered institution in the caliphate?\\" is in \\"The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"From the passage provided, it can be seen that various institutions held significant importance in the Caliphate. However, the one that stands out as particularly revered based on this context is the Imperial Harem. The Imperial Harem was a crucial power within the Ottoman court. It was governed by the Valide Sultan (Queen Mother or Sultan's Mother), who, at times, would play a role in state politics. This influence was so significant that it led to a period known as the \\"Sultanate of Women,\\" where the women of the Harem essentially controlled the state. This influence was not arbitrary or based on whims, the Imperial Harem also seems to have a structured system of education. The palace school system was tough, designed to eradicate the unfit potential heirs and establish support among the ruling elite for a successor. Apart from the Imperial Harem, there were other important institutions within the Caliphate as well. For instance, the educational institutions - Madrasa for Muslims and Enderûn, a free boarding school for Christians. These institutions were integral to state function, providing education for future administrators of the state and allowing social mobility for poor families. However, when we consider which institution was \\"revered\\", the term carries an implication of respect combined with awe. This seems to best apply to the Imperial Harem given its distinctive, near-regal power, and influence over state control. Thus, the revered institution in the Caliphate, as per the information you've provided, appears to be the Imperial Harem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jamaal Charles returned from an ankle injury and scored three touchdowns to guide the Kansas City Chiefs to a thumping 41-14 win over the New England Patriots on Monday. The running back, who missed last week's win in Miami with a sprained ankle, rushed for 92 yards and a score and also caught two touchdown passes from quarterback Alex Smith. Smith finished with 248 passing yards and three touchdowns at Arrowhead Stadium, but his opposite number Tom Brady was picked off twice on a miserable night for the Patriots. 'Coach said he was going to look for me, and see how it feels during the game,' Charles said, 'and I guess I started feeling like myself. He didn't want to take me out.' 'Just wanted to play everybody,'","completion":"Patriots coach Bill Belichick said after the game, as he tried to explain the failed strategies that led to their crushing defeat. 'We thought we could adjust accordingly, but Charles was a difference-maker tonight. We need to focus on improving and addressing our weaknesses.' In the days following the game, the Patriots took Belichick's words to heart and honed their skills. Their defense put extra time into studying their opponents' offensive strategies and preparing for unpredictable plays. Meanwhile, Brady did not allow the two interceptions to pull him down; instead, he practiced even more diligently to refine his passing accuracy and communication with his receivers. As the season progressed, the Kansas City Chiefs continued to thrive with Charles, and Alex Smith kept performing at a high level. However, they were not invincible, and a few losses along the way reminded them of the importance of staying focused and not getting complacent. The New England Patriots, fueled by their 41-14 loss to the Chiefs, managed to turn their season around. Their defense started to click, and Brady's renewed determination led to a string of impressive victories. Soon enough, both teams found themselves in the playoffs. The Chiefs and Patriots eventually met again in the playoffs. This time, however, the outcome was different. Drawing from their past errors and employing their improved skills, the Patriots emerged victorious in a hard-fought game, avenging their earlier loss to the Chiefs. The Patriots, having learned their lesson, didn't let their triumph bloat their confidence, and stayed focused in their pursuit of the ultimate prize. In the end, the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of the New England Patriots, driven by their crushing defeat in the regular season, paid off.

The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed today that the Moroccan suspect in the foiled attack on a high-speed train was hit with terrorism charges overnight. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins has said El-Khazzani, 26, watched a jihadi video on his cellphone moments before the attack and that—although he claimed to be homeless—he used a first-class ticket. Molins said the suspect's explanations became increasingly incoherent until he stopped speaking altogether to investigators. Among the terrorism charges he faces are multiple counts of attempted murder, possession of weapons, and conspiracy. Meanwhile, an American hero is back on US soil. Sacramento State student Anthony Sadler, who helped subdue El-Khazzani, arrived in Sacramento around 7pm last night. While the Sacramento Bee reports that he didn't speak to media, KCRA notes Sadler hasn't entirely avoided the spotlight: He hit the red carpet in Paris on Monday for the Straight Outta Compton premiere. It's unclear when pals Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos will return home. (Part of why Sadler and his friends were in the right place at the right time: bad WiFi.) Expand this summary.","completion":"French prosecutors remain unconvinced by Ayoub El-Khazzani's argument that he was merely a hungry individual who discovered a bag of weapons in a park and intended to use these to rob for food money. The recent affirmation from the Paris prosecutor's office strongly suggests they believe there are more sinister undertones to El-Khazzani's narrative. The Moroccan, identified as a suspect in the thwarted attack on a high-speed train, has been formally charged with terrorism activities. El-Khazzani, aged 26, fell further into suspicion after Paris prosecutor Francois Molins claimed that the young man viewed a jihadist outrage video on his smartphone just before the planned attack. Moreover, El-Khazzani's claim of being homeless raised more questions when it was revealed he utilized a first-class train ticket. Molins highlighted that the suspect's justifications began to lose credibility over time, eventually leading to his complete refusal to communicate further with the officials leading his investigation. El-Khazzani stands accused of various serious offenses, all falling under the general terrorism umbrella. Among his charges are multiple instances of attempted murder, unlawful possession of weapons, and entering into a conspiracy. All these charges hint at a premeditated plan of large-scale destruction and chaos, rather than the desperate robbery for food money that El-Khazzani claimed. While France remains clouded by these grim proceedings, the United States welcomed back one of its heroes. Anthony Sadler, a student at Sacramento State college, was one of a group who played a crucial role in neutralizing El-Khazzani. Sadler returned home to Sacramento at approximately 7pm the previous evening.

When you encounter impatience from a boss or coworker it can actually negatively impact your performance. If you know that you are going to be dealing with someone who is impatient, try to prioritize the work so that you can alleviate distress on both accounts.","completion":"Another powerful technique is to improve communication and transparency by providing regular updates and progress reports, which can help in assuaging concerns and provide assurance to the impatient person that the work is being completed on schedule. At the same time, it's crucial to stay mindful of your own emotions and reactions when these encounters occur. Developing effective stress management and emotional regulation strategies can prove beneficial, as they equip you with the tools required to remain calm and focused under pressure. Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and setting personal boundaries can contribute to creating a healthier work environment and fostering better relationships with those who struggle with impatience. Furthermore, you should strive to understand the underlying causes of the individual's impatience, as this insight may enable you to tailor your responses and approach accordingly. It is important to recognize that impatience may often stem from personal stress, anxiety, or high expectations, and adopting a compassionate perspective can help ease tensions and facilitate smoother collaboration. When necessary, consider engaging in constructive and open dialogue to address any perceived time constraints or issues that may be contributing to the person's impatience. This can be an opportunity for both parties to exchange thoughts and establish a mutual understanding, which can ultimately lead to a more efficient workflow and increased job satisfaction. In addition, honing your time management and organizational skills can go a long way in handling impatient people effectively. By establishing a clear plan, setting achievable goals, and regularly evaluating your progress, you'll be better equipped to provide accurate time estimates and demonstrate a strong sense of accountability. This competency will not only boost your credibility in the eyes of the impatient person but also minimize the likelihood of unanticipated delays and setbacks. Remember that it is sometimes necessary to be assertive and diplomatically express your concerns regarding unrealistic expectations or deadlines. Standing up for yourself and providing context for why certain tasks may require more time to complete can help the impatient person understand the complexity of the situation. Make sure to maintain a positive and solutions-oriented mindset while articulating your perspective, as this attitude can have a calming effect on the situation. In summary, coping with impatient people at work involves anticipating their behavior, prioritizing tasks, enhancing communication, managing personal emotions and reactions, understanding the underlying causes of impatience, developing effective time management and organizational skills, and maintaining a collaborative and assertive attitude. By mastering these strategies, you can create an environment where everyone is empowered to perform their best, and relationships are built on understanding and respect."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: \\"Minwax\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

I'll say up front that the complicating factor here is that her parents told her about five weeks ago that they are getting divorced. After forty years! I can't even imagine the thought process going through her dad's head here. This coming summer, we have her friend's wedding in another state that's close to her state and far away from the state we live in together. That is something I committed to and I will go there. Now, however, she just told me that we need to go spend time in her state afterwards so she can see her friends, she wants me to be there for the first time she has to actually see her parents.

The movie follows Bodhidharma's journey as he discovers his life's purpose and strives to preserve his family's formidable lineage, all while facing the challenges and threats posed by a conspiracy within his own kingdom. Plot: In the Indian subcontinent during the 5th century AD, the Pallava Dynasty ruled with prosperity and peace, maintaining strong trade connections and flourishing arts and culture. King Selvaraj, the ruler of the empire, is a wise and respected leader, dedicated to preserving the tradition and legacy of the Pallavas. The story begins as a young Prince Bodhidharma (the protagonist) lives a life of luxury and privilege, receiving the finest education and mastering martial arts. However, he continually experiences recurring dreams and visions of an unfamiliar land and struggles to understand the meaning behind them. One day, the kingdom receives a message from a mysterious envoy from the east, who has come in search of someone they believe is the fulfillment of a long-prophesized spiritual leader. These envoys recognize that this chosen one is none other than Prince Bodhidharma. Intrigued and compelled to understand the meaning behind his vivid dreams, Bodhidharma follows the envoys back to their homeland, China. As Bodhidharma departs, a conspiracy unfolds within the kingdom, revealing a faction of court officials plotting to take over the Pallava Dynasty by exploiting the prince's absence. While on his journey to China, Bodhidharma undergoes rigorous physical and spiritual training, discovering his true purpose and destiny – teaching the Chinese people the secrets of meditation, medicine, and martial arts. Consequently, he becomes the founder of Shaolin Kung Fu and Zen Buddhism. Meanwhile, in the Pallava Empire, the malicious conspirators execute their plan to overthrow King Selvaraj. With the kingdom in danger, the queen sends a messenger to Bodhidharma, urging him to return and save the empire. Bodhidharma, torn between continuing his spiritual journey or protecting his family and people, ultimately decides to return with the knowledge he has gained in China. Upon his return, he rallies together loyal followers and uses his newfound wisdom and prowess to defeat the traitors, reinstating peace and preserving the Pallava Dynasty’s rule. Inspired by the spiritual teachings he experienced in China, Bodhidharma reforms the empire's education and spiritual practices, leading to a great renaissance in arts, culture, and knowledge. The movie ends with King Selvaraj celebrating the newfound glory of the empire and entrusting his son, Bodhidharma, with the responsibility to lead the Pallava Dynasty to even greater heights. The film explores themes of self-discovery, family bonds, and the preservation of cultural heritage. The Chronicles of Pallava: Bodhidharma's Quest is an epic tale that captivates audiences with its unique blend of historical fiction, family drama, and adventure. By showcasing the rich history of the Pallava Dynasty, it encourages conversations about the untold stories of powerful cultural legacies from the past."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Imagine my surprise on learning I owed twice as much as I thought I did.","completion":"No, the term \\"surprise\\" is not used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences, even though both sentences involve an element of unexpectedness. In each sentence, surprise takes on a different context and connotation. In the first sentence, \\"The surprise attack was devastating,\\" the word \\"surprise\\" is used as an adjective to describe the nature of an attack. In this case, surprise means an unexpected and sudden action or event, particularly in a military context. A surprise attack typically happens without warning, with the intention of catching an enemy off-guard or unprepared. Consequently, surprise attacks often lead to the enemy experiencing significant damage or devastation. The focus in this sentence is on the unexpectedness of the attack and its destructive outcome. In the second sentence, \\"Imagine my surprise on learning I owed twice as much as I thought I did,\\" the word \\"surprise\\" refers to the feeling of astonishment or amazement experienced by the speaker at a discovery or realization. In this context, surprise is a noun that denotes a strong emotional reaction to a piece of information that was not anticipated. The sentence describes the speaker's shock at finding out that they owed a larger sum of money than they initially believed. The focus in this sentence is on the emotional response to the unexpected information, rather than the event or action itself. So, while both sentences address an element of unexpectedness, the first sentence refers to an unanticipated event (an attack) with physical implications, while the second sentence refers to an unexpected realization resulting in an emotional response from the speaker. The term \\"surprise\\" is used to convey different meanings in each sentence based on the context—a sudden event in the first sentence and an emotional reaction in the second."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For some, the idea of cutting Britain's ties with Europe is a way of returning the country to a simpler and more independent time. However, according new research, the British relationship with Europe dates back far further than was previously thought. Scientists have discovered that stone-age hunter gatherers in England were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to Britain. Researchers from the University of Warwick were able to isolate DNA from sediment core samples taken by divers from the sea floor below the cliffs on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, as shown in the picture above. They have found DNA for einkorn wheat buried within coastal sediments around the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests. Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory. The scientists also found changes in prehistoric technology, such as the adoption of farming, were linked with a significant influx of new people. For instance, in the Neolithic or New Stone Age, ancient central Europeans had an appearance closer to Sardinians. In the Iron Age, there is another shift, with people coming into Central Europe from the East, such as the Caucasus or Asia. Researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years after these people began dairying. Before then, most humans were lactose intolerant, and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk. However agriculture is not known to haarrived in Britain until around 6,000 years ago and scientists have found no evidence of wheat cultivation or pollen in the sediments. Instead they believe local hunter-gatherers bought the wheat by trading with European farmers from as far away as the south of France or the Balkans. This means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the European continent to Britain across an ancient land bridge. The scientists say that the discovery shows that Britain was no-where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought. They say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in Britain. Dr Robin Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick who led the research, said: 'Eight thousand years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe. 'Common throughout Neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff. 'For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between Mesolithic Britons and Neolithic farmers far across Europe. 'The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. 'As such, far from being insular, Mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe.' The researchers suggest the wheat was brought to Britain by neolithic traders from southern Europe. Einkorn wheat, like that pictured above, is thought to be one of the first plants to have been domesticated. The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Science, used new DNA extraction and analysis techniques to extract DNA from underwater sediments. They obtained sediment cores from Bouldnor Cliff on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, an area that had once been dry land before the end of the last ice age. Using the ancient sedimentary DNA, or sedaDNA, the scientists were able to reconstruct a picture of the plants and animals left behind there by the mesolithic people who inhabited the area. Among the native plants they found DNA sequences that matched those of near eastern strains of wheat. Professor Vince Gaffney, chair of landscape archaeology at the University of Bradford who was also involved in the study, said: 'We don't think it was grown here. We think it was traded across Europe. 'What that tells us is that these societies weren't isolated and they weren't simple. The scientists developed a new technique to extract DNA preserved in underwater sediments like above. 'Wheat, of course, is a signature for farming but this is 2,000 years before the onset of framing in Britain, and at this time the nearest farmers were either in the south of France or possibly as far away as the Balkans, thousands of miles across continental Europe. 'This tells us rather than the traditional model of farming arriving with colonists or some sort of invasion, the ideas and concepts of farming must have arrived several thousand years earlier.' Dr Greger Larson, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, said the technology used to extract DNA in the study could revolutionise our understanding of history. He said: 'The ability to sequence DNA no longer associated with the macroscopic remains from which it originated presents a range of possibilities that begins with a refinement of accepted chronologies. 'The unexpectedly early appearance of wheat in Britain should force a rethinking of both the strength of the relationships between early farmers and hunter-gatherers, and the origins of settled agricultural communities in Europe.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. The discovery of evidence of trading ties between Stone Age hunter-gatherers in England and continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago challenges previous theories about Britain's independence and isolation during that period. This evidence suggests Britain was involved in continental trade long before the advent of agriculture in the country. 2. Scientists from the University of Warwick extracted DNA from sediment samples taken from the sea floor near the Isle of Wight. They found DNA of Einkorn wheat, a variety not known to have been cultivated in Britain at that time. 3. The researchers believe that local hunter-gatherers obtained the wheat through trade, rather than cultivation, indicating the existence of established trade routes between Britain and Europe via an ancient land bridge. 4. The study also revealed insights into the evolution of lactose tolerance in early Europeans. It seemed to take about 5,000 years after the introduction of farming for Europeans' genes to evolve so they could digest the natural sugar in mammalian milk efficiently. 5. The adaptation and changes in prehistoric technology were linked with a significant influx of new people. The Bronze Age witnessed a shift in genetic makeup with more influences from Eastern regions like Caucasus or Asia. 6. These findings challenge the conventional thinking that farming was introduced to Britain parallel to the arrival of settlers. Instead, it suggests that the concept of farming probably reached the region several thousand years earlier through cultural exchange and trade. 7. The study's methodology, which involved a new technique of extracting DNA preserved in underwater sediments, could potentially revolutionize our understanding of history by refining accepted chronologies and reshaping ideas about early human communities. 8.

Choose a moisturizing cream formulated for hands or feet. Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin moisturized. You may also be able to find a barrier cream, such as Tetrix, that can help reduce your exposure to skin irritants. This can be helpful if you handle irritating substances, such as water, cement, or nickel, during your work. Corticosteroid creams are effective for pretty much any kind of eczema. Your doctor can prescribe you one that will help treat your flare-up. Use the cream after bathing, or try putting it on before you go to sleep. In fact, you can apply it at night and then put on cotton gloves, which will keep the cream on your hands. Scratching makes the rash worse. In addition, bursting the blisters also makes the rash worse. If you can let them heal instead of bursting them, your skin will likely heal faster. Unlike other types of eczema, water can irritate this rash, especially on your hands. Try to keep your hands out of water as much as possible. Sweating can also contribute to flare-ups. If you sweat a lot, your doctor may prescribe a treatment for this to help your eczema. Additionally, make sure to dry your hands thoroughly when you do get them wet. Metals such as nickel, chromium, and cobalt may also cause flare ups. You may be exposed to these metals if you work with concrete. Other chemicals from work or environmental exposure may also cause a flare-up. To keep your hands from this irritant, try wearing gloves. Calamine lotion can help soothe your rash. It can also calm the itching. You can also apply this lotion after washing your hands or bathing. You can find witch hazel at the drug store, usually near the rubbing alcohol. Witch hazel is an astringent. Soaking your hands in a bath of witch hazel can reduce skin inflammation and provide you with some relief during the healing process. This type of eczema can flare up when you're stressed out. Try to keep your stress levels down by incorporating calming routines into your life, such as a daily meditation regiment. Identify what causes you stress. Whether it's your job or even the evening news, identifying what makes you stressed out is the first step in dealing with it. Avoid or change what you can, such as skipping the news, and try to change your attitude about the rest. Try meditation. One simple way to meditate is pick a mantra. A mantra can be any simple phrase that calms you, such as \\"Life is good,\\" or even just \\"om.\\" Close your eyes, and repeat the phrase, letting your mind fill up with it. Continue until you feel calmer. Because this type of eczema is an immune response, immune-suppressing creams or pills can be effective. Some drugs in this class are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. Your doctor will decide whether creams or oral treatment will be more effective for you. This type of light treatment can help decrease the severity of a flare-up, especially when used in combination with medications to help you absorb the ultraviolet light used. Usually, this treatment is only used when others do not work.","completion":"This article talks about how to take care of a skin problem called dyshidrotic eczema. This type of eczema usually happens on hands and feet. To help with this, you can use special creams that make your skin feel better. You should avoid touching things that can make your skin feel worse, like water, cement, or metals. If you have this skin problem, it's important not to scratch, and to keep your hands clean and dry. You can try using things like calamine lotion or witch hazel to help with itching. Also, feeling stressed can make this skin problem worse, so try to relax and do calming activities like meditation. Sometimes, doctors can give you special medicines or treatments to help your skin feel better too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the author notice Barend? Options: A. because he was dirty and snotty, B. not enough information C. because he wore old clothes D. because he liked his shadow, Answer:","completion":"D. because he liked his shadow"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What two wars was Stafford a favorite of many of the servicemen?, using the article: While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I. Jo\\". On returning from the Pacific theater, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the U.S. troops homesick enough to surrender. She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen. Stafford was a favorite of many servicemen during both World War II and the Korean War; her recordings received extensive airplay on the American..., what would be the answer ?

To get rid of roaches use chalk to seal gaps, put out bait, or use boric acid powder.;","completion":"Alright, let's imagine our house is like a big toy box, and the roaches are naughty little bugs playing hide and seek inside it. We have two options to find and get rid of these naughty bugs: Option 1: We use chalk, like the one we use to draw on the sidewalk, to close the little doors and hidey holes they use to come in and out. We also put out some bait, like when we go fishing, but for the naughty bugs instead of fish. But this option also says to put food scraps around the house, which might not be a good idea because that is what the naughty bugs like to eat and it would actually keep them around. Option 2: We still use the chalk to close their little doors and hidey holes. We also put out the bait again, like a little trap to catch the naughty bugs. But this time, we use something called \\"boric acid powder\\", which is a special and safe bug-repelling dust. The naughty bugs don't like this dust, and if they walk in it or eat it, they will run away or won't feel good.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

One thing you need to do in order to build your self-esteem is to practice proper hygiene. In taking care of yourself, you will come to care for yourself more and more. To take care of yourself, you’ll need to practice proper hygiene. Wash your hair, and your skin regularly. Brush your teeth and your hair. Use deodorant. Wash your hands when needed. This will help you feel good about your body. If you or your family have a hard time paying for personal hygiene items, there are often many resources in the community where you can get them for free. Local churches and organizations will often have services that provide necessities. If they don’t, they may know where to look for help. Take care of your clothes. Wash them when they’re dirty and fold them to keep them from getting wrinkled. Don’t keep clothes that have a lot of holes or are ripped. Try to remove stains from clothing and if they can’t be removed, get rid of the clothes. Wear clothing that fits, not clothes that are too small or way too baggy. If you have problems getting new clothes, you can get clothing for free from many local churches and community outreach centers. Thrift stores will also have clothing that is much cheaper than what you’d pay in normal stores. If you’re worried that all you can find is outdated clothing, try thrift stores in nice towns or nice parts of town. Stores next to big colleges will be your best bet. This will increase your chances of finding clothes which are practically new and certainly nice enough to wear for many years. Teenage years are formative years, and many teens suffer from a deficit of sleep. You may think it's fine to skimp on sleep, but this practice actually has a serious impact on your health. Scientists have found that poor or little sleep is associated with lower rates of optimism and self-esteem. So if you want an easy way to boost your self-esteem as a teen, shoot to get at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night. A big part of feeling good in your own skin is exercising. Extra fat or generally being out of shape can make you feel sluggish, out of breath, or just unpleasant. Exercise will help you feel more energetic and healthier. Anything which gets your heart rate up for at least ten minutes is exercise. Work out by jogging, doing push-ups and crunches, or doing squats. Anything that works for you is perfectly fine... just be consistent and don’t give up! Eating healthy, like exercising, will lead you to feel better in your own skin. Eating a lot of junk food will weigh you down and make you feel sluggish and sick. Eating healthy food will give you more energy and you’ll feel much happier. In feeling better, you’ll be able to feel better about yourself. Summary:","completion":"To build self-esteem, it's important to take care of yourself.

(AP) — Republican Ed Gillespie on Friday conceded the Virginia Senate race to the Democratic incumbent, Mark Warner, and said he would not seek a recount in the tight race even though state law entitled him to one. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., waves to the crowd with his wife, Lisa Collis during an election party in Arlington, Va., Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014. Warner is locked in a tight race with Republican Ed Gillespie.... (Associated Press) Virginia Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie tells his supporters that the race is too close to call at his election night party in Springfield, Va., Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2014. Gillespie is running... (Associated Press) \\"The votes just aren't there,\\" Gillespie told his supporters, adding that he called Warner earlier in the day to congratulate him. The latest numbers from the State Board of Elections show Warner leading by more than 16,000 votes, or nearly a percentage point, out of more than 2 million ballots cast. Warner has 49 percent of the vote, Gillespie has 48 percent and Libertarian Robert Sarvis has 2 percent. Warner, a former governor who is one of Virginia's most popular politicians, had been expected to handily win a second term. But Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman, rode a wave of support for GOP candidates nationwide, and almost knocked Warner out of the Senate despite being outspent heavily. On Thursday, Warner told reporters he was confident that his lead would hold up. He said it would be unprecedented in Virginia for such a lead to evaporate in either the canvass, as the formal counting process is called, or a recount. Warner said he was focusing now on his next term, which would begin in January, and planned to promote a centrist agenda that could attract bipartisan support. He said he wants \\"to show that we can get the Senate to actually work.\\" Gillespie's concession did not change the balance of the Senate. Tuesday's elections put Republicans in control with at least 52 of 100 seats in the chamber. The Alaska race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and GOP challenger Dan Sullivan remains uncalled, and in Louisiana, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican Bill Cassidy are competing in a Dec. 6 runoff. ||||| SPRINGFIELD, Va. — Ed Gillespie, who nearly pulled off an upset in Virginia’s Senate race, conceded the battle Friday to Democratic incumbent Mark Warner. The former Republican National Committee head also told POLITICO this week that he isn’t planning to run for governor, despite predictions he would do so if he failed to reach the Senate. Text Size - + reset Gillespie trailed Warner by 16,000 votes on Election Day, a 0.8 percent margin. Most observers expected Warner to prevail, and the senator retained Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias in preparation for a potential recount. (PHOTOS: Election Day 2014) The unexpectedly close contest led to hand-wringing in GOP circles about what might’ve been if they’d just poured more money or resources into the Virginia race. The GOP wave that swept the nation Tuesday, combined with a seemingly complacent Warner camp, nearly carried Gillespie’s longshot bid over the line. But Gillespie acknowledged Friday that Warner’s lead appeared likely to hold, noting that it had grown to nearly 17,000 as votes were canvassed. The Associated Press called the race in Warner’s favor as Gillespie was conceding. “I’ve called Mark Warner this morning to congratulate him on his reelection, to thank him for his public service for our Commonwealth,” Gillespie said in a news conference in this Washington, D.C., suburb. He added that he did not think a recount would make a difference. “If I believed there were any conceivable way that we could find a viable way to win through a recount, I’d fight as hard as I have,” he said. “In my head and in my heart, I know that a change in outcome is not possible.” (Senate results by state) Gillespie also thanked supporters, noting that “many of them were tea party voters who were initially skeptical of my candidacy … their concerns are my concerns and my concerns are theirs.” “These patriotic Americans are often wrongly marginalized and even demonized in the media,” said Gillespie, who left the news conference without taking questions. The governor’s seat in Virginia is currently held by Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who, according to state law, is not eligible to run for a second consecutive term. But Gillespie said in an interview Thursday that he has no designs on the job. “There are a lot of people thinking about running for governor in 2017. And I’m not one of them,” Gillespie said. (WATCH: Election Day 2014 videos) Asked about the speculation that he took on the long-shot Senate bid to set himself up for the governor’s race, Gillespie argued that talk was driven by a hungry media. “Content must be provided. And so people have to provide content,” he said. “And this is what people do in this click driven media environment. Instead of just reporting the facts as they are, you’ve got to make some stuff up that might get some clicks on your website.” Gillespie in the interview also demurred when asked if he’d consider another Senate run in 2018, when Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine’s term is up. “I’ve got one campaign in me. This was my campaign. And I feel like we’ve done it really really well,” he said. The results in the 2014 Senate race also drew renewed focus on the wildly inaccurate polls that showed Warner — a popular politician who cast himself as a moderate — winning by a wide margin. Even Republican pollsters missed the mark. Republicans lamented that the errant polls may have diminished enthusiasm for Gillespie’s bid and hurt his chances. Earlier Friday, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said he was baffled by how public pollsters botched the race so badly. Priebus also said he had spoken with Gillespie a day earlier, but that Gillespie hadn’t foreshadowed his plans to drop out. Priebus said the RNC had been prepared “with whatever we can do to help” Gillespie. Exit polls suggested that as many as a third of all voters in Virginia hadn’t made up their minds until October, and many of them were undecided until the final few days of the race. The bulk likely broke toward Gillespie, catching Democrats off-guard. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Alright, let me explain this simply. There was a really close election in Virginia for a Senator position. The candidates were Ed Gillespie, a Republican, and Mark Warner, a Democrat. Many people thought Mark Warner was going to win easily, but it turned out to be a very close race. In the end, Mark Warner won, and Ed Gillespie decided not to ask for a recount because he didn't think the results would change.

Article:","completion":"Title: Shakeup at Police Federation Amid Spending Scandals and Plebgate Connection In a significant shakeup at the top, Chairman Steve Williams and General Secretary Ian Rennie of the Police Federation are expected to step down from their posts. Their decision to resign comes in the wake of criticism surrounding the lavish spending habits and alleged drunken excess of officials within the organization. This move follows revelations that both the Chairman and General Secretary were aware of a £10,000 campaign to oppose coalition reforms within the police. Interestingly, the tactics had been agreed on and implemented just weeks before the infamous Plebgate scandal broke. Plebgate significantly tarnished the reputation of the police and raised questions about their integrity and commitment to transparency. The Police Federation, which represents over 120,000 rank-and-file officers, has come under increased scrutiny as more details emerge about controversial financial arrangements. It is alleged that vast sums of the union's funds have been stashed in mysterious off-shore bank accounts, making it difficult for the average stakeholder to grasp the organization's financial standing. Furthermore, reports of lavish spending on credit cards by senior officials within the Police Federation have surfaced, suggesting a breach of trust and potential misuse of union funds. These funds were supposed to be allocated to support member welfare and other essential services. Adding to the organization's woes, a senior Federation official has been identified as a self-confessed bigamist, further marring the image of the law enforcement institution already grappling with trust issues. The controversies extend beyond issues of finances and personal conduct. It has been revealed that a secret Freemason's lodge was created within the Federation's £26 million luxury headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey. The existence of such a lodge raises questions about the organization's commitment to transparency and hints at potential backroom dealings. The resignation of Williams and Rennie may be a first step in addressing the numerous scandals plaguing the Police Federation. However, it is crucial for the organization to implement comprehensive reforms, provide full financial transparency, and ensure better standards of conduct among its officials if it is to rebuild trust and credibility with the public."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Had this custody drama played out in the United States, Christopher Savoie might be considered a hero -- snatching his two little children back from an ex-wife who defied the law and ran off with them. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. But this story unfolds 7,000 miles away in the Japanese city of Fukuoka, where the U.S. legal system holds no sway. And here, Savoie sits in jail, charged with the abduction of minors.

Concerned, Savoie called his ex-wife's father in","completion":"Japan, seeking some reassurance regarding the children's safety and well-being. His ex-father-in-law tried to calm Savoie's worries, assuring him that the kids were in good hands and well taken care of. Still, Savoie couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. Desperate to reunite with his children, he made the grueling journey to Fukuoka, hoping to leverage the support of the American consulate and local authorities. However, he soon realized that the cultural differences between the two countries complicated matters, as Japanese laws prioritized the mother's rights in cases of divorce and child custody. Undeterred, Savoie devised a plan to retrieve his children after learning about their daily routines in Fukuoka. One fateful morning, as his ex-wife took Isaac and Rebecca to their school, Savoie seized the opportunity and scooped up the kids in a daring operation. Together, they rushed to the U.S. consulate, seeking refuge and help in their quest to go back home to Tennessee. However, Savoie's troubles were far from over. Local Japanese police, acting on a complaint filed by his ex-wife, arrested him outside the consulate on charges of abducting minors. The U.S. officials inside the consulate were powerless against the decision of Japanese law enforcement. As the story unfolded, it captured international attention, shedding light on the complex and contentious issue of international child custody battles. In this tale of two legal systems, Christopher Savoie was caught in the middle, as a father yearning for his children and a man entangled in a web of conflicting laws and cultural norms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

Article: At every stage of creating and maintaining a political party, you’ll need lots of enthusiastic involvement. Let others know that you are interested in starting a new party, and ask them to get involved. You could try starting out by holding a meeting with people you already know in a community center or even at your home. If there’s interest in creating a new party, tell them to spread the word to people they know. Hold a second, larger meeting inviting these people, too. Ensure attendance at all meetings. When officially filing your party, you’ll typically need to prove that you’ve been holding meetings. It’s never too early to start soliciting donations. At the early stages, you can start a crowdfunding campaign. Later, you can have your financial team set up a more formal donation process. You might want to start a political party to draw attention to a great candidate for office, and to help them get elected. If you have a charismatic candidate you would like to promote, ask them to attend your meetings. They can give speeches, take promotional photos, greet constituents, and generally increase the buzz about the formation of your new party. You can start by having discussions at your meetings about what your party wants to emphasize. Generate a list of your principles, and designate a member or a committee to draw these up. Share them with the whole group, make any necessary changes, and vote to officially adopt the platform. Address things like: What aspects of political, social, or economic life would your party like to improve? What would your party want to accomplish if elected to office? What sets your party apart from others? Why would voters want to support your party’s candidates? A political party is a complex organization, and hopefully one that will grow over time. To keep things manageable, you’ll need to establish another committee to write bylaws. When they’re drafted, share them with everyone before voting to approve them. You’ll often also need to share these when officially filing. Bylaws will discuss things like: Who is the party’s leadership? How will they be elected? What committees will be formed? How do members vote on important issues? How will candidates be chosen? How will disagreements be handled? When will meetings be held, and what form will they take? It takes money to organize a political party and promote candidates for elections. Your party will need rules for how money will come in, who will oversee it, and how it will be used. When officially filing your party, you will probably need to provide a statement of your financial scheme and an explanation of your accounting, so it’s a good idea to write these early. Consider: How will donations be generated? What account or accounts will money be held in? Which committee will be in charge of finances? Who will provide your accounting services? What guidelines do you want to set for things like how money can be spent on election campaigns? What procedures will you have for ensuring financial transparency? How will you handle any financial disagreements or investigations?

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling.

Question: Question: \\"What relaxing practice is important to most Buddhists?\\" Context: \\"Zen Buddhism (禅), pronounced Chán in Chinese, seon in Korean or zen in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term dhyāna, meaning \\"meditation\\") is a form of Buddhism that became popular in China, Korea and Japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation.[note 12] Zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of Buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The relaxing practice that is important to most Buddhists, particularly in Zen Buddhism, is meditation. Meditation is a practice in which individuals train their minds to cultivate mindfulness, concentration, and insight, leading to mental and emotional tranquility. In Zen Buddhism, the practice of meditation is considered central to developing a deeper understanding of one's self and the nature of reality. Two primary forms of meditation are typically practiced in Zen Buddhism: 1. Zazen (坐禅): This form of seated meditation is fundamental to Zen practice. Zazen involves sitting in a comfortable posture, focusing on breath, and allowing thoughts to pass without engaging or reacting to them. The goal of zazen is to develop a heightened sense of mental clarity and physical relaxation, ultimately leading to a state of pure, undistracted awareness. 2. Koan practice: A koan is a story, dialogue, or question that Zen practitioners contemplate as a means of breaking through their conceptual thinking and achieving insights into the nature of reality. Koans often appear paradoxical or nonsensical, requiring the meditator to move beyond intellectual analysis to find the inherent wisdom within. Through contemplating koans, practitioners seek to shift their perspective, enabling them to experience a direct understanding of the truth. These meditation practices are important to most Buddhists because they facilitate the development of mental peace, inner wisdom, and compassion. By regularly engaging in meditation, Buddhists aim to reduce suffering, cultivate empathy for others, and gain profound insights into the interconnectedness of all things. This emphasis on direct spiritual breakthroughs is what distinguishes Zen Buddhism from other Buddhist traditions, which may place greater importance on the study of scriptures and the teachings of the Buddha."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Continue the following story. He put the dollar bill in the drawer instead of his pocket, because the","completion":"man had grown tired of carrying around loose change and crumpled bills. The drawer, a heavy oak piece that had been in his family for generations, seemed to be the perfect place for such items. He closed it with a satisfying click, the faint scent of polished wood and generations of memories escaping from its depths. The room was dimly lit, with streams of sunlight filtering in through the worn and tattered curtains, highlighting the floating dust motes that danced their languid waltz in the air. With the sun continuing its slow descent toward the horizon, he decided it was time to head out. Slipping into his worn, leather jacket and fishing his wallet from the table, the man grabbed his keys, careful not to disturb the multiple framed photographs that stood proudly next to them. Each one told a different story – of family members long past, of friends who had come and gone, and most important of all, of the love and life he had experienced within these hallowed walls. Feeling the weight of his memories, the man paused for a moment, glancing around the room. A sense of melancholy gripped his chest, and his eyes clouded with tears. The bitter-sweet feeling of nostalgia gnawed at him, a constant reminder of the impermanence of life and the transience of human relationships. Shaking off the feeling, he put on his well-worn boots, their leathery exterior bringing back the memory of his first time learning to ride a motorcycle. His heart raced at the thought of those early days, the wind whipping through his hair as he defied conventional norms, riding far and wide, exploring hidden pockets of a world too often rushed through. He ached to feel the same sense of wonder and freedom that he had so long ago, when he looked upon the open road without any trepidation or fear. But life had happened, and the wild, rebellious young man he had once been had slowly given way to a more cautious, sensible adult. His adventures had become fewer and farther between, as he focused more on building a stable foundation for his life. The motorcycle, once a symbol of unbridled freedom, had been replaced by a modest, reliable car, a testament to the practicality that had infiltrated his existence. As he walked out the door, he was greeted by the familiar sight of his old, worn-down house. Overgrown shrubs and patches of ivy clung to the bricks like a living memory of the years that had passed. The weight of the past continued to tug at his heart, but somewhere deep inside, a fire of defiance still flickered. With newfound determination, he climbed into his car and drove away, on a quest to rediscover that long-lost spirit of adventure and to reignite the passion that had once burned so brightly. As the surroundings whizzed by, he marveled at the beauty of the world that he had taken for granted, the colors of the sunset bleeding together in a breathtaking symphony. Along his journey, he sought out the forgotten highways and dusty back roads that others had often overlooked. He met new friends and experienced heart-stopping moments of peril and fear, but he also found solace in the open expanse of the world. And as he slowly traversed the landscape of his heart and soul, with every new experience etched beneath his skin and engrained in his memory, the man began to feel something he hadn't in years – the warmth of the sun breaking through the windows of his heart, a light reemerging from within the dusty confines of life. He put the dollar bill in the drawer so that when he returned, it would remind him not of the things he left behind, but of the journey he had decided to embark upon. A journey that would not change the past, but would create new stories, new memories, and ultimately, infuse his life with the very essence he had yearned for – the ability to truly live, with abandon, fervor, and a heart that was no longer confined by the limitations of the drawer or the weight of days gone by."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the United Nations Statistics Division scheme of geographic regions, 20 territories constitute Eastern Africa: - The Hutu , also known as the Abahutu, are a population inhabiting the African Great Lakes region. They mainly live in Rwanda, Burundi, and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they form one of the principal population divisions alongside the Tutsi and the Twa. - Pierre Ngendandumwe ( 1930 -- January 15 , 1965 ) was a Burundian political figure . He was a member of the Union for National Progress and was an ethnic Hutu . On June 18 , 1963 , about a year after Burundi gained independence and amidst efforts to bring about political cooperation between Hutus and the dominant minority Tutsis , Ngendandumwe became Burundi 's first Hutu prime minister . He served as prime minister until April 6 , 1964 and then became prime minister again on January 7 , 1965 , serving until his death . Just 8 days after beginning his second term , he was assassinated by a Rwandan Tutsi refugee who is believed to have been employed at the American embassy in Burundi . The assassination led to a renewed escalation of unrest between Tutsis and Hutus . His Hutu successor , Joseph Bamina was executed on 15 December 1965 . - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water. - The Bantu languages, technically the Narrow Bantu languages (as opposed to \\"Wide Bantu\\", a loosely defined categorization which includes other Bantoid languages), constitute a traditional branch of the NigerCongo languages. There are about 250 Bantu languages by the criterion of mutual intelligibility, though the distinction between language and dialect is often unclear, and \\"Ethnologue\\" counts 535 languages. Bantu languages are spoken largely east and south of present-day Cameroon, that is, in the regions commonly known as Central Africa, Southeast Africa, and Southern Africa. Parts of the Bantu area include languages from other language families (see map). - Bujumbura, formerly Usumbura, is the capital, largest city, and main port of Burundi. It ships most of the country's chief export, coffee, as well as cotton and tin ore. It is on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, the second deepest lake in the world after Lake Baikal. - Central Africa is a core region of the African continent which includes Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda. Middle Africa (as used by the United Nations when categorising geographic subregions) is an analogous term that includes Angola, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and São Tomé and Príncipe. All of the states in the UN subregion of Middle Africa, plus those otherwise commonly reckoned in Central Africa (11 states in total), constitute the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). Since its independence in 2011, South Sudan has also been commonly included in the region. - Rwanda (or ), officially the Republic of Rwanda, is a sovereign state in central and east Africa and one of the smallest countries on the African mainland.

The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year. - Lake Tanganyika is an African Great Lake. It is estimated to be the second largest freshwater lake in the world by volume, and the second deepest, in both cases, after only Lake Baikal in Siberia; it is also the world's longest freshwater lake. The lake is divided among four countries Tanzania, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Zambia, with Tanzania (46%) and DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake. The water flows into the Congo River system and ultimately into the Atlantic Ocean. - Uganda (or ), officially the Republic of Uganda, is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania.

It is also considered part of Central Africa. Burundi's capital is Bujumbura. The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika. - The Union for National Progress (UPRONA) is a nationalist political party in Burundi, receiving most of its support from members of the Tutsi ethnic group. It is celebrated for its role in gaining Burundian independence. - The Democratic Republic of the Congo , also known as DR Congo, DRC, DROC, East Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo is a country located in Central Africa. From 1971 to 1997 it was named, and is sometimes still called Zaire, and from 1908 to 1960 it was called the Belgian Congo. The DRC borders the Central African Republic, and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania to the east; Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest. It is the second-largest country in Africa by area and eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 80 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populated officially Francophone country, the fourth most-populated nation in Africa and the eighteenth most populated country in the world. - The Tutsi, or Abatutsi, are a population inhabiting the African Great Lakes region. Historically, they were often referred to as the Watutsi, Watusi, Wahuma or the Wahima. The Tutsi form a subgroup of the Banyarwanda and the Barundi peoples, who reside primarily in Rwanda and Burundi, but with significant populations also found in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. They speak Rwanda-Rundi, a group of Bantu languages. - Banyarwanda (Kinyarwanda plural: \\"Abanyarwanda\\", singular: \\"Umunyarwanda\\"; literally \\"those who come from Rwanda\\") actually means the people of Hutu, Tutsi and Batwa. Some lived on the present territory of the DRC before colonization, while others have migrated from neighboring Rwanda in waves. They live in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. There are 1 million Banyarwanda in Uganda. They live in Western Uganda; Umutara and Kitara are the centers of their pastoral and agricultural areas. - Joseph Bamina (1925 15 December 1965) was a Burundian politician and member of the Union for National Progress (French: Union pour le Progrès national) (UPRONA) party. Bamina was Prime Minister from 26 January to 30 September 1965, and President of the Senate of Burundi in 1965. He and other leaders of the government were assassinated on 15 December 1965, by Tutsi soldiers during a reprisal effort to stop a coup by Hutu officers. - A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 48 such countries, including four partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World). - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east.

Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \\"I'm watching you!\\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \\"A. Friend\\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is.

Question: I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Now, I have a new situation: Two teams of athletes were attending a competition. Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured. Answer this question please: Which team experienced fewer muscle injuries? Answer:","completion":"The Brown team experienced fewer muscle injuries during the competition. This conclusion can be drawn based on the information provided about the importance of warming up before engaging in any physical activity. Warming up serves as a crucial preparation step for muscles and tendons, helping to prevent injuries during exercise or sports activities. By gradually increasing the intensity of the activity, the warm-up process aids in increasing blood flow to the muscles and elevating the heart rate. This, in turn, helps to ensure that the muscles and tendons are more pliable and less susceptible to injury. In the given situation, the Brown team arrived on time and responsibly performed their warm-up routine before the competition began. Their muscles and tendons were more prepared for the challenges and exertion of the competitive event than those of the Green team. On the other hand, the Green team, unfortunately, arrived late and consequently, decided to skip their warm-up session. By doing so, they made themselves vulnerable to muscle injuries due to their unprepared muscles and tendons prone to damage resulting from sudden physical exertion. It is essential to note that even elite athletes, irrespective of their skill and fitness level, need to follow a proper warm-up routine to ensure their body is ready for the physical demands of their respective activities. The example illustrated by the two teams reinforces the significance of incorporating warm-up sessions as a part of an athlete's preparation process, ultimately reducing the likelihood of muscle injuries. In summary, the Brown team's proactive approach to warming up before the competition resulted in fewer muscle injuries compared to the Green team, which skipped the essential step."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: It's rare that I come across a film this awful, this annoying and this irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot, when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing, is ludicrous. Why did Domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? Because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this \\"traumatic\\" event left her emotionally stunted, and hating everyone. When the dialogue is not clichéd or banal, it's littered with laughable lines such as: \\"There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich... the poor... and everyone else\\". At one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. At another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy. Keira Knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. Mickey Rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess. I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance being one, but all I could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer strongly expresses frustration, disappointment, and even irritation with the film. They describe it as \\"awful,\\" \\"annoying,\\" \\"irritating,\\" and \\"one of the worst films I've ever seen.\\" Several major criticisms are directed at the plot, dialogue, and casting choices. The plot is described as \\"ludicrous\\" and ridden with \\"confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing.\\" The dialogue is labeled as clichéd, banal, and full of laughable lines that detract from the overall viewing experience. The casting choices, particularly Keira Knightley, are seen as unconvincing and mismatched for their roles, which further contributes to the reviewer's dissatisfaction. The reviewer also addresses specific instances from the film that exemplify their frustrations with the plot, dialogue, and characters. Examples like blowing off someone's arm instead of reading a tattooed number and threatening to set off a bomb in a meeting with the mafia are mentioned to further highlight the absurdity and implausibility of certain scenarios. The review does mention a positive aspect; Mickey Rourke is credited with salvaging \\"some credibility\\" from the otherwise disastrous film. Comparing this film to Tony Scott's previous works, the reviewer expresses their enjoyment of movies like True Romance.

The first thing you need to do is sterilize the scissors you will be using to snip off the skin tag. You can do this using a few different methods. The most thorough way is to use an autoclave (sterilization device) but you may not have one readily available and they can be expensive to buy. Cheaper alternatives include thoroughly cleaning the scissors with some rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball, or boiling the scissors in a pot of water for ten minutes. Wash your hands with an anti-bacterial soap and carefully place the sterilized scissors on a clean towel and leave to dry. Avoid touching the sterilized blade from this point on. This will extend the skin tag and give you more space to get the scissors as close to the base of the tag as possible. Before you do this, you can numb the area with a little ice to minimize pain, however removing the skin tag is no more painful than a pinch, so this is probably unnecessary. Position the scissors slowly and carefully to ensure that you will snip the skin tag as close to the base as possible, without cutting the surrounding skin. Once you are in position, snip quickly to minimize pain. It should feel like a quick pinch. Instead of using sterilized scissors, it is possible to use a nail clippers to remove the skin tag instead. The nail clippers may be easier to use if the skin tag is on the back of your neck, or anywhere hard to reach. Just be sure to sterilize the nail clippers using one of the methods outlined above before using. The base of the skin tag will probably bleed a little after cutting, but this is normal. Take care to disinfect the area before covering, as the last thing you want is to develop an infection. Use a little rubbing alcohol or iodine on a cotton ball to do this. Cover the area with a skin-colored band-aid and allow the skin tag at least 24 hours to heal. If any signs of infection should develop, such as swelling, tenderness, redness or oozing around the wound, consult your doctor immediately. Summary:","completion":"This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to safely remove a skin tag at home using sterilized scissors or nail clippers, emphasizing the importance of sterilization, careful cutting, and proper aftercare to prevent infection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: Background Paragraph: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes. Student:","completion":"In the small town of Greenfield, Farmer Jones was known for growing the most delicious and nutritious tomatoes in the region. He always kept up with the latest advancements in agriculture to ensure the best crop yields for his beloved community. One day, Farmer Jones learned about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their potential benefits, including increased durability, nutritional content, insect resistance, and herbicide tolerance. Farmer Jones started researching this new technology and decided to try growing two types of genetically modified tomatoes alongside his regular crop. For the first type, he used herbicide-resistant seeds which allowed the plants to withstand exposure to herbicides. This meant he could control weeds without harming his crop. The second type consisted of insect-resistant seeds, which had a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This gene produced a toxin that was specifically effective against insects, protecting the crop from damage. As the growing season progressed, Farmer Jones saw significant benefits from his GMO crop. The herbicide-resistant tomatoes were keeping the weeds at bay, and the insect-resistant tomatoes remained untouched by pesky bugs. However, he also noticed some drawbacks. The herbicide-resistant tomatoes seemed to be suffering from iron deficiencies, which affected their growth and nutritional content. Additionally, local legislation surrounding the use of GMOs meant he had to closely monitor and adhere to strict safety guidelines. One day, Farmer Jones met a fellow farmer named Lucy, who had a solution to his problems. She suggested that instead of solely relying on GMO crops, he could also explore traditional breeding practices, like hybridization and cross-pollination with wild tomato species. Lucy had successfully bred tomato plants that were resistant to at least 19 diseases, simply by crossing them with wild populations of tomatoes. Excited about this new possibility, Farmer Jones decided to combine both technological advancements and traditional practices. He continued to utilize the benefits of GMO crops while also implementing sustainable and eco-friendly farming methods to address potential concerns. With his innovative approach, Farmer Jones managed to improve his tomato crop's quality and resilience over the years, while also meeting the varying requirements of food safety and labeling both locally and internationally. Farmer Jones' tomatoes became even more famous, and eventually, were known far and wide as the perfect blend of science and nature. In this story, we see implications from the background paragraph concerning GMOs, such as their potential benefits, drawbacks, regulations, and incorporation of traditional breeding practices into modern farming techniques."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: Assessing the Actions The first sentence indicates that Ronnie Biggs has suffered a massive heart attack and is struggling to survive, while the second sentence means that after receiving treatment for pneumonia in the hospital, he was brought back to prison. Step 3: Contextual Understanding Considering the context, what these sentences tell us about Ronnie Biggs and his condition are at different times and different circumstances, which further supports they do not mean the same.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: On 18 February 1914 The Rite received its first concert performance (the music without the ballet), in St Petersburg under Serge Koussevitzky. On 5 April that year, Stravinsky experienced for himself the popular success of The Rite as a concert work, at the Casino de Paris. After the performance, again under Monteux, the composer was carried in triumph from the hall on the shoulders of his admirers. The Rite had its first British concert performance on 7 June 1921, at the Queen's Hall in London under Eugene Goossens. Its American premiere occurred on 3 March 1922, when Stokowski included it in a Philadelphia Orchestra programme. Goossens was also responsible for introducing The Rite to Australia on 23 August 1946 at the Sydney Town Hall, as guest conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.Stravinsky first conducted the work in 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later he brought it to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that \\"thanks to the experience I had gained with all kinds of orchestras ... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it\\". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as \\"the most important piece of music of the 20th century\\".In 1963, 50 years after the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a commemorative performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, a close friend of the composer, Stravinsky informed him that he had no intention of hearing his music being \\"murdered by that frightful butcher\\". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent... answer the following question: What is the last name of the ballet that the composer performed which led to him being carried on the shoulders of his admirers?

Determine the sentiment: The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig. To be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. Finally, I don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's a laughable, ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles.

In Test A, David used low temperature for the steam engine.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes.

Article: When you travel in South America, you'd better pay attention to the following three kinds of dangerous South American animals. Piranhas Although only a small number of piranhas are considered to be dangerous to humans, the red-bellied piranha is definitely one of those. Evidence has shown that a large group of piranhas can absolutely eat a herd of large animals crossing the river, leaving only bones. This fish lives in the freshwater streams of South America, and they can smell the blood from far away and launch attacks swiftly. It is said that they are only dangerous to humans if the water volumes are less and lower. Anacondas This South American monster of a creature often appears in the films or your nightmares!They have weighed over 230 kilograms. It is often considered to be the biggest snake in the world. You certainly don't want to get caught alone with this snake due to its method of attacking and killing its victim. It is indeed a remarkably different brand of snake type as it regularly coils around all over its target, increasing the pressure until eventually its victim dies. Its jaws are powered by large muscles that produce enough power for its over 100 sharp teeth to pass through the thick skin of an crocodile. They don't have poison. Sometimes they prefer to camouflage themselves so they look like their surroundings and swiftly draw back when humans are near. Golden Poisonous Frogs The golden poison frog might be the most-deadly of the South American animal, which is protected by means of poison. This very small frog, less than 55 mm in length, packs enough punch to take down a pair of African bull elephants. This apparently harmless frog has always been known to have killed people who have touched it directly. It's also been noted that chicken and dogs have died by contacting things on which a golden poison frog had wandered! In intense colors, they normally look attractive to their targets. Question: What can we learn about piranhas from the passage? - Piranhas are the most dangerous animals. - Piranhas like to live in the deep seabed. - Piranhas may attack human beings when the water level is low. - Piranhas only attack human beings when they cross the river in groups.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other? Select from the following. A). no B). yes","completion":"A). No These two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. The concept of paraphrasing involves rewording a sentence or phrase while retaining the same meaning. In these instances, the two sentences present different information in terms of the familial origins and their subsequent movements. The first sentence states, \\"Before going to Lebanon, her family was originally from Acre, Palestine.\\" This implies that her family was initially located in Acre, Palestine, before they moved to Lebanon. On the other hand, the second sentence reads, \\"Before travelling to Palestine, her family was originally from Acre, Lebanon.\\" In this case, the sentence suggests that the family’s roots were in Acre, Lebanon, before they moved to Palestine. To summarize, the first sentence denotes a move from Acre, Palestine to Lebanon. The second sentence implies a relocation from Acre, Lebanon to Palestine. Therefore, the order of movements and the geographical origins are different, and these sentences are not paraphrases of each other. They tell different stories about the family’s migrations and origins.

Input: Context: Brain injury after hypoxic-ischemic insults evolves via an apoptotic/necrotic cascade. Glutamate over release and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor over activation (excitotoxicity) are believed to trigger this process. Xenon is a nontoxic anesthetic gas that reduces neurotransmitter release and functionally antagonizes NMDA receptors. Administering xenon to hypoxic-ischemic newborns might be clinically effective if the neurotoxic processes continue evolving after delivery. We sought to determine whether xenon administration after the initial hypoxic-ischemic insult was neuroprotective.', 'Fifty 7-day-old rats received a 90-minute hypoxic insult after unilateral carotid ligation.

Options: - two legs - feathers - entertain yourself - head - two wings The answer is \\"two wings\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer is \\"two wings\\" because birds have specifically adapted appendages called wings, which enable them to take flight and maneuver in the air. These wings, found on both sides of a bird's body, consist of a complex structure of bones, muscles, and feathers that work together to produce lift and thrust, allowing the bird to defy gravity and move through the skies. To understand why \\"two wings\\" is the correct answer, let's look at each option in detail: 1. Two legs: While a bird's legs are essential for activities such as walking, running, or perching, they are not responsible for propelling the bird into flight. Bird legs primarily provide support and balance on land and help them to grab on to branches or other surfaces. 2. Feathers: Although feathers play a vital role in enabling birds to fly, they are not the primary body part that initiates flight. Birds possess different types of feathers that serve various purposes like insulation, waterproofing, and display. Flight feathers located on their wings help maintain lift, stability, and create streamlined surfaces during flight. However, it is the actual movement of the wings that allows the bird to take off, not just the presence of feathers. 3. Entertain yourself: This option is illogical and unrelated to the question about the bird's flight. It does not point to any part of a bird's anatomy that aids in flight. 4. Head: While the bird's head is essential for maintaining balance, vision, and sensing its environment, it does not actively contribute to the bird taking flight. The head houses vital sensory organs such as eyes, ears, and a beak that help the bird locate food, communicate, and adapt to its environment. However, these functions do not propel the bird into the air. 5. Two wings: As stated earlier, the bird's two wings are responsible for initiating flight and enabling them to move through the air. Wings consist of a strong, lightweight framework of bones and muscles that allow for a wide range of motion. Birds flap their wings upwards and downwards in a coordinated manner, generating lift and forward motion. Additionally, the shape of the wings and the arrangement of flight feathers help create necessary air pressure patterns, propelling the bird into flight. In conclusion, among all the given options, \\"two wings\\" is the correct answer explaining how a bird takes flight. The wings, with their complex structure and unique adaptations, allow birds to move through the air efficiently and effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These elusive, enigmatic individuals strike fear into the hearts of their opponents through their mastery of the chakram—a deadly, circular throwing weapon that combines agility, precision, and lethality. Emerging from the shadows, these warriors execute their potent moves through a combination of sneak attacks, fiery barricades, and devastating strikes that leave their adversaries in shock and awe. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the lore and strategies of these formidable opponents, equip readers with vital knowledge and techniques to tackle them in battles, and provide expert insights on how to overcome their lethal moves. We invite you to embark on a journey of discovery as we unravel the secrets of facing the Chakram Warriors. Chakram Attacks: A Warrior's Signature Move No warrior worth their salt can ignore the chakram, the weapon that lends its name to the Chakram Warriors. These metallic disc-shaped weapons boast razor-sharp edges and impeccable balance, allowing their wielders to launch them at high speeds with incredible accuracy. Chakram Warriors have honed their skills to perfection, able to execute a deadly dance of spinning and flying chakrams that can slice through the air and opponents alike. To counter these vicious attacks, it's crucial to sharpen your reflexes and anticipation. Chakram attacks come in different forms—some can ricochet off various surfaces to strike their target, others might come flying in rapid succession or even return to the thrower like a boomerang. Keep a keen eye on the Chakram Warrior's movements and stance, as positioning and body language can often telegraph an incoming attack. Seek cover when possible, and never underestimate the range and reach of a chakram. The Art of Detecting the Sneak Attack As aptly named, Chakram Warriors are also notorious for their stealth and cunning, enabling them to employ sneak attacks that catch their foes off-guard. Blink, and you might miss them slipping into the shadows, only to re-emerge with an ambush that could strike at any given moment. Often silent and unseen, they utilize the environment to their advantage, employing smoke bombs, distractions, or simply sheer speed to confound their enemies. To avoid becoming a victim to their sneak attacks, one must always maintain 360-degree awareness, as a Chakram Warrior can strike from any angle. Make use of audio cues: the rustle of leaves, the crunch of sand or gravel, or the thud of boots across a wooden floor can betray an approaching attack. Furthermore, employ preventive measures such as laying traps or securing your surroundings to limit the Chakram Warrior's mobility. Anticipation is your greatest ally against their cunning. Surviving the Fiery Barricade and Floor One of the most intimidating techniques in a Chakram Warrior's arsenal is the creation of fiery barricades and floors. By harnessing their inner energy, they can ignite the surroundings with a flick of their wrist or a well-placed strike, trapping their enemy within a blazing inferno. Here, the Chakram Warrior can attack from the relative safety of the flames, forcing their foe to either fight in an unfavorable environment or flee via a narrow escape route. To defend against such a powerful move, one must first recognize its inception. A sudden change in stance, a redirection of focus, or a subtle shift in weight can signal an impending fiery prison. Should you find yourself trapped, stay calm and assess the situation. Look for an escape route, keep low to avoid smoke inhalation and intense heat, and use any means available to douse or repel the flames. Adaptability is key in these dire moments, as well as unwavering courage. Conclusion Battling the Chakram Warriors requires a blend of skill, vigilance, and adaptability. By understanding the nuances of their chakram attacks, detecting the signs of their sneak tactics, and devising strategies to survive their fiery manipulation of terrain, you will be better prepared to face these formidable opponents. Remember, knowledge is power, and in the art of combat, every ounce of power can tip the scales in your favor. Go forth and conquer, brave warrior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: On February 8, 1847, Doniphan continued his march with 924 men mostly from Missouri; he accompanied a train of 315 wagons of a large commercial caravan heading to the state capital. Meanwhile, the Mexican forces in the state had time to prepare a defense against the Americans. About 20 miles (32 km) north of the capital where two mountain ranges join from east to west is the only pass into the capital; known as Sacramento Pass, this point is now part of present-day Chihuahua City. The Battle of Sacramento was the most important battle fought in the state of Chihuahua because it was the sole defense for the state capital. The battle ended quickly because of some devastating defensive errors from the Mexican forces and the ingenious strategic moves by the American forces. After their loss at the Battle of Sacramento, the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated south, leaving the city to American occupation. Almost 300 Mexicans were killed in the battle, as well as almost 300 wounded. The Americans also confiscated large amounts of Mexican supplies and took 400 Mexican soldiers prisoners of war.

Researchers at the University of Toronto call it \\"reorienting one's priorities,\\" and report in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General that wiping our hands acts as a physical proxy for mentally separating ideas that are still kicking around in our heads. This allows us to refocus on a new goal. The researchers tested this by having participants focus on certain goals by taking a short survey or playing word games. Some participants were then asked to evaluate what they'd done, while others were asked to use a handwipe to clean their hands first. Sure enough, those who cleaned their hands were less likely to think of the goal they'd been primed to focus on and less likely to find it important, reports Entrepreneur.

Turns out, the key to mental clarity could be in a simple daily activity that is often overlooked: cleaning your hands. Research conducted at the University of Toronto sheds light on how handwashing can aid in reorienting one's priorities and refocusing on a new goal. Body The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, reveals that wiping our hands after a task acts as a physical proxy for mentally separating ideas lingering in our minds. This helps us refocus and concentrate on a new objective. The researchers tested their hypothesis by having participants engage in short surveys or word games to direct their focus towards specific goals. After completing these tasks, some participants were asked to evaluate their progress, while others used a handwipe to clean their hands before reflecting on the task. As reported by Entrepreneur, the results indicated that those who cleaned their hands were less likely to dwell on the previously set goals and found them less important. However, this effect is not always positive. The research also highlighted that for people who were primed with a health goal, using a handwipe reduced their likelihood of making healthy choices afterward. They were more inclined to choose a chocolate bar instead of a granola bar, for instance. Despite this occasional negative consequence, United Press International (UPI) emphasized that the overall effect of handwashing aids in making individuals more receptive to new ways of thinking. As a result, when a mental reset is needed, this simple act can be an effective option to try. Additionally, it is essential to emphasize that the duration spent washing our hands plays a more crucial role in removing bacteria than water temperature. Conclusion In conclusion, handwashing is a simple, daily activity that offers significant benefits, not only in terms of personal hygiene but also in facilitating mental clarity and refocusing attention on new priorities. So, the next time you look for a way to declutter your thoughts and switch gears, washing your hands might just be the perfect solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A young married couple who plotted to abuse children as part of a paedophile love triangle are facing jail after police uncovered 'horrific' texts and indecent images of children and animals. Kevin Barnett, 28, suggested drugging youngsters so he could enact his sick desires and his wife Susan, 28, said she would be willing to comfort a child as it was raped, a court heard. The pair were found guilty of arranging the commission of a child sexual offence and a second woman, Nikita Moore, 22, was convicted of conspiracy to commit child sexual offences with Barnett. Moore had even discussed having a baby with Barnett, from Barrow, Cumbria, for them to abuse together - although prosecutors conceded this particular 'horrific' exchange was just fantasy. Kevin Barnett, 28, (right) suggested drugging children so he could enact his sick desires and his wife Susan, 28, (left) said she would be willing to comfort a child as it was raped, a court heard. The 22-year-old was sending messages to Barnett saying she thought about sexually abusing children 'all the time' when sick exchanges between the married couple were still continuing. Although both women were eager to please Barnett as he made increasingly disturbing suggestions, the Preston Crown Court heard he was the driving force behind the criminal activity. Mr Brown told the court how Barnett took advantage of the women's feelings and exploited their desperation for his own sexual gratification - at one stage having a threesome with both women. Detectives were able to stop the would-be child abusers after officers were called to a domestic disturbance between, Barnett and a woman unrelated to the case. Officers examined his phone after a tip off and the three defendants were arrested after detectives trawled through the sick messages. Nikita Moore, 22, discussed having a baby with Barnett for them to abuse together and they have been convicted of conspiracy to commit child sexual offences. All three denied the charges and argued the texts had been a 'fantasy' with no real intent to act on them. The jury had to decide whether or not the messages represented a genuine plan to sexually abuse children. Moore began an affair with Barnett shortly after the death of her long term partner Jason Baines, who killed himself in October 2013. The 22-year-old, originally from Birmingham, said the two had indulged in 'unconventional' sexual practices. Their relationship ended in early 2014 when Moore discovered Barnett was also having an affair with another woman. After admitting the affair to Mrs Barnett, Moore said the two women had become 'really close' and began living together in Barrow. But Moore continued to secretly exchange messages with Kevin Barnett discussing underage sex and sharing indecent images of children. Summing up the case, Judge Christopher Cornwell told the jury: 'You have heard the text exchange which at times no doubt disgusted you. We could go on and on with the disgust but the central question never goes away. Was there a conclusive agreement and was there an agreement that it should be put into action?' Moore and Kevin Barnett had previously pleaded guilty to offences relating to indecent images of children. Mrs Barnett had also pleaded guilty to possessing extreme pornography depicting sex with animals. The defendants will next appear at Preston Crown Court for sentencing for all the offences on February 5 next year. Judge Cornwall said: 'I don't see any alternative to immediate imprisonment.' Acting Detective Inspector Brian Murray, of the South Cumbria Public Protection Unit, said: 'I am pleased that justice has been served today and these three individuals will be facing prison for their crimes. 'Thankfully cases like this are extremely rare in Cumbria and the quick arrests of these three people once information came to light show that we are committed to protecting children in Cumbria.'

Invisible Children's video, 'Kony 2012', directed by filmmaker Jason Russell, racked up 50 million YouTube hits in four days after receiving huge support on Twitter and from A-list celebrities. Now following on from the group's 20-minute Kony documentary last month which swept the world, Invisible Children have released a follow-up YouTube video. The follow-up, 'Kony 2012: Beyond Famous', addresses criticism aimed at the original video, but does not feature director Russell, following his naked rant 'meltdown' in San Diego after the video achieved worldwide fame.

Write an article based on this summary: Women prepared to sacrifice family life can do as well as male colleagues in financial firms, if not better, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said.","completion":"Title: Striving for Success: Women in Finance According to UKIP Leader Nigel Farage Introduction: The traditionally male-dominated world of finance has seen a change in recent years, with more and more women breaking through the glass ceiling and achieving success. Women have started to play a significant role in the financial industry, proving themselves equally capable and competent as men in this competitive sphere. This transformation has been the subject of various debates and discussion; the latest addition being UKIP leader Nigel Farage's recent statement. Thesis Statement: Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), believes that women can achieve the same level of success as their male counterparts in financial firms, as long as they are prepared to sacrifice their family life. Body: 1. Farage's Statement: a. Farage's viewpoint highlights the potential for women to excel in the finance industry, even surpassing their male colleagues. b. His statement also showcases the evident inequality in the industry, as women may need to put their personal lives on the line in order to achieve success. 2. Women in Finance Today: a. Women now hold a growing number of high-level positions, indicating a shift away from the traditional notion that the industry is exclusive to men. b. Research has shown that gender diversity in finance leads to better problem-solving, decision-making, and overall performance. 3. Challenges Faced by Women in Finance: a. Despite Farage's assertion, women still encounter gender bias, unequal pay, and a lack of mentorship in the industry. b. Balancing family life proves to be a significant struggle, with women often choosing between career progression and personal commitments. 4. Potential Solutions to Create Equality: a. Implementing flexible working hours to accommodate the needs of working parents. b. Offering paid parental leave policies that benefit both genders. c. Encouraging mentorship and networking opportunities for women to develop their careers. Conclusion: The finance industry has started to recognize the value and potential of women, with Farage's statement being a testament to their growing presence and success. Although his comment highlights the apparent inequality in balancing personal life with professional pursuit, there lies a necessity for structural reforms and policy implementation to ensure that women can reach the same heights as their male counterparts without sacrificing their family life. By fostering a more inclusive environment, the finance industry can benefit from diverse perspectives and improved performance brought about by the contributions of motivated, talented, and determined women."},{"prompt":"Information: - The genus Allonautilus contains two species of nautiluses, which have a significantly different morphology from those placed in the sister taxon \\"Nautilus\\". \\"Allonautilus\\" is now thought to be a descendant of \\"Nautilus\\" and the latter paraphyletic. - The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, Mya. As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a major Ordovician-Silurian extinction event when 60% of marine species were wiped out. - The molluscs (or mollusks ) compose the large phylum of invertebrate animals known as the Mollusca. Around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. Molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebratesand either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. The scientific study of molluscs is called malacology. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Malacology is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, octopus and squid, and numerous other kinds, many (but by no means all) of which have shells. One division of malacology, conchology, is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from Greek , \\"malakos\\", \\"soft\\"; and , \\"-logia\\". - Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs. - The octopus (or ; plural: octopuses, octopodes or octopi; see below) is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. It has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. It has no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing it to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates. - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian. - The giant squid (genus Architeuthis) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size due to deep-sea gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum size at for females and for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at an estimated , one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles (but including head and arms) rarely exceeds . Claims of specimens measuring or more have not been scientifically documented. - Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\". - The colossal squid (\\"Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni\\", from Greek \\"mesos\\" (middle), \\"onycho\\" (claw, nail), and \\"teuthis\\" (squid)), sometimes called the Antarctic or giant cranch squid, is believed to be the largest squid species in terms of mass. It is the only known member of the genus \\"Mesonychoteuthis\\". It is known from only a few specimens, and current estimates put its maximum size at long and weighing possibly up to 750 kg (1,650 lb), based on analysis of smaller and immature specimens, making it the largest known invertebrate. - Nautiloids are a large and diverse group of marine cephalopods ( Mollusca ) belonging to the subclass Nautiloidea that began in the Late Cambrian and are represented today by the living Nautilus and Allonautilus . Nautiloids flourished during the early Paleozoic era , where they constituted the main predatory animals , and developed an extraordinary diversity of shell shapes and forms . Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known , but only a handful of species survive to the present day . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Ordovician is a geologic period and system, the second of six periods of the Paleozoic Era. The Ordovician spans 41.2 million years from the end of the Cambrian Period million years ago (Mya) to the start of the Silurian Period Mya. The Ordovician, named after the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879 to resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison, who were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and Silurian periods, respectively. Lapworth, recognized that the fossil fauna in the disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the Silurian periods, and placed them in a period of their own. It received international sanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era by the International Geological Congress. - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - The Paleozoic (or Palaeozoic) Era (from the Greek \\"palaios\\" (), \\"old\\" and \\"zoe\\" (), \\"life\\", meaning \\"ancient life\\") is the earliest of three geologic eras of the Phanerozoic, from . It is the longest of the Phanerozoic eras, and is subdivided into six geologic periods (from oldest to youngest): the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The Paleozoic comes after the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic and is followed by the Mesozoic. - The Nautilina is the last suborder of the Nautilida and the only nautiloids living since the end of the Triassic. The Nautilina, proposed by Shimanskiy, is basically the Nautilaceae of Kummel, 1964, defined by Furnish and Glenister, but differs in omitting two families, the Paracenoceratidae and Pseudonautilidae which instead are placed in the Liroceratina. - The Permian is a geologic period and system which spans 46.7 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic Period 252.2 Mya. It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era; the following Triassic Period belongs to the Mesozoic Era. The concept of the Permian was introduced in 1841 by geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who named it after the city of Perm. - The Proterozoic is a geological eon representing the time just before the proliferation of complex life on Earth. The name Proterozoic comes from Greek and means \\"earlier life\\", the Greek root protero-,means \\"former, earlier\\" and zoic-, means \\"animal, living being\\". The Proterozoic Eon extended from to (million years ago), and is the most recent part of the Precambrian Supereon. It is subdivided into three geologic eras (from oldest to youngest): the Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic. The well-identified events of this eon were the transition to an oxygenated atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic; several glaciations, which produced the hypothesized Snowball Earth during the Cryogenian Period in the late Neoproterozoic Era; and the Ediacaran Period (635 to 541 Ma) which is characterized by the evolution of abundant soft-bodied multicellular organisms and provides us with the first obvious fossil evidence of life on earth. - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina. - The Cambrian Period (or ) was the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, of the Phanerozoic Eon. The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period mya. Its subdivisions, and its base, are somewhat in flux. The period was established (as Cambrian series) by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latinised form of \\"Cymru\\", the Welsh name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed. The Cambrian is unique in its unusually high proportion of lagerstätte sedimentary deposits, sites of exceptional preservation where \\"soft\\" parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells. As a result, our understanding of the Cambrian biology surpasses that of some later periods. - The Devonian is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic, spanning 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, Mya. It is named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period were first studied. The first significant adaptive radiation of life on dry land occurred during the Devonian. Free-sporing vascular plants began to spread across dry land, forming extensive forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants appeared. Various terrestrial arthropods also became well-established. Fish reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to often be dubbed the \\"Age of Fish\\". The first ray-finned and lobe-finned bony fish appeared, while the placodermi began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology. - The Nautilaceae form one of five superfamilies that make up the Nautilida according to Bernard Kummel (1964), and the only one that survived past the Triassic. The Nautilaceae comprise six families: Nautilidae, Paracenoceratidae, Pseudonautilidae, Cymatoceratidae, Hercoglossidae, and Aturiidae. Shimanskiy (1957) separated the Paracenoceratidae and Pseudonautilidae from his near equivalent Nautilina and added them to the Lyroceratina, expanding the equivalent Clydonautilaceae and bringing it into the Jurassic. The Nautilaceae are represented by \\"Nautilus\\" and \\"Allonautilus\\", genera included in the Nautilidae. - Slug, or land slug, is a common name for any apparently shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word \\"slug\\" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name \\"snail\\", which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal can fully retract its soft parts into the shell). What is the relationship between 'nautiloid' and 'cephalopoda'? A:","completion":"Nautiloids are a subclass within the class Cephalopoda. Cephalopoda is a class of molluscs that includes marine animals like nautiloids, squid, octopuses, and cuttlefish. Nautiloids are a specific group of marine cephalopods characterized by their external shell and tentacle-like structures. So, nautiloids are a type of cephalopod."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write a summary based on this article: If the Charlottesville rally came as a shock, with hundreds of white Americans marching in support of ideologies many have long considered too vile, dangerous or stupid to enter the political mainstream, it obscured the fact that some in the small, loosely defined alt-right movement are hoping to make those ideas seem less than shocking for the “normies,” or normal people, that its sympathizers have tended to mock online. And to go from mocking to wooing, the movement will be looking to make use of people like the Hovaters and their trappings of normie life — their fondness for National Public Radio, their four cats, their bridal registry. “We need to have more families. We need to be able to just be normal,” said Matthew Heimbach, the leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, in a podcast conversation with Mr. Hovater. Why, he asked self-mockingly, were so many followers “abnormal”? Mr. Hovater replied: “I mean honestly, it takes people with, like, sort of an odd view of life, at first, to come this way. Because most people are pacified really easy, you know. Like, here’s some money, here’s a nice TV, go watch your sports, you know?” He added: “The fact that we’re seeing more and more normal people come is because things have gotten so bad. And if they keep getting worse, we’ll keep getting more, just, normal people.” Flattening the Edges Mr. Hovater’s face is narrow and punctuated with sharply peaked eyebrows, like a pair of air quotes, and he tends to deliver his favorite adjective, “edgy,” with a flat affect and maximum sarcastic intent. It is a sort of implicit running assertion that the edges of acceptable American political discourse — edges set by previous generations, like the one that fought the Nazis — are laughable. “I don’t want you to think I’m some ‘edgy’ Republican,” he says, while flatly denouncing the concept of democracy. ||||| A Nazi sympathizer who was profiled recently in The New York Times and his wife and brother-in-law have lost their jobs, after the article prompted an outpouring of hostility to the restaurant that employed them, both he and the restaurant said. The Times article depicted Tony Hovater, 29, as an otherwise unremarkable person who voices “casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate.” He is active in a group called the Traditionalist Workers Party; organizations that track extremist groups have called it a hate group, allied with neo-Nazis, and call its views white supremacist, a label it rejects. Mr. Hovater, his wife, Maria, and her brother had worked at 571 Grill and Draft House, near their home in New Carlisle, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. Mr. Hovater worked at the restaurant as a part-time cook for a little over a year, according to a manager there. Though the Times article did not mention the restaurant — Mr. Hovater had identified himself as a welder by trade — people appalled by his views learned that he worked there and began calling and leaving online messages. ||||| This is a public statement being made by the owners of 571 Grill & Draft House regarding a recent New York Times article that featured the controversial political views of one of their employees. While the 571 Grill and Draft House is happy to be recognized by national news outlets for our 571 Haystack burger, it’s with a sad heart that we must reflect on a divisive political topic that has unfortunately darkened the doorstep of our small business. A November 25th New York Times article featured one of our employees. In the article, the employee shared his political views, specifically those of being a white nationalist. The article went on, illustrating some very disturbing images and thoughts from this individual. The 571 Grill and Draft House does not share any of these views with this person, nor was the owner aware of them prior to the publishing of this article. Since the release of this article, we have been swamped with phone calls and social media messages that are threatening and intimidating to both us and our employees. These hateful and disturbing messages are truly saddening to those of us who just want to serve delicious food and cold beers. Due to these very disturbing threats, the employee who was featured in the article suggested that we release him from employment. We have done so and have also released his wife and her brother who also worked for us. We felt it necessary to fully sever the relationship with them in hopes to protect our 20 other employees from the verbal and social media threats being made from individuals all over the country, and as far as Australia. We neither encourage nor support any forms of hate within our establishment. We have been in business for a very long time and have a great reputation for supporting our community, and want to continue to do so. We do not check political party affiliation of any of our patrons and as such we are prayerful that members of our community understand that this has been a very difficult situation for us.

Options are: [A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no;","completion":"Answer: [C]. no; Explanation: The premise states that significant cost savings can be achieved for power generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative package, which means that some form of legislating can lead to cost savings. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that big cost savings can never be obtained through legislating, which contradicts the premise.

Here's the equation: -464*p - 69*p = 26*p - 35092 - 12982 First, let's deal with the left side: -464*p - 69*p. To simplify this, we just need to add the \\"p\\" parts together: -464 + (-69) = -533 So the left side simplifies to: -533*p Now let's simplify the right side, which is: 26*p - 35092 - 12982. We need to combine the numbers together: -35092 + (-12982) = -48074 So the right side simplifies to: 26*p - 48074 Now our equation looks like this: -533*p = 26*p - 48074 Next, we want to get all the \\"p\\" on one side of the equation, and all the numbers on the other side.

Convicted in 1945 of capital murder by an all-white, male jury, Baker was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by the electric chair. Baker had claimed self-defense in the fatal shooting of her employer, Ernest Knight, during a struggle. He was an abusive drunk who had forced the 44-year-old woman into a sexual relationship and sometimes held her at his place against her will. She was posthumously pardoned in 2005. The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"The movie plot focuses on the tumultuous life of Lena Baker, an African-American woman living in a period marked by racial and gender bias. Born to a sharecropper family, Lena's plight takes a nosedive when she is wrongfully convicted of capital murder in 1945 by an all-white, male jury. Predominantly, it's her execution that stands out as she becomes the only woman in Georgia to meet her death by the electric chair. However, the narrative provides a backdrop of an abusive relationship marked by forced sex and confinement, with her employer, Ernest Knight. Subsequently, her posthumous pardon in 2005 raises pertinent questions about the justice system and societal prejudices of the time. Based on the plot, the movie delves deep into early 20th century American society, exploring themes of racial bias, sexual abuse, injustice, and redemption. Lena Baker's story, as scripted in this movie plot, is a stirring account of human strength and the quest for justice and dignity. Considering this, a comprehensive question about the movie plot could be: 'How does the film depict the life of Lena Baker, her struggles with racial and gender bias, her forced relationship and eventual death in the context of societal prejudices and the justice system of the mid-20th century Georgia? Further, what significance does her posthumous pardon in 2005 represent in terms of historical reconciliation and acknowledgment of past injustices?' This question demands a detailed analysis of Lena Baker's life, the societal factors influencing her fate, as well as the larger implications of her vindication years after her death.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A fixture of New Jersey Republican politics and her husband have been found dead in their home in an apparent murder-suicide. Police have not publicly identified the couple who were found Thursday morning, but the Arden Road home belonged to retired Morris County clerk Joan Bramhall and her husband John Bramhall. The Star Ledger reports that sources close to the investigation have confirmed the couples' identities. Recently retired: New Jersey Republican fixture Joan Bramhall is believed to have been found dead along with her husband John Bramhall in their home. Joan Bramhall, 75, had been a fixture in. local Republican politics and retired in December 2013 after serving as. county clerk for 15 years. The couple had four children together but lost one, and also raised four of their grandchildren. Police were dispatched to the property after a relative reported a person found deceased in the home at 10am Thursday. Officers then found a second body in the house. According to the Daily Record, one daughter-in-law of the couple was staying at the home but was not present at the time of the deaths. Police released a statement saying that a male and female in their seventies had been found dead in the home. They said the investigation is in its preliminary stages but that 'there is no indication...that there is any threat to the community.' No further details were given. Joan Bramhall had been a longtime member of the Morris County Republican Committee and served as its chairwoman from 1988 to 1994, and worked alongside present Governor Chris Christie as a freeholder from 1993 to 1998. John Bramhall had owned a construction company which was responsible for many of the large homes in the couple's neighborhood, reports the Star Ledger. 'It's a damn tragedy. God, she just retired. She had done so much - county clerk, chairwoman of the Republican Party, a great supporter of me as I was of her,' Senator Anthony Bucco told the Daily Record, adding that he'd just seen Bramhall a month ago. Family home: The couple were found in their Arden Road home after police received a call from a family member. He said she'd told him that she and her husband had travel plans for their retirement and that she'd hoped to go to Alaska. Other friends and former colleagues were equally shocked and distraught. Assembleyman Michael Patrick Carroll said Bramhall was incredibly kind and helpful to him when he began in politics in the 1970s. 'She was a great lady, everybody's friend. She never had an ill word about anybody,' Carroll told the Star Ledger. 'At the end of the day, if you could stay serving the people in the state of New Jersey for basically 50 years, even somewhere as relatively civil as Morris County, and never piss anyone off, that says a lot about your personality.' When she announced at the age of 74 in January 2013 that she would not run for a fourth term as county clerk, Bramhall said she was looking forward to her retirement. 'You know when it's time to stop and I want to stop and smell the roses, so to speak,' Bramhall said, reports the Daily Record. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta? Options: A. Any time - it'll have better structure B. not enough information C.

Context: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.

Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I’ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I’ve never returned to THAT one. Who cut everyone's hair in the family as Jennifer grew up?

Anatomy of an op-ed gone horribly, horribly wrong Over the past few months and years, the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has tried to make a few useful suggestions for improving the quality of punditry during this campaign season. For example: To be fair, I never actually wrote that last point up, mostly because I thought it was so obvious that it did not need to be said out loud. I bring this up because Politico co-founder Jim VandeHei’s Wall Street Journal op-ed manages to ignore all of these warnings. Praising the plain language of Donald Trump? Check. References to disruption? Check. Calls for an “Innovation Party?” Check. VandeHei also leans hard on the “Normal America vs. D.C. bubble” trope, which will be a topic for another column. Today, however, Spoiler Alerts would like to focus on VandeHei’s yearning for a military leader to set things right: Exploit the fear factor. The candidate should be from the military or immediately announce someone with modern-warfare expertise or experience as running mate. People are scared. Terrorism is today’s World War and Americans want a theory for dealing with it. President Obama has established an intriguing precedent of using drone technology and intelligence to assassinate terrorists before they strike. A third-party candidate could build on death-by-drones by outlying the type of modern weapons, troops and war powers needed to keep America safe. And make plain when he or she will use said power. Do it with very muscular language — there is no market for nuance in the terror debate. There are many, many things wrong with that paragraph. But ignore the “scare Americans and use force at will” rhetoric for a few paragraphs. Do you know who would fit VandeHei’s bill perfectly? Retired four-star admiral William McRaven. Former Navy SEAL. Former JSOC commander. Current chancellor of the University of Texas system. Architect of the Osama bin Laden raid. Even better, it seems as though McRaven is ready to enter the political fray. Except that, as my Washington Post colleague Craig Whitlock notes, McRaven’s latest political intervention is … somewhat problematic: [McRaven] made clear that he was angry at the Senate for its treatment of Rear Adm. Brian L. Losey, the commander in charge of the Navy’s elite SEAL teams and other commando units. Losey, who formerly served under McRaven, was denied promotion last month and is being forced to retire after several senators from both parties pressured the Navy to hold him accountable for retaliating against multiple whistleblowers. … McRaven’s description of Losey as an innocent victim is at odds with the findings of the Defense Department’s inspector general, which concluded that he had repeatedly violated whistleblower-protection laws. … Had he stopped there, McRaven’s comments probably would not have attracted much public attention. Instead, he went on to slam lawmakers and question whether a fundamental underpinning of the American system of government — civilian control of the military — was frayed or at risk. “The greater concern for America is the continued attack on leadership in the military,” he wrote. “During my past several years in uniform, I watched in disbelief how lawmakers treated the chairman, the service chiefs, the combatant commanders and other senior officers during Congressional testimony. These officers were men of incredible integrity, and yet some lawmakers showed no respect for their decades of service.” So the poster boy for VandeHei’s new leadership is … a recently retired admiral who challenges civilian control of the military. I would be uncomfortable with this person in charge of determining the proper allocation of war powers between the different branches of government. By exploiting the fear factor. Enough with the op-eds that search for magical solutions to existing problems. Can we see some op-eds that address how to restore trust in Congress? Because that is the underlying problem that enables McRaven or VandeHei to go on these rants.

He criticized Democratic and Republican candidates for catering to the fringes of their parties.

The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"Why was the Algarve considered a legitimate target when it was attacked by Francis Drake?\\" Answer: \\"Because Sagres did not have to be sacked\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choose your answer from: [a]. no.

The first night of the season at the London Opera House finds the opening of a new opera by Lord Ambrose D'Arcy (Michael Gough), a wealthy and pompous man, who is annoyed and scornful when the opera manager Lattimer (Thorley Walters) informs him the theatre has not been completely sold out. No one will sit in a certain box because it is haunted. Backstage, despite the soothing efforts of the opera's producer, Harry Hunter (Edward de Souza), everyone, including the show's star, Maria, is nervous and upset as if a sinister force was at work. The climax comes during Maria's first aria, when a side of the scenery rips apart to reveal the body of a hanged stage hand. In a panic, the curtain is rung down, and Maria refuses to sing again. With the show postponed, Harry frantically auditions new singers. He finds a promising young star in Christine Charles (Heather Sears), one of the chorus girls. Lord Ambrose lecherously approves of the selection, and invites Christine to dinner. In her dressing room after the audition, Christine is warned against Lord Ambrose by a Phantom voice. At dinner, Lord Ambrose attempts to seduce her, but as they are about to leave to his apartment, she is saved by Harry. On the ride back home, Christine tells Harry about the voice she heard. Intrigued, Harry takes Christine back to the opera house, where in her dressing room, a voice tells Harry to leave her there and go. At the same time the rat catcher (Patrick Troughton) is murdered by the Phantom's lackey, a dwarf (Ian Wilson).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich? from the following article ? As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him bewailing their loss.

Sentence 1: I fear it does not help us much, said the Coroner, with a sigh. Sentence 2: The coroner was happy to have so much help. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To reconcile the differences between the two sentences and determine if the second sentence is true when considering the first sentence as true, we must first analyze their contents and context. Sentence 1: \\"I fear it does not help us much, said the Coroner, with a sigh.\\" In the first sentence, the Coroner expresses concern or doubt about the helpfulness of something, and their emotion is identified by the sigh, indicating potential frustration or disappointment. The subject matter, which the Coroner believes to be unhelpful, is not explicitly mentioned. Sentence 2: \\"The coroner was happy to have so much help.\\" The second sentence presents a contrasting emotion and situation where the Coroner is described as feeling happy due to the amount of help they are receiving. The two sentences pose differing scenarios, with the first sentence featuring a concerned or disappointed tone, while the second sentence describes a more positive scenario where the Coroner is happy. However, if we integrate these sentences into a broader context, it is possible that the second sentence still holds true while retaining the truth of the first sentence. For instance, in a complex investigation, multiple sources of information could contribute to varying levels of usefulness in solving the case. The Coroner may be appreciative of the help they are receiving, as described in the second sentence. However, a specific piece of evidence or information, as hinted at in the first sentence, might not be as helpful as the Coroner initially hoped. The Coroner's concerns pertain to the quality of assistance or the information being provided, but this doesn't negate their appreciation for the help they are receiving. Thus, in conclusion, it is possible to reconcile and interpret both sentences as true when understanding the broader context and complexities of the situation. The Coroner might be happy to receive help (true to the second sentence), but they express doubt or disappointment about a particular finding, aspect, or piece of information, as shown in the first sentence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her mother, Evelyn Welch (nee Evelyn Kathleen Samuels), is an American emigrant from New York City who was educated at Harvard University and the Warburg Institute, University of London. Evelyn is currently Professor of Renaissance Studies and Vice-Principal for Arts and Sciences at King's College London. Context: According to Welch, the band name \\"Florence + the Machine\\" had \\"started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine, to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad\\". In 2006, Welch's performances with Isabella Summers in small London venues under the joint name Florence Robot/Isa Machine began to attract notice. In 2007, Welch recorded with a band named Ashok, who released an album titled Plans on the Filthy Lucre/About Records label. This album included the earliest version of her later hit \\"Kiss with a Fist\\", which at this point was titled \\"Happy Slap\\". Florence and the Machine released their debut album Lungs in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2009. The album was officially launched with a set at the Rivoli Ballroom in Brockley, South East London. It peaked at number one in the UK and number two in Ireland. As of 6 August 2009, the album had sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and by 10 August it had been at number two for five consecutive weeks. Following its 25 July 2009 release for download in the United States, the album debuted at number seventeen on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, ultimately peaking at number one. The album was released physically in the US on 20 October by Universal Republic. The album was produced by James Ford, Paul Epworth, Steve Mackey and Charlie Hugall. Welch contributed vocals to David Byrne and Fatboy Slim's 2010 album Here Lies Love, an album about Imelda Marcos. As of January 2011, Welch was working with Drake on material slated for his upcoming album. On 27 February 2011, Welch replaced pregnant Dido and sang her portion of Best Original Song nominee \\"If I Rise\\" (from 127 Hours) with A. R. Rahman at the 83rd Academy Awards. Question: What was the joke Answer:","completion":"The joke was that Florence and her friend, Isabella, gave themselves funny robot-like names while making music together. Florence was called \\"Florence Robot\\" and Isabella was called \\"Isabella Machine.\\" When Florence needed a name for her first gig, she combined the two names to create \\"Florence Robot/Isa Machine.\\" This eventually turned into the band name \\"Florence + the Machine,\\" which started as their private joke but became very popular."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"To determine whether \\"an unsociable person\\" is a valid answer to describe Alex, I will analyze the information given and consider alternative explanations. Step 1: Analyze the information - Alex went home to be by themselves after nobody wanted to play with them. Step 2: Define \\"unsociable\\" - Unsociable: Not wanting to be with others or not enjoying the company of others. This implies that the person consistently avoids socializing with others. Step 3: Consider alternative explanations - It's possible that Alex had a one-time experience of not finding anyone to play with and chose to be alone. - Alex could be shy or introverted, which might make it difficult for them to approach others to play but doesn't mean they are unsociable. - Alex might have other reasons for going home, such as needing to attend to personal matters or not feeling well. Step 4: Evaluate the validity of the answer - Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex is an unsociable person. The single instance mentioned doesn't necessarily indicate a consistent pattern of being unsociable.

Options are: a). description. b). entity. c). abbreviation. d). human. e). numeric. f). location. A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What are the largest deserts in the world?\\" would be an entity option because deserts are specific geographical features. The world has several large deserts, each varying in size, climate, and geological characteristics. Here is a more detailed and long response to provide an understanding of the largest deserts globally and their individual qualities. 1. Antarctic Desert: The largest desert in the world is the Antarctic Desert, covering approximately 5.5 million square miles (14,062,000 square kilometers) on the continent of Antarctica. Despite its icy conditions, it receives very little precipitation (mainly in the form of snow), making it a cold polar desert. Due to its extreme climate, inhospitable conditions, and remote location, very few plant and animal species are found here. 2. Arctic Desert: The Arctic Desert is the second-largest desert, spanning 5.4 million square miles (13,989,000 square kilometers) over the Arctic region around the North Pole. It includes parts of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Like the Antarctic Desert, the Arctic Desert is also a cold polar desert characterized by very low precipitation, extreme cold, and a barren landscape with limited biodiversity. 3. Sahara Desert: The Sahara Desert, often just called the Sahara, is the third-largest desert in the world and the largest hot desert. The Sahara covers approximately 3.6 million square miles (9,200,000 square kilometers) in North Africa, extending across countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Sudan, Chad, and Tunisia. It features various landscapes, including sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and numerous mountain ranges, such as the Atlas and the Ahaggar. While harsh and unforgiving, the Sahara hosts a variety of plant and animal species that have adapted to the desert's extreme conditions. 4. Arabian Desert: The fourth-largest desert in the world is the Arabian Desert, covering roughly 900,000 square miles (2,330,000 square kilometers) on the Arabian Peninsula. It spans across several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and parts of Jordan and Iraq. This desert is characterized by sand dunes, dry riverbeds called wadis, and gravel plains. The Arabian Desert is home to a unique variety of plant and animal species, such as the Arabian oryx and the Arabian camel. 5. Gobi Desert: The Gobi Desert is the fifth-largest desert, covering approximately 500,000 square miles (1,295,000 square kilometers) in Central Asia. It stretches across vast portions of Mongolia and parts of China. Unlike many other large deserts, the Gobi Desert is a cold desert that experiences extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night and also between the seasons. The Gobi is known for its diverse landscapes, including sand dunes, mountains, and grasslands. It is home to unique and endangered species such as the Gobi bear, wild Bactrian camel, and snow leopard. In conclusion, when discussing the largest deserts in the world, it is essential to consider both cold polar deserts and hot arid deserts. The answer to your question belongs to the entity category because it refers to specific, identifiable geographical regions. Each of these deserts is unique and significant in their own way, and all of them play important roles in influencing global climate, geography, and biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year. and a hint : When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. Please answer this question : Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. The hint provided explains that when waves travel into shallow water areas, the ocean bottom starts to affect the wave's behavior. As the water becomes shallower, the waves become higher, steeper, and ultimately develop a sharp-crested wave shape, which becomes a wave of translation. This causes more intense erosion on the ocean bottom. Since the South gulf has shallow water and is wider, it is more likely to experience these conditions – higher, steeper waves affected by the ocean bottom – resulting in more erosion on the ocean bottom. On the other hand, the North gulf is deep, meaning the waves do not interact with the ocean bottom in the same manner, leading to less erosion in comparison to the South gulf."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: NEW YORK — Federal prosecutors have launched an inquiry into aggressive sales tactics at Wells Fargo after revelations that thousands of its employees secretly created accounts customers didn’t ask for to meet sales goals, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation, which is being conducted by the U.S. attorney’s office in New York, is preliminary and may not produce charges, said one person familiar with the matter. That person said that the banking giant had been served with subpoenas, but that the prosecutors have not decided whether the case warrants criminal or civil charges. The investigation escalate an already embarrassing episode for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. Regulators fined the bank 185 million last week for a scheme in which employees created up to 2 million accounts, for services such as credit cards and savings accounts, that customers did not authorize. In some cases, the employees took money from an established account to create a new one. Some customers were then hit with assorted fees for accounts they didn’t know they had, the regulators charged. The activity peaked in 2013 and mostly occurred in the Southwest part of the country, company officials have said. “How probable is it that you would have a firm-wide, multiyear scheme involving thousands and thousands of people that senior leaders weren’t aware of?” said Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow and a former Justice Department trial lawyer. “I think the smart money is that some senior leaders were aware, and it is for that reason that prosecutors are apparently making an inquiry,” he said. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 workers for improper sales push. The executive in charge is retiring with 125 million. Wells Fargo has apologized to customers and said it would end the aggressive sales goals critics say pushed employees to break the rules. The company said last week it had dismissed 5,300 employees over five years for creating the unauthorized accounts, including some managers. “On average 1 percent [of employees] have not done the right thing, and we terminated them. I don’t want them here if they don’t represent the culture of the company,” John Stumpf, the company’s longtime chief executive, said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post. Wells Fargo CEO pledges to stamp out bad behavior. ‘I feel accountable.’ Stumpf is expected to testify before the Senate Banking Committee next week on the affair. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined Wells Fargo 185 million in penalties for allegedly creating 2 million bank and credit card accounts for customers without their knowledge. (Reuters) Wells Fargo has long cultivated a reputation for staying out of the regulatory headaches that have dogged some of its biggest competitors. That reputation is now at risk as lawmakers, regulators and even Wall Street analysts question how one of the country’s largest banks could have allowed such behavior to fester for years. The federal investigation also comes a year after the Justice Department said it would more aggressively pursue cases against individual company executives, not just corporations. For years, prosecutors endured criticism for not doing enough to prosecute high-level executives for financial misconduct, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Wells Fargo case, legal experts say, is an opportunity for federal officials to reflect that new focus. Wells Fargo declined to comment, and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York could not be reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the existence of an investigation, said the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, where Wells Fargo is based, is also investigating the matter. A spokesman for that office declined to comment. To build a case against a company executive, prosecutors would have to show “they knew there was a plan to create false accounts to drive up sales,” said Brandon L. Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Even if it appears that the executive purposefully attempted to avoid knowing about the fraud, prosecutors may be able to build a case, Garrett said. “They don’t have to participate if there is willful negligence,” he said. Wells Fargo has been the country’s largest bank by market value for years, but lost that perch to JPMorgan Chase this week as its stock price plummeted. It has fallen about 8 percent since regulators announced the 185 million fine.

Answer the following question: What is the name of the town were people moved after Elcor's land prices skyrocketed? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the...

Movie title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Szekely (born September 12, 1967), better known by his stage name Louis C.K. (), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. Context: C.K. was born Louis A. Szekely in Washington, D.C. on September 12, 1967, the son of software engineer Mary Louise (nee Davis) and economist Luis Szekely. His parents met at Harvard University, where his mother was completing her degree in a summer school program. They were married at St. Francis Church in Traverse City, Michigan. C.K. has three sisters. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Geza Szekely Schweiger, was a Hungarian Jewish surgeon whose family moved to Mexico, where he met C.K.'s Mexican paternal grandmother, Rosario Sanchez Morales. C.K.'s mother, an American with Irish ancestry, grew up on a farm in Michigan. She graduated from Owosso High School in Owosso, Michigan. She attended University of Michigan and graduated from Ohio State University Phi Beta Kappa. C.K.'s maternal grandparents were M. Louise Davis and Alfred C. Davis. When C.K. was a year old, his family moved to his father's home country of Mexico, where his father had earned a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico prior to graduating from Harvard. C.K.'s first language was Spanish; it was not until after they moved back to the U.S. when he was seven that he began to learn English. He has said that he has since forgotten much of his Spanish. When C.K. left Mexico with his family, they moved back to the United States and settled in Boston. Upon moving from Mexico to suburban Boston, C.K. wanted to become a writer and comedian, citing Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, and George Carlin as some of his influences. When he was 10, his parents divorced. C.K. said that his father was around but he did not see him much and when he remarried, C.K.'s father converted to Orthodox Judaism, the faith of his new wife. C.K. and his three sisters were raised by their single mother in Newton, Massachusetts. The fact that his mother had only \\"bad\\" TV shows to view upon returning home from work inspired him to work on television. C.K.'s mother raised her children as Catholic and they attended after-school Catholic class until they completed communion. C.K. has said that his father's whole family still lives in Mexico. C.K.'s paternal uncle Dr. Francisco Szekely is an academic and an international consultant on environmental affairs who served as Mexico's Deputy Minister of Environment (2000-2003). C.K. attended Newton North High School, and graduated in 1985. He graduated with future Friends star Matt LeBlanc. After graduation, C.K. worked as an auto mechanic and at a public access TV cable station in Boston. According to C.K., working in public access TV gave him the tools and technical knowledge to make his short films and later his television shows. \\"Learning is my favorite thing\\", he said. He also worked for a time as a cook and in a video store. Question: Did C.K. get the chance to become a writer?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, C.K. did get the chance to become a writer. He has worked as a writer for various projects, including The Chris Rock Show, his own television show \\"Louie,\\" and his stand-up comedy specials.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer. The solution, says Herman Daly, a former World Bank economist and eco-guru, is a \\"steady-state\\" economy, where the use of... The comparison between GDP and GPI data in 1978 has warned us that . A) GDP is crude measure that is not worth using B) car accident should by all means include in GDP C) we are gaining material wealth by destroying nature D) resources and energy will one day be totally used up The answer to this question is:","completion":"C) we are gaining material wealth by destroying nature. Ecological economists argue that the continued growth of GDP does not necessarily equate to genuine progress, as it does not take into account the costs associated with environmental degradation, pollution, and other negative externalities. They propose alternatives like the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), which factor in such costs, thereby providing a more holistic view of economic growth and well-being. The fact that global GPI per person peaked in 1978 suggests that our dependence on finite natural resources and our negative impact on the environment has been hindering true progress and making us poorer in the long run. As a result, ecological economists advocate for a shift towards a \\"steady-state\\" economy, where the use of resources is sustainable and balanced, ensuring long-term prosperity and environmental preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Note that the answer is present within the text. Question: How is this different from what it written? The answer is:","completion":"The passage discusses the papal bull Ineffabilis Deus, which strongly emphasizes the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15, referring to Mary as a woman eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and ultimately triumphing over him. There are several biblical symbols and metaphors presented within the text that the Church Fathers saw as foreshadowing Mary's divine gifts and original innocence. These symbols and their respective meanings include: 1. The ark of Noah: Symbolizes the divine protection and salvation of Mary and her role as a beacon of hope and safety amidst a world of sin. 2. The ladder in Jacob's vision: Represents the divine connection between heaven and earth and the essential role of Mary as an intercessor between God and humanity. 3. The burning bush witnessed by Moses: Stands for the purity and holiness of Mary being preserved even amidst the temptations and corruption surrounding her, remaining untouched and flourishing in her spiritual beauty. 4. The impregnable tower with a thousand bucklers: Depicts Mary as a steadfast and invulnerable defender of the faithful against the forces of evil. 5. The enclosed garden: Symbolizes Mary's spiritual purity and virginity, which remained intact and unblemished throughout her life. 6. The resplendent city of God on the holy mountains: Represents Mary as the foundation and model of the faithful community united in their devotion and worship of the divine. 7. The most august temple of God: Stands for the sacredness and sanctity of Mary as the dwelling place of the divine and the location where the Incarnation took place. As the question asks for how this is different from what is written, the answer is not explicitly different from the passage. The passage itself provides us with a detailed explanation of how the Church Fathers interpreted various biblical symbols in relation to Mary and her attributes, as well as the significance of Ineffabilis Deus in defining the dogma around her.

The planted seedlings weren't growing as quickly in the backyard like in the front yard because the","completion":"soil conditions, sunlight exposure, and watering patterns were significantly different between the two locations, which greatly influenced the overall growth and development of the plants. To begin with, the soil conditions in the backyard might have been less favorable for the growth of the seedlings as compared to the front yard. Factors that influence soil quality include its texture, drainage, nutrient availability, pH levels, and presence of beneficial organisms. For instance, if the backyard soil was predominantly clayey or compacted, this could restrict root growth and access to essential nutrients, while well-draining, loamy soil in the front yard would allow for healthier root development. Another crucial factor that plays a substantial role in plant growth is the availability of sunlight. Photosynthesis is the primary process by which plants capture light energy and convert it into glucose, the primary energy source for the plants. The backyard might have had a different sun exposure pattern than the front yard, due to factors such as the position of buildings, fences, and trees. These obstructions could cause the backyard to receive less sunlight, leading to slower growth of the seedlings as they struggle to produce enough energy for their needs. Watering patterns also have a huge impact on plant growth. Each plant species has its specific watering needs, depending on various factors such as climate, soil type, and sun exposure. If the backyard seedlings were watered inadequately, either too little or too much, it would have directly impacted their overall growth and health. In addition to that, inconsistent watering or irregularities in the irrigation system could create an imbalance of moisture in the soil, affecting both the roots' access to water and the optimal functioning of nutrients and soil organisms. Moreover, microclimate variations between the front yard and backyard can significantly affect plant growth. Factors such as wind patterns, temperature fluctuations, and humidity levels vary between different areas of a property, sometimes creating unique microclimates. These variations in the backyard could have impacted the seedlings' ability to grow quickly and efficiently. Lastly, several biotic factors, such as pests, diseases, and competition from existing plants, can further impact the growth of seedlings. For example, if the backyard was infested with pests or diseases, it could lead to slower growth or even loss of seedlings. Similarly, the presence of invasive or competing species in the backyard could have restricted the access of the planted seedlings to essential resources, thereby hindering their growth. In conclusion, the slower growth of seedlings in the backyard as compared to the front yard can be attributed to various abiotic and biotic factors, such as differences in soil conditions, sunlight exposure, watering patterns, microclimates, and presence of pests or diseases. To improve the growth rate of the seedlings in the backyard, it is essential to identify and address these limiting factors by amending the soil, implementing appropriate watering strategies, optimizing sunlight conditions, and managing pests and diseases, ultimately creating a more suitable environment for the seedlings to thrive."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

A student brought some in for his birthday this past week, and offered me and some of his other teachers one. I had the opportunity to try two flavors- a vanilla and a coconut-topped. Both cake flavors were off- way off. The batter was not mixed well and had chunks of un-fully-incorporated ingredients in it. It was the heaviest cupcake I have ever had, and tasted as if it had been baked two weeks ago and recently thawed (that was part of the \\"off\\" flavor to me). The frosting was one note: hella-sweet. I even overheard some kids complaining about it, and if that does not speak volumes, I don't know what would. The frosting was also exceedingly dense, and did not taste fresh. I normally love frosting and would never have complained about the copious amount on these cupcakes- if it had actually tasted even a little bit good.

Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. The appointment of Mr Staley is seen as answering investor criticism that the bank was losing its focus on investment banking. Mr Staley will be paid £1.2m in salary, £396,000 in pension contributions and as much as £5.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares. He will also receive £1.15m in shares per year that he will have to keep for five years before cashing in. That is a total of £8.2m for the year, if he is awarded the maximum bonus. He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about £1.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses. Analysts said this could include such areas as merger advice and trading in stocks. In common with Bob Diamond, the last investment banker to run Barclays, Mr Staley sees Africa as an important market for the bank. In his letter, he said: \\"Our business in Africa gives us exciting opportunities in fast growing economies. We will complete the necessary transformation and repositioning of the Investment Bank to a less capital intensive model. And we will support the growth of our world leading payments business in Barclaycard.\\" Announcing Mr Staley's appointment, Barclays chairman John McFarlane said: \\"[Jes Staley] understands corporate and investment banking well, the re-positioning of which is one of our major priorities. \\"In Jes Staley we believe we have an executive with the appropriate leadership talent and wide-ranging experience to deliver shareholder value and to take the Group forward strategically.\\" James Staley, 59, is a former chief executive of JP Morgan Chase's investment bank. He spent more than 30 years of his career there before joining hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management in 2013. A longstanding lieutenant of JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, Mr Staley was at one point thought to be in line to take over as chief executive of the US bank. Three years ago, US business news broadcaster CNBC reported that Mr Staley was, in fact, a finalist for the top job at Barclays in August 2012, - alongside his colleague Bill Winters. Both eventually lost out to insider Antony Jenkins. In 2015, Mr Staley was elected to the board of Swiss bank UBS to serve on the bank's risk committee. What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a man named Mr. Staley who got a new job at a bank called Barclays. He is going to be the boss there starting on December 1st. The old boss, a man named Antony Jenkins, was fired because he didn't agree with the other people who work there. Mr. Staley is being hired because people who give money to the bank think he can help Barclays do better in something called investment banking. They are going to pay Mr. Staley a lot of money in different ways, like salary, retirement money, and special pieces of the bank called shares. If he does a really good job, he can make up to £8.2 million a year. He's also getting extra shares because he had to leave another bank called JPMorgan to take this new job. Mr. Staley wants to help Barclays get better in a few different ways like doing more banking in Africa and changing the way they handle investment banking.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The return of Steve Hutchinson had the 12th man at Qwest Field in a frenzy. A knee injury to Matt Hasselbeck early in the second half silenced them. An early 72-yard touchdown reception by Darrell Jackson staked the Seahawks to a 7-3 lead, but the Vikings scored a TD of their own in the second quarter and the teams went to the half tied at 10. On the Hawks first possession of the 3rd quarter, Vikings LB E.J. Henderson rolled onto Hasselbeck's right leg and sent the QB to the turf well after he had released the ball. Hasselbeck left the field with the assistance of trainers, and did not return. Seneca Wallace took over at QB, completing 14 of 25 passes with two interceptions and a fumble in his own endzone. The Hawks gave up a 15-yard TD pass from RB Mewelde Moore to TE Jermaine Wiggins to trail 17-10 as Hasselbeck was walking to the locker room. They looked to have weathered the storm and recaptured momentum when punter Ryan Plackemeier pinned the Vikings on their own 5-yard line. The next play resulted in the Vikings' longest ever TD play, a 95-yard romp by Chester Taylor that brought back memories of Bo and the Boz. Suddenly the deficit was 14 points. The Hawks drove for an FG to cut the lead to 11, but a failure to convert a 4th and 1 play on the next drive ended any hope of pulling out the game. The loss ended the Seahawks' 12-game winning streak at home. An MRI scan on Hasselbeck's knee revealed a second degree sprain and he missed 4 games. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 4-2 and their 12-game winning streak at home was snapped. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Why were the fans excited about Steve Hutchinson's return? Steve Hutchinson used to be a very good player for the Seahawks, which is the team with the 12th man, or the fans, at Qwest Field. He then went to play for the Vikings, which was the team they were playing against in this game. So, the fans were excited to see him play again, even if it was for the other team.

Summarize this article: 275 °F (135 °C) is an average temperature for long, slow roasting. You may adjust the temperature, but don't go below 200 °F (93 °C). Use higher temperatures to cut down on cooking time. City ham is what's commonly sold in supermarkets. They're often pre-cooked, so they won't need to spend as much time in the oven as uncooked hams. Spiral-sliced ham is basically a pre-cut type of city ham. It's also pre-cooked. The labeling on the packaging will tell you what kind of ham you have so you know how to heat it. Uncooked city hams exist, but are harder to find. They'll need to cook a bit longer than pre-cooked ham. Try to keep the side thicker with white-colored fat facing upwards. You may need to cut off a little bit of fat off the bottom to get the ham to lay flat. Leave most of it until later. When roasting half a ham, place the cut side on the pan. Baking sheets, broiler pans, and casserole dishes may also be used. Keep in mind that pans with elevated sides are better than flatter pans. Hold the ham flat and, using your chef's knife, begin scoring lines into the fat. Cut lines across the ham, then cut more down the ham's length. The pattern looks similar to a checkerboard. If there's a lot of fat, you can slice off some of it. Leave a thin layer about 1⁄4 in (6.4 mm) thick. Avoid cutting into the meat. Fill the bottom of the pan with 1 cup (240 mL) of water. If your pan doesn't have high sides, you'll need to check the pan as it cooks and replace the water as needed. The steam provides extra heat and protects the pan from burns. If you choose to cook the ham uncovered in the next step, you'll only need 1⁄4 in (6.4 mm) of water. Place a sheet of foil all the way over the pan. Wrap it tight around the pan's edges so it forms a tent over the ham. Using foil is optional, but it'll lead to a juicier, tastier ham. Alternatively, wrap the ham directly in foil or place it in a cooking bag. Include the water inside the foil or bag. You may also leave the ham uncovered and cook with less water. 2 hours is an average amount of time to wait before checking the ham's temperature. The specific amount of time will depend on the size of your ham. Estimate it'll take about 20 minutes per 1 lb (0.45 kg) of meat for an uncooked or partially-cooked ham and 15 minutes or less per pound for a fully-cooked ham. Bone-in hams have a little less meat than boneless hams, so adjust the timing as needed. If you're planning on glazing the ham, it's a good idea to make the glaze while the ham's cooking. Pull out the ham after 2 hours and unwrap the foil. Push the end of the thermometer into the thickest part of the ham. The temperature should read about 120 °F (49 °C). If it isn't, rewrap the foil and continue cooking. Remove the ham when it reaches the proper temperature. When using a liquid glaze, use a pastry brush to coat the outside of the ham. For dry glazes, carefully pat the glaze on by hand. The score marks you made will hold the glaze in place. Generally, the glaze should be added within the last 30 minutes of cooking time. You can also pull the ham out halfway through the cooking time to reapply the glaze. Put the ham back into the oven. After 20 minutes, the glaze will have finished cooking. Pull out the ham and test it again with the thermometer. Look for an internal temperature of 135 °F (57 °C) and continue roasting as needed to reach this temperature. If you used a cooking bag, you should skip this and let the ham rest for 15 minutes. If you need to glaze it and continue cooking, you can use a roasting pan. During these 15 minutes, the inside of the ham continues to cook. It also causes the ham to hold onto juices, preventing it from drying out. After the 15 minutes are up, slice the ham and serve it.","completion":"This article talks about how to cook a ham.

In detail: In a significant turn of events that took place last month, the Serbian authorities decided to take action regarding the international arrest warrant issued against Mirjana Markovic, who is the wife of the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. This decision resulted in the withdrawal of the arrest warrant that had been in effect for quite some time. Mirjana Markovic, once known as the \\"Lady Macbeth of the Balkans,\\" was an influential figure during the time her husband, Slobodan Milosevic, was in power. As a former professor and politician, she held a critical role in shaping the policies and decisions that marked the Milosevic era, a period characterized by numerous conflicts and political turmoil in the Balkans. Her husband, Slobodan Milosevic, was the President of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1989 until 2000, and his policies led to a series of wars and ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. He was accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, and was arrested in 2001. He died in 2006 in the detention center of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, Netherlands, before the conclusion of his trial. As for Mirjana Markovic, following her husband's arrest, she faced charges related to abuse of power and corruption. Consequently, the international arrest warrant was issued for her arrest. In 2003, she sought refuge in Russia and has been living there ever since. The circumstances that led to her eluding the Serbian justice system have been a subject of debate and controversy among those familiar with the situation. Now, with the Serbian authorities' decision to withdraw the international arrest warrant, it remains to be seen what implications this will have on Mirjana Markovic's future and her ability to potentially return to Serbia without fearing arrest.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla was loved","completion":"by many for his progressive ideals and relentless pursuit of democratic reform in Spain. The context provided indicates that Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla was a prominent figure among Progressists and Democrats in 1856, and actively participated in the revolutionary propaganda that led to the military movement in Madrid on June 22, 1866. Due to his involvement in political activities that challenged the established order, he was forced to flee to France for two years until the revolution of 1868 allowed him to return to his country. Given his dedication to progressive policies and democratic changes, it is reasonable to assume that Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla was indeed admired and loved by many individuals who shared his political beliefs and aspirations. As a pioneer of progressive ideology, Zorrilla likely gained the admiration of countless supporters who shared his vision for a more equitable and democratic Spain. His unwavering commitment to the cause, which extended to the point of self-exile, would have impressed upon his followers the depth of his conviction in the need for reform. Moreover, his return to Spain following the revolution of 1868 demonstrates his continued engagement in the democratization process of his country. As a leader willing to persevere through hardship and exile in order to champion his beliefs, Zorrilla would have naturally attracted the love and admiration of those who sought a more just and democratic society. In conclusion, the next sentence does follow given the preceding context, as Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla's dedication to progressive and democratic values, his involvement in the revolutionary propaganda, and his personal sacrifices made for the cause would have made him a highly admired and loved figure among his supporters and fellow Democrats. While his strategies and methods may have been controversial among some, there is no denying that Zorrilla played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of Spain during his time, thus earning him the love and respect of many who concurred with his ideals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bull Durham Context: \\"Crash\\" Davis (Costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski)[2][3] about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby's haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of \\"Meat\\", and they get off to a rocky start. Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a \\"baseball groupie\\" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the \\"Church of Baseball\\" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to \\"try out\\" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he \\"believes in\\", ending with \\"I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night\\". Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname \\"Nuke\\"). Crash forces Nuke to learn \\"not to think\\" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his \\"heat\\" (fastballs). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in \\"The Show\\" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for \\"the 21 greatest days of my life\\" and to which he has tried for years to return.

UPDATED:. 17:42 EST, 29 January 2014. A college professor today calmly live tweeted the moment he was told his plane would make an emergency landing and oxygen masks dropped from the cabin roof. Shashi Bellamkonda, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, was on the flight from Washington DC to Boston this morning when smoke started coming out of the cabin's vents. But he and the total 58 passengers remained calm and the Embraer 170 aircraft eventually landed at a small regional airport without incident. He told MailOnline that it was midway through the flight when the oxygen masks dropped, but most of the passengers didn't even put them on until instructed by the crew. One last snap: Georgetown professor Sashi Bellamkonda (left) took this picture as his flight from Washington DC to Boston had to make an emergency landing this morning. Calm: Mr Bellamkonda and his seat mate were calm enough to take selfies during the emergency landing. Soon after, the pilot came over the intercom to announce that they would not make it to Boston, and would need to make an emergency landing because air pressure had dropped. Mr Bellamkonda said the atmosphere in the cabin remained calm, with passengers joking and taking pictures which she says is a testament to 'the period we live in'. There was a little bit of stress amongst the passengers over whether there would be a water landing, but luckily the pilot was able to set down at a small airport in Wilmington, Delaware. Once safely out of the plane, the passengers had to suffer for a while in the bitter cold on the tarmac until the airport could dispatch buses to bring them inside to the terminal. Safe but cold! The flight made a safe landing at a small airport in Wilmington, Delaware but the passengers had to wait for a while in the bitter cold for a bus to take them to the terminal. Out in the cold: Mr Bellamkonda sends a picture of the runway to United, asking for answers. And it wasn't until mid-afternoon that another plane was brought in to take them on to their destination in Boston. United Airline spokesman Luke Punzenberger issued a statement following the emergency landing. 'The Mesa Air flight, operating as United Express, landed safely in Delaware and we are working to get our customers to their final destinations as quickly as possible. The flight crew diverted the plane after a report of smoke in the cabin,' Mr Punzenberger said. There were 58 people on board in addition to 4 crew members. But Mr Bellamkonda said he was happy with the way the situation played out, and is especially thankful to the pilot for a safe landing and to the small airport's hospitality. He says the airport even bought pizzas for the passengers to eat since they didn't have any food vendors. Limbo: United Airlines brought in another plane to take the flight to Boston around 2pm on Wednesday. In the hours between, the airport provided free pizza to the stranded passengers. Free pizza! The airport was kind enough to provide food for the stranded passengers. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday.

Indonesia is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia, comprising approximately 17,508 islands. It is the world's fourth most populous country, with an estimated population of around 270 million people. According to data on religious demographics, Muslims represent the majority of Indonesia's population. Approximately 87.2% of the Indonesian population identify as Muslims, which equates to roughly 229 million people. This large number of followers places Indonesia at the forefront in terms of the Muslim population globally. Islam reached Indonesia around the 13th century, and ever since, it has played a significant role in shaping the country's culture, politics, and societal structure. The major Islamic denomination in Indonesia is Sunni Islam, adhering to the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence. However, it is important to note that Indonesian Islam is famous for promoting religious tolerance and coexisting harmoniously with other religious communities, such as Christians, Hindus, and Buddhists. Following Indonesia, the countries with the next highest Muslim populations are: 1. Pakistan: With approximately 204 million Muslims, it is the world's second-most populous Muslim-majority country. Over 96% of Pakistan's population is Muslim, with the majority being Sunni, followed by a significant Shia minority. 2. India: Even though it is a Hindu-majority country, India has the third-largest Muslim population in the world, consisting of around 195 million Muslims or about 14% of the country's total population. Indian Muslims mainly practice Sunni Islam, but there is a notable Shia minority as well. 3. Bangladesh: This South Asian country has a population of about 164 million, with around 90% of them identifying as Muslims. Islam is the state religion of Bangladesh, but the country does promote religious freedom and tolerance.

They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her.

Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines. Severe allergic reactions may require an injection of the hormone epinephrine.

Step 4: Compare the symptoms between the two groups to determine which group had fewer people with a runny nose. - Based on the information provided, Group C experienced only severe symptoms which do not include runny noses.

Mass murderer Nikolas Cruz is getting stacks of fan mail and love letters sent to the Broward County jail, along with hundreds of dollars in contributions to his commissary account. Teenage girls, women and even older men are writing to the Parkland school shooter and sending photographs — some suggestive — tucked inside cute greeting cards and attached to notebook paper with offers of friendship and encouragement. Groupies also are joining Facebook communities to talk about how to help the killer. The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained copies of some of the letters showing that Cruz, who had few friends in the outside world, is now being showered with attention. The attraction of women to prison bad boys echoes the fascination with killers like notorious cult leader Charles Manson. Lyle and Erik Menendez, the Beverly Hills brothers convicted in 1994 of murdering their parents, attracted a pair of brides while spending life in prison. So-called “Bundyphiles” sent bags of mail to Ted Bundy, the serial rapist-murderer who was electrocuted on Florida’s Death Row in 1989. \\"I reserve the right to care about you, Nikolas!\\" wrotes a Texas woman in neat blue script in a letter addressed to the jail’s Post Office Box in Fort Lauderdale. The letter was mailed six days after Cruz murdered 17 students and staff and injured 17 others with an AR-15 rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14. Supporters express devotion to confessed Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz in letters, greeting cards and on Facebook. The killer's fans cite his diagnoses with autism and other disabilities, mental illness, and that he was bullied and orphaned as reasons why he deserves sympathy. (Doreen Christensen, Brittany Wallman) (Doreen Christensen, Brittany Wallman) The reverent note takes up all available space on the front and back of a kiddie-like greeting card showing a furry bunny holding binoculars looking out at the ocean. The inside of the card says, \\"Out of sight, but never out of mind.\\" A teenager wrote on March 15: “I’m 18-years-old. I’m a senior in high school. When I saw your picture on the television, something attracted me to you.” The letter was mailed from Texas and tucked inside an envelope covered with hand-drawn hearts and happy faces. “Your eyes are beautiful and the freckles on your face make you so handsome.” She goes on to describe herself as white with big, brown eyes. “I’m really skinny and have 34C sized breasts.” She ends the letter with three preschool-rated jokes about gummy bears and peanut butter. A woman from Chicago enclosed nine suggestive photos, including a shot of cleavage, another in a skimpy bikini eating a Popsicle and a tight shot of her backside as she bent over. Another girl sent photos with Hello Kitty Snapchat filters. An 18-year-old from New York wrote: “No one else is dealing w/your demons, meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend. I know you could use a good friend right now. Hang in there and keep your head up.\\" The letter closes with hearts colored in pink ink. \\"There's piles of letters,\\" said Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office is representing Cruz. \\"In my 40 years as public defender, I've never seen this many letters to a defendant. Everyone now and then gets a few, but nothing like this.\\" Not all of the letters are from women. One card with a cat on the front is from an New York man sporting a bushy, gray, mustache. He enclosed photos of himself behind the wheel of his white, 1992 Nissan convertible. Cruz has not seen the mail because he is on suicide watch, Finkelstein said. Customarily, inmates on suicide watch are locked in bare cells by themselves. The jail opens inmates’ mail (except legal mail), according to the Broward Sheriff’s Office inmate handbook. Obscene mail or mail deemed to be a safety or security threat to staff is returned to the sender, the handbook says. “We read a few religious ones to him that extended wishes for his soul and to come to God,” Finkelstein said, “but we have not and will not read him the fan letters or share the photos of scantily-clad teenage girls.” Finkelstein said he worries “everyday boys and girls are starting to view him in an elevated way, looking up to his fame and notoriety.” Confessed Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz appears in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom. \\"The letters shake me up because they are written by regular, everyday teenage girls from across the nation,” he said. “That scares me. It's perverted.” Jail workers have been busy screening letters, photos, greeting cards, postcards and the occasional book sent to Cruz, jail records show. Cruz requested a Bible, according to jail records released by the Broward Sheriff’s Office, but it was denied because of the suicide watch, the public defender said. Cruz also now has 800 deposited into his growing commissary account, apparently sent by fans, Finkelstein said. From Feb. 15 through March 5, 630 was deposited, jail records show. The county deducts 8 per day for “subsistence fees.” Inmates can use the commissary account to buy snacks, personal hygiene products, radios and coffee. Cruz’s fan club also extends to Facebook, with several groups of empathizers forming to talk about his case and how they can help him avoid the death penalty. On the “Nikolas Cruz – the First Victim,” a now-secret group that until recently had 300 members, one young woman solicited photos for a collage to send to the killer. “I want him to see how many people love and care for him and all the beautiful faces,” she posted. The page features a photo of Cruz wearing a baseball cap and glasses along with the hashtags #StopBullying and #OurBoy #NikFam. The group describes its mission as “in complete support of Nikolas Cruz. Whether or not he did this, he was completely failed. He deserved to get the help he needs and he deserves a fair trial.” “I want you all to know that Nikolas knows about us and he had the biggest smile on his face when he was told that we all support him,” a female commenter wrote on March 16. “Keep the letters coming because he can’t wait to finally get them.” She wrote that “hate mail is filtered out so no one can upset our boy!!! Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate.” ||||| A 13-year-old boy from Central Florida told police he wanted to be “the next school shooter” — allegedly going so far as to keep photos of confessed Parkland gunman Nikolas Cruz on his Playstation, along with images related to the Columbine massacre. “He wanted to kill a lot of kids,” said the Polk County Sheriff’s Office in an official incident report, recalling the Kissimmee teen’s alleged statements to cops. “He wanted to die and see God,” officials said, according to WESH Orlando. “He wanted to shoot up Westside K-8 School (in Osceola County, where he attended) because he wanted to be the next school shooter.” According to police, the boy had been found passed out on a sidewalk in Davenport on Saturday. He told deputies that he swiped a bottle of booze from his parents’ liquor cabinet and used it to down a bunch of “happy pills.” The teen claimed that he drank the whole thing, according to WESH. “He wanted to kill different kids because they ‘snitched’ on him and got him expelled from Westside K-8,” officials said, noting how he claimed to have been arrested and charged in the past for threatening a kid who “tried him.” The boy told cops on Saturday that he buried a handgun in his neighbor’s backyard — because he was afraid his mother would find it — but no weapon was ever found. “This teen is clearly in trouble,” explained Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. “We hope he receives the treatment he needs to deal with his desires to hurt himself and others, but we have also placed him under arrest for felony aggravated stalking,” she said. “We cannot allow anyone of any age to get away with criminal threats to kill, especially when they are aimed towards schoolchildren.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Mass murderer Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland school shooter, has been receiving stacks of fan mail, love letters, and financial contributions in Broward County jail.

Movie title: Gladiator Movie plot: In AD 180, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius leads the Roman army to a decisive victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the northern frontier. Now weary of battle, Maximus only desires to retire to his Spanish farm estate. But Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells him that his own son and heir, Commodus, is unfit to rule and appoints Maximus as regent to help save Rome from corruption. When the emperor reveals his plan to his son, Commodus murders him in a fit of rage. Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty. When the general refuses, he is arrested by his officers and is sentenced to death at dawn. He kills his captors and rides for his farm. However, he arrives too late to find it destroyed and his family murdered, under Commodus' orders. Maximus buries them and collapses from his wounds and grief. He is found by slavers who take him to Zucchabar, a colonia in the Roman North African province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to a lanista (gladiator trainer) named Proximo. Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators named Juba, a Numidian, and Hagan, a German. As he wins every match because of his military skills and indifference to death, he gains fame and recognition. But Proximo, who reveals that he himself was once a gladiator who fought well enough to be given his freedom, advises Maximus that being a good killer is not enough; a good gladiator is one who can \\"win the crowd\\". Proximo encourages Maximus to go to Rome and fight in the Colosseum because Commodus has organized 150 days of games. He could then use the power he commands in the arena as leverage against the Emperor. Maximus' first gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum is a re-enactment of the Roman victory over Carthage at the Battle of Zama. Although the gladiators (portraying the Carthaginians) are expected to be massacred, Maximus leads them to victory over the legionaries of Scipio Africanus. This prompts a...","completion":"The duel between Maximus and Commodus, the climax of the movie Gladiator, takes place in the Colosseum in Rome. Throughout the film, the Colosseum serves as the primary location for gladiatorial combats, and it is where Maximus gains fame and recognition as a skilled gladiator, aligning with his intentions to take revenge against Commodus. As the Colosseum was a central symbol of Roman power and a popular venue for entertainment, it serves as a fitting location for the climactic conflict between Maximus and Commodus. Holding the duel in the Colosseum also heightens the tension and stakes, as it positions Maximus not just as an individual seeking justice, but as a symbol of resistance against a corrupt emperor before a captive audience. An important aspect to consider when deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal is the potential for strong storytelling and character development. The movie Gladiator offers a compelling plot that combines elements of political intrigue, betrayal, and personal revenge, while providing viewers with an immersive look into the world of ancient Rome and its gladiatorial games. The central characters, Maximus and Commodus, are well-developed and serve as compelling foils for one another, highlighting the chasm between virtue, selflessness, and honor as embodied by Maximus and the corruption, cruelty, and egocentrism of Commodus. By pitting these two characters against each other in the Colosseum, the movie taps into both the historical context of the time and the human struggle between good and evil. In addition, the film's historical setting and attention to detail lends it an air of authenticity that can engage and educate audiences while also providing a strong foundation for visual spectacle. The inclusion of the Colosseum as both a symbolic and literal backdrop for the characters' struggles underscores how the grandeur and scale of the ancient world can be effectively exploited for dramatic effect. Additionally, Gladiator's plot and character arcs offer solid opportunities for actors to showcase their range and depth, potentially leading to strong performances that can further enhance the film's appeal. Sound production values and direction, combined with an engaging score, competitive marketing strategy, and the right cast, could all contribute to the movie's success in the box office and potentially garner critical acclaim. However, it is important to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. The film's historical setting and high production values might also come at a cost, requiring a significant investment in sets, costumes, special effects, and locations. Additionally, the film may be subject to scrutiny over historical accuracies or public reception, which could affect its overall performance and reputation. When considering this film proposal as an investment, it is essential to thoroughly review the budget, production plan, and projected financial returns, alongside evaluating the creative elements, as well as the potential audience appeal and market viability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In a competitive market, such as the one in Sweden, efficiency improvements can lead to worthwhile returns on investment. However, in Norway, where there is less competition among power suppliers, there might be less incentive to invest in efficiency improvements, thus making it harder to find attractive returns on investment.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be.

Article: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications. The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates . Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \\"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\\" said Munster.

Welding involves face and eye protection, as well as gloves, making this option contextually relevant. B). is putting on someone else's safety gear such as a combat vest and his parachute. This option suggests that the individual is preparing for a different type of activity, possibly something involving combat or parachuting.

Frequently; Given those answer options, answer the question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.

A team from the School of Dentistry's Violence Research Group studied drinking habits in children aged 11 - 16 in England. They found not only a link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit, even if they weren't violent themselves. The researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk. Current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization. More than 4,000 children were surveyed at 13 schools at four local authorities in the North, the Midlands, London, and the South. The study found that 25% of 11-year-olds were drinking monthly and 3.6% daily, with 12.8% admitting to getting drunk 3 to 5 times a year. By the age of 16, 40% were drinking weekly and 6.2% were drinking every day. The research also showed 22.6% of 16-year-olds were getting drunk more than 21 times a year. The study, which has just been published in the Journal of Adolescence, found a strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people. However, children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit. Adolescents who drank but didn't get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight.

Given the question: Background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

(CNN) -- An ex-judge accusing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of manipulating court rulings is a fugitive who \\"sold his soul to the devil\\" when he agreed to talk with U.S. investigators, the nation's foreign minister said Thursday. \\"People like him will keep being defeated and his lies will be unveiled,\\" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said. Eladio Aponte Aponte, who was a Supreme Court justice until the Venezuelan government accused him of connections with an alleged drug trafficker last month, told SOiTV in an interview that aired this week that he made rulings in cases based on requests from Chavez and other top officials. When asked whether there were political prisoners in Venezuela -- something Chavez has previously denied --","completion":"Aponte Aponte said in the interview that it was true there were people detained on political grounds and that these requests were often made by Chavez himself or his close associates. He added that the Venezuelan judiciary system had become deeply entangled in the political framework, making it almost impossible for the courts to render fair and impartial decisions in such cases. This revelation sparked outrage among opposition groups, who have long accused the Chavez administration of human rights abuses and the suppression of dissent. In response to the allegations, the Venezuelan government launched a campaign to discredit Aponte, claiming that his actions were motivated by personal vendettas against the authorities and that he was attempting to gain favor with the United States. This was further fueled by reports from state-run media outlets asserting that Aponte had met with U.S. officials shortly before his dismissal, suggesting a possible conspiracy. As tension between the opposition groups and the Venezuelan government escalated, protests erupted across the country demanding the release of political prisoners and a call for judicial reform. Faced with mounting public pressure, the Chavez administration announced the formation of a commission to investigate the allegations of political interference within the judiciary. However, critics argued that the commission was comprised mainly of government loyalists and that its findings would likely be biased in favor of the administration. The situation reached international attention when the United Nations and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International expressed concern over the treatment of political prisoners and the integrity of the Venezuelan judicial system. In response, the UN Human Rights Council unanimously passed a resolution urging the Venezuelan government to take immediate steps to address these concerns, including the prompt release of political prisoners and the establishment of a more transparent and impartial judiciary. Despite the international community's demands, President Hugo Chavez remained defiant and criticized the resolution as an example of foreign interference in Venezuela's domestic affairs. He accused the United States and other Western powers of using this issue to destabilize his government and promote regime change in the country. As the crisis persisted, it became clear that the Venezuelan government would not yield to the pressure and continued to resist calls for judicial reform and the release of political prisoners. This ongoing dispute significantly weakened the already-straining relationship between Venezuela and the international community, particularly the United States, culminating in diplomatic standoffs and a deepening sense of mistrust. In conclusion, the most logical completion of this news story would be that the accusations made by ex-judge Aponte Aponte would further entrench the political divide in Venezuela and exacerbate existing tensions with the international community. Despite calls for reform and the release of political prisoners, the Chavez administration would remain steadfast in their denial and defiance of the allegations, resulting in an increasingly isolated and polarized Venezuelan nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kennedy, the 36-year-old grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and great-nephew of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy, has been a low-key presence in the House since he was first elected in his Boston-area district in 2012. But he emerged last week as a major Democratic voice against the Republican health care bill, delivering several speeches in a committee’s all-night session that have been viewed millions of times on the internet. While the technology may be new, his support for the Obama-era health care law and more services for the poor are familiar Kennedy territory. Sen. Ted Kennedy spent decades pushing for comprehensive health care before his death from brain cancer in August 2009. Now his great-nephew is fighting Republicans who are trying to unravel the 2010 law. They say the system is failing as premiums have risen and insurers have pulled out. Kennedy challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had called the GOP replacement bill an “act of mercy.” “With all due respect to our speaker, he and I must have read different scripture,” Kennedy said during the debate. “The one that I read calls on us to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and to comfort the sick. It reminds us that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful, but how we care for the least among us.” He added: “This is not an act of mercy. It’s an act of malice.” His office posted the video on Facebook, and as of Monday, it had almost 10 million views and more than 225,000 shares. Kennedy acknowledged his family legacy but stressed that he can’t allow it to overwhelm his actions. “I obviously am very proud of what my family has accomplished and what they have done,” he said in an interview, but “if you try to do this job and carry that weight around, you’re never going to be able to do anything.” When talking about his grandfather’s speeches, he is emotional, putting his hand on his heart. “God, have you read some of his speeches?” he asks, and notes that a one-minute viral clip is an easier task. It’s clear that he’d rather be talking about the details of his opposition to the health bill. During the committee debate, he criticized the bill for its one-year freeze in Planned Parenthood funding, and the resulting decrease in health services for women, and the repeal of a requirement that state Medicaid plans must provide “essential health benefits,” including mental health care. A separate Facebook video of him talking about mental health care has more than 4 million views. That issue is important in his family — mainly to his cousin, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who left Congress in 2011 and has since been open about his own battles with substance abuse and mental health. Now an advocate for increased mental health services, Patrick Kennedy says his cousin “managed to capture a moment when all eyes were on health care, and focus it with laser precision.” He says Joe is the right person to carry on the family legacy. “Most members have to be around for a long time and pay their dues before they garner the kind of credibility he’ll have,” Patrick said of Joe. “The fact is, is he going to use that to good purpose? As he demonstrated this week, he is not only prepared but is using to good purpose that incredible family legacy he was given by birth.” One of Kennedy’s good friends in Congress is Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a 39-year-old Oklahoma Republican who entered Congress with Kennedy four years ago and says he disagrees with the Massachusetts Democrat on almost everything. Mullin says they joke a lot, but they rarely joke about health care. They both sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where they took opposite sides on the bill last week. “He doesn’t speak out very often. He’s not someone that is front and center,” Mullin said. “But health care is something that is very important to him.” The internet took notice, with retweets and Twitter shout-outs from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who tweeted: “Wow. This is a Kennedy who could be President. A must watch.” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi cited his “passion and his leadership.” New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a lawmaker who worked with both Ted Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy before Joe came to Congress, says his party needs more young people talking about the benefits of the health care law, since many don’t think it helps them. Joe Kennedy says millennials are engaged, apolitical, want the system to work and want solutions. “Trying to get to some of the solutions here is difficult,” Kennedy said. “But we need to find a way to get there.”","completion":"Joe Kennedy, the grandson of the late Sen. Robert F.

Answer the following question: Information: - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - Byrsa was the walled citadel above the harbour in ancient Carthage . It was also the name of the hill it rested on . The name is derived from the Phoenician word for citadel . In Virgil 's account of Dido 's founding of Carthage , when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa , the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide . Therefore , Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa . This story is considered apocryphal , and was most likely invented because Byrsa sounds similar to the Greek word , meaning oxhide . The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage . It was besieged by Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in the Third Punic War and was defeated and destroyed in 146 BC. Saint Louis Cathedral was built on Byrsa Hill starting in 1884 . Today , it serves as a cultural center . Today , the Byrsa , is part of the archaeological site of Carthage and in addition to the cathedral monument , has the Carthage National Museum built on it . - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

The empire extended over much of the coast of North Africa as well as encompassing substantial parts of coastal Iberia and the islands of the western Mediterranean Sea. - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City. What entity does 'byrsa' has the relation 'country' with? Answer:","completion":"Byrsa is related to the country of Tunisia, as it is located within the ancient city of Carthage, which is now part of the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Paragraph: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","completion":"Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production that reduced leaching of phosphates. This is because organic milk production tends to have a lower eutrophication potential compared to conventional milk production, like the one at Berry farm. Organic milk production, such as the one practiced at Rose farm, aims to reduce the environmental impact of dairy farming by using lower fertilizer application rates. This, in turn, results in decreased leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−). By reducing the utilization of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, organic farming methods help to minimize the contamination of water sources and soil, contributing to a more sustainable agriculture approach. It is important to note, however, that organic milk production may lead to increased land use per ton of milk due to the decreased crop yields per hectare that result from the limited use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. Moreover, organic dairy farms typically produce less milk per cow since the animals receive lower levels of concentrates. This practice may be associated with increased methane emissions due to the higher intake of roughage by the cows. In conclusion, Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production practices that contributed to the reduced leaching of phosphates as opposed to Berry farm, which focused on conventional milk production. Although organic dairy farming has its own set of challenges, it tends to have a lower environmental impact, particularly in terms of eutrophication potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Families of the 202 victims who died in the bombings of two nightclubs in Bali have marked the second anniversary of the attacks with emotional ceremonies on the Indonesian resort island and in Australia.","completion":"The event you are referring to concerns the tragic bombings that occurred on October 12, 2002, in Bali, Indonesia. Two separate bombs targeted popular nightclubs, namely the Sari Club and Paddy's Bar, both located in the busy tourist district of Kuta. The attacks were later discovered to be orchestrated by the terrorist group known as Jemaah Islamiyah, which had ties to al-Qaeda. These devastating bombings claimed the lives of 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, and numerous other citizens from around the world. The loss of life not only affected the families of the victims but also had a deep impact on the Bali locals and international communities collectively. On the second anniversary of the fateful event, emotionally-charged memorial ceremonies were organized both in Bali and Australia as a way for the grieving families, friends, and fellow nationals to come together in remembrance of the lives that were lost in the attacks. In Bali, much like in the previous year, mourning families placed flowers, lit candles, and released white doves as symbols of peace on the bomb site, located at the heart of the tourist district. Religious leaders from various faiths - including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism - led prayers and provided solace during the somber gathering, reflecting the diverse cultural background of the victims. A parallel commemoration ceremony was held in Australia, where a significant number of the victims hailed from. The Australian government arranged a gathering that brought together families, friends, and caring citizens who were distraught by the incident. The ceremony included the reading of the names of the Australian victims, observing moments of silence, and sharing of personal stories. Symbolic gestures, such as the forming of a 'survivors' circle,' further enabled attendees to remember and honor the lives of those who perished in the attacks. These memorial ceremonies served a dual purpose. Firstly, they helped provide collective grieving spaces for families, friends, and communities affected by the attacks. By coming together, they could offer mutual support and comfort, finding solace in their unity and shared experiences. Secondly, the ceremonies acted as a powerful reminder of the importance of vigilance against terrorism and the necessity of international cooperation in fighting such menaces. By commemorating the lives lost, the ceremonies symbolized a steadfast commitment to prevent such tragedies from recurring and ensuring that the memories of the victims would not be forgotten. The Bali bombings remain one of the most brutal terrorist attacks in recent history, and the anniversaries serve as a solemn reminder of the fragility of life and the need for global collaboration in maintaining peace and security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of the key positions in the sport is the goalkeeper, often hailed as the team's last line of defense. The pivotal role of a goalie cannot be underestimated, as their unique skill set can make or break a team's performance. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on the basic rules of soccer, the specific rules for goalkeepers, goalkeeper equipment, and organizational rules that might vary from one country to another. I. Learning the Basic Rules of Soccer Before diving into the specifics of the goalkeeper's role, it is crucial to understand the basic rules of soccer. Here are some essential rules to keep in mind: 1. The primary objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by kicking the ball into the opposing team's net. 2. There are two teams, each consisting of 11 players, including a goalkeeper. 3. The game is played in two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute break in between. 4. If a game ends in a tie, extra time and/or penalty shootouts may come into play as a tiebreaker, depending on the competition. 5. Players must avoid using their hands and arms to touch the ball unless they are the goalkeeper within their penalty area. 6. Offside rules restrict the movement of offensive players, preventing goal hanging and cherry-picking. II. Rules Specific to the Goalkeeper's Role Knowing the basic rules of soccer will make it easier to grasp the rules specifically tailored for goalkeepers. These include: 1. A goalkeeper may use their hands and arms to touch the ball within their designated goal area (the 18-yard box). 2. They may not touch the ball with their hands and arms outside of the penalty area. 3. Goalkeepers must release the ball within six seconds after gaining possession or controlling it with their hands. 4. They are not allowed to pick up the ball from a deliberate pass with their teammate's feet (backpass). 5. Goalkeepers must avoid touching the ball or moving off the goal line before a penalty kick is taken. III. Goalkeeper Equipment and Protective Gear Goalkeepers require specialized equipment to ensure their safety and optimize their performance, including: 1. Goalkeeper gloves: These gloves provide a better grip on the ball and protect fingers from injuries. 2. Goalkeeper jersey: This long-sleeved and padded garment distinguishes the goalie from other players and offers added padding for protection. 3. Soccer cleats: Appropriate footwear ensures good traction on the field, preventing slips and falls. 4. Shin guards: These protect the lower legs from injuries when engaging in tackles. 5. Padded shorts or goalkeeper pants: They provide extra protection for the hips, knees, and thighs during dives and slides. IV. Goalie Gameplay and Strategies A goalkeeper must be prepared to make saves, distribute the ball efficiently, and communicate with their team to coordinate defensive strategies. Key aspects of goalie gameplay include: 1. Positioning: Constantly adjusting and maintaining the right position in goal to effectively defend against shots. 2. Shot-stopping: Reacting quickly to save shots and prevent the ball from entering the net. 3. Distribution: Accurately and effectively passing the ball to teammates, utilizing both hands and feet. 4. Communication: Continuously offering guidance, directions, and encouragement to teammates to maintain defensive organization. V. Understanding Rules Specific to Your Country or Organization Lastly, it is important to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations specific to the soccer organization or league in which you will be participating. These rules may vary depending on factors like age, gender, and skill levels. Most organizations follow FIFA's Laws of the Game, but they may have slight variations or additional regulations in place that you must learn and adhere to as a goalkeeper. Conclusion Becoming a skilled and effective goalkeeper does not happen overnight, but understanding the basic rules of soccer, mastering the specific responsibilities of a goalie, acquiring proper equipment, and staying informed about regional rules can set you on the right path. With dedication, practice, and determination, anyone can rise to the challenge and make their mark as a formidable force on the pitch."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Richards, an unemployed heir living off a multi-million-dollar trust fund, was spared jail time when Judge Jurden reasoned that he \\"would not fare well\\" in prison. Attorney General Biden has recently shown his support for Judge Jurden's decision on the grounds that the case against Richards would have faced significant challenges during a trial due to its \\"weakness.\\" Biden's support comes amidst public outcry over the handling of the case, especially given the shocking details of the offense and an alleged assault on Richards' infant son revealed in a lawsuit brought on by his ex-wife, Tracy. The case has sparked a nationwide debate on the role that wealth and social status may play in influencing legal outcomes, as critics argue that Richards' influential background has unfairly kept him out of jail despite the severity of his alleged crimes. Supporters of Judge Jurden's decision, however, argue that the judge was faced with the difficult task of weighing the likelihood of a guilty verdict in a trial with insufficient evidence. As the debate surrounding the controversial call continues, one thing is certain - the outcome of this case has brought to light questions about the fairness and impartiality of the legal system, and has prompted renewed calls for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of judges and other legal authorities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While preparing the house for John, Clifford investigates footsteps in the attic. He is locked in the room, where a swarm of flies attack and kill him. John believes Clifford died of a stroke, even after Melanie shows him some photos she took of the real estate agent before his death which depict him as a rotting corpse. While John is at work, he nearly dies in a malfunctioning elevator. Simultaneously, Melanie experiences bizarre occurrences in John's house. She is found later that night by John, cowering and hysterical against the wall. Her attempts to convince John that something is inside the house fall on deaf ears. Later, while looking over blowups of the photos of Clifford, Melanie discovers a demonic-looking face in the pictures. When she attempts to show the photos to John, she is killed in a horrific car accident. Melanie's death is ruled accidental by everyone, including John, who remains oblivious to the evil in his home.

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as \`\`fixed'' or \`\`variable.'' For example, if a firm sinks 400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is \`\`sunk'' because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A \`\`fixed'' cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should not be deemed a \`\`fixed'' cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The \`\`variable costs'' for this project might include data centre power usage, for example. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is a fixed cost always a sunk cost? Options: (A). no. (B). yes.","completion":"(A). no. The best answer to the question is \\"no,\\" a fixed cost is not always a sunk cost. Fixed costs are continuous costs for as long as the business is in operation and are unaffected by output volume. Examples of fixed costs include monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal. In contrast, sunk costs are one-time expenses that cannot be recovered once spent, such as the 400 million spent on the enterprise software installation. While both fixed and sunk costs can be considered retrospective and prospective costs, they should not be confused with one another since they have different characteristics and implications for business decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: a bar with 2 girls and a man sitting on a table Hypothesis: People are walking along the beach. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the information given in the premise, it would be inaccurate to conclusively infer the hypothesis. The premise describes a scene within a bar where two girls and a man are sitting on a table. The crucial details in the premise entail an inside setting and the presence of three people. The premise does not extend information about additional scenes or events happening outside the bar. Therefore, the context remains restricted to the interior of the establishment and the individuals mentioned. Meanwhile, the hypothesis introduces an entirely separate scenario with people walking along the beach. This situation is completely unrelated to the original premise as it has no reference from a bar setting or the presence of the two girls and a man. Instead, it introduces a new locale, which is outside and involves a beach, and an unidentified group of people engaged in a different activity – walking. In argument logic, to draw an accurate conclusion from a premise, there should be a logical transition or extension from the information provided. The hypothesis, in this case, does not fit into this logical chain since it introduces new elements that cannot be inferred based on the initial premise. Hence, from the provided premise concerning a scenario in a bar, we cannot conclude people are walking along the beach, as the hypothesis suggests. The scenario described in the premise does not contain any information about a beach or people walking along it. In conclusion, the premise does not provide any assertion whether this scene at the bar is happening near a beach, far from it, or even during a time in which people would typically be walking along the beach.

Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others. Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the filmâthe idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes. After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it. The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.
