Here are some observations about the premise: 1. The woman is wearing heavy makeup - This could suggest various reasons behind her choice of wearing makeup, such as an event, a personal preference or style, or even a job requirement. However, the premise does not specify that the event in question is a beauty contest. 2.

So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\" However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey.

Shelton is left feeling betrayed.Ten years later. Ames is executed via lethal injection. Due to an alteration in the chemicals, he dies in agonizing pain. Initial evidence leads to Darby, who is alerted to approaching police by a mysterious caller who tells him where a pistol he can use to his advantage is.

Summarize: The group of Olympians - including gold medallists Jason Kenny and Laura Trott - said encouraging more people to use bikes instead of cars would be \\"the best way\\" to honour their success. They called on the PM to address \\"chronic underfunding\\" in cycling. The Department for Transport said investment had tripled since 2010. Team GB enjoyed a record-breaking Olympics and topped the cycling medal table at Rio 2016 for the third games in a row. Downing Street has since implied there would be \\"no limit\\" to the number of honours given to Olympic heroes. But signatories to the letter - including Mark Cavendish, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Becky James and Sir Chris Hoy - said the best way to mark their achievements would be to invest in cycling. A \\"lack of leadership\\" has kept cycling as a mode of transport \\"in the slow lane\\", they said. Cycling \\"does not enjoy the government investment or political leadership given to roads, rail or aviation,\\" the letter added. \\"Only networks of segregated cycle lanes in towns and cities across the country can achieve and influence growth,\\" it said. The letter called for 5% of the government's transport spending to go on cycling, saying this was the \\"only way\\" to give it \\"the priority it deserves\\". \\"Investment in cycling as a form of transport isn't purely an investment in cycle lanes,\\" it said. \\"It is an investment that will pay off for the nation's health, wealth, transport infrastructure and the vibrancy of our towns and cities. It has the added benefit of just making it easier for ordinary families to get to work and get to school. \\"Our athletes have inspired the country and now we urge the government to take cycling seriously as a transport option for everyone.\\" Chris Boardman, Elinor Barker, Owain Doull and Katy Marchant also signed the letter. Boardman, a former Olympic champion who is now British Cycling's policy advisor, said cycling \\"isn't only a sport\\", but a way for people to get to school and to the shops. He told BBC Radio 5 live the death of his mother - who was killed while cycling in North Wales in July - had made him more determined to campaign for new cycling routes. He described her death as \\"needless\\" and called for \\"protected spaces\\" not mixed in with fast-moving traffic. In March, the government unveiled proposals to encourage people to cycle and walk more in England. The Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy includes the ambition of doubling the number of people using bikes by 2025. The government is now considering feedback on the draft plan. The Department for Transport said it was spending Â£300m on cycling funding - as well as a further Â£500m for infrastructure in local communities. \\"The number of people choosing to get about by bike has grown over recent years and, following the success of our Rio Olympians, we want to see this trend continue,\\" a spokesman said.

Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

Arnold Jacob Auerbach was one of the four children of Marie and Hyman Auerbach. Hyman was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Marie Auerbach, nee Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Russia when he was 13, and the couple owned a delicatessen store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Little Arnold spent his whole childhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playing basketball. In 1941, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the St. Albans School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C. Two years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA. In the 1946-47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49-11 win-loss record, including a standard-setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games. The next year the Capitols went 28-20 but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948-49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38-22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned. After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he \\"felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die\\" and that it was \\"no way to get a job\\". Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949-50 NBA season with a losing record of 28-29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again.

Kraven brought back a brand cut from Lucian's arm as proof of his death, a deed which earned Kraven high favor with Viktor, who put Kraven in charge of their coven. The great blaze caused the Lycans to scatter. Vampire Death Dealers, armed with silver bullets and shuriken, have been picking Lycans off one by one until very few remain.Present time: Three Death Dealers--Selene, Rigel, and Nathaniel -- follow two Lycans into a subway station in an unnamed European city. A firey gun battle ensues in which Rigel is killed, one of the Lycans gets away, and Nathaniel comes up missing. In the chaos, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) makes two discoveries: 1) the Lycans have devised an ultraviolet bullet that can kill vampires, and 2) there appears to be a large band of Lycans amassing under the subway.Selene hurries back to alert the Vampires at Kraven's luxurious masnion that sits on the outskirts of the city, but they are more interested in the clothes they are going to wear at tonight's formal party with the coven from across the 'great ocean' in celebration of the upcoming awakening of Marcus by Amelia, the current reigning Elder. Not interested in their gaities, Selene views some digital photos Rigel took of the Lycans and notices that they appear to have been following a human.

The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option.

After his wife and child are killed, Arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths. Director Duccio Tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace, maintains a properly serious and no-nonsense tone throughout, stages the stirring shoot-outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip-snorting brio, and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence.

A:","completion":"As of October 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more hat-tricks than Lionel Messi in their respective careers. However, it is essential to note that these numbers may change as both players are still active in their careers. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a total of 57 hat-tricks across all competitions for his clubs (Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Manchester United again) and the Portuguese national team. Out of these, he scored 9 hat-tricks for Manchester United, 1 for Sporting Lisbon, 36 for Real Madrid, 2 for Juventus, and 9 for the Portugal national team. On the other hand, Lionel Messi has scored a total of 54 hat-tricks in his career, all of which were scored playing for FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Messi scored 48 hat-tricks for FC Barcelona and 6 for Argentina. However, it is crucial to underline that comparing the number of hat-tricks does not necessarily represent which player is better or more skilled. Both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi possess different qualities and have had an exceptional impact on the football world. Even though Ronaldo has more hat-tricks, Messi has a higher goal-scoring average per game, having played fewer professional games than Ronaldo. Ultimately, both players have numerous records and accolades to their names, but as of now, Cristiano Ronaldo holds the advantage in terms of hat-tricks scored with 57, compared to Lionel Messi's 54."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: To determine the total pay packages of Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A) coaches for their current contract years, USA TODAY—in partnership with the National Sports Law Institute of Marquette University Law School and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP—requested all forms of compensation for the head football coach at all 120 schools. At least some information was obtained on all but 10 schools, most of which are private. Three public schools did not provide contracts; 15 declined to provide the NCAA-mandated outside income report, which covers athletically related income the coach receives from non-university sources. Schools that provided contract information were given the opportunity to review their figures. A 0 means the coach doesn't get compensation from that source or the school did not release the information. University compensation: Base salary; income from contract provisions other than base salary that are paid, or guaranteed, by the university or affiliated organizations, such as a foundation. For example, payments in consideration for: shoe and apparel use; television, radio or other media appearances; personal appearances. Also includes deferred payments earned annually; conditional deferred payments earned annually; certain payments based on attendance, ticket revenue or sales; contractual expense account or housing allowance. It does not include other amounts that may have been earned as annual incentive bonuses, the value of standard university benefits such as health care or the value of potentially taxable items such as cars; country club memberships; game tickets for the regular season, postseason and other sports; the value of stadium suites, travel upgrades, or spouse/family travel and game tickets. Salaries reported do not take into account deductions that have, or may, occur because of state government furlough, or other pay-reduction, actions. Non-university compensation: Income from sources listed on the coach's self-reported athletically related outside income report. Total: Combination of university and non-university compensation. Maximum bonus: The greatest amount that can be received if team meets prescribed on-field performance goals (e.g., win totals, bowl game appearances, conference and/or national championships, coach of the year awards, etc.), academic and/or player conduct goals. Alabama: University compensation includes a 533,333 contract-year completion bonus for the 2009-10 contract year. It accrued and was paid in April under an amendment that otherwise annualized the accruals and payments of what had been three one-time completion bonuses. Those bonuses, totaling 5 million, were added to the contract in September 2009 and would have been paid in 2012, 2015 and 2018. The first regular annual accrual occurred Sept. 1, 2010. Connecticut: Edsall receives additional compensation under a shoe/apparel contract and from his annual camp. The university declined to release information about either. Iowa: University compensation includes a 100,000, one-time signing bonus from a new contract this year that was to be paid by Dec. 31. Middle Tennessee: University compensation includes a 15,000 bonus that will be due if Stockstill remains the head coach as of Dec. 31. North Carolina: Davis receives additional compensation under media and shoe/apparel contracts the university declined to release. The deals paid him 499,000 in 2007 and were scheduled to pay 505,000 in 2008, the university said in 2007. The university declined to release the amount this year. Purdue: Hope is guaranteed this amount for the 2010 season because his bonus earnings, when added to a base salary of 220,000 and supplemental fixed compensation of 335,000, will not exceed the guaranteed amount. In the future, if his base salary and bonuses exceed the guaranteed amount, he will receive only the base salary and the bonuses. Temple: Information is from a report required by Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law. Texas Christian: The school's athletics department told USA TODAY in fall 2009 that Patterson's compensation for that year was 1.8 million. In December 2009, he received a two-year contract extension through 2016; the school did not release financial terms. USA TODAY was assisted in the analysis of contracts by students from the National Sports Law Institute of Marquette University Law School and Stinson Morrison Hecker LLP, whose practice areas include representation of college coaches through its affiliate, Premier Stinson Sports, as well as representation of athletics directors and NCAA member institutions.

Morales died hours after giving birth and did not get... (Associated Press) Erica Morales, 36, never got to hold her newborns before she passed away early Friday morning after a C-section surgery at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Nicole Todman said. \\"They were transporting her from the surgery to whatever room, and she was still unconscious at that point. So, no, she never got to see them,\\" Todman said. Morales was about seven months into her pregnancy when she delivered three girls and one boy Thursday, according to Todman. She has been one of the few able to visit the premature newborns and said they are doing well. \\"They're beautiful,\\" Todman said. \\"They have tubes in their mouths and their noses. They've got little monitors and wires all over their body.\\" The infants will likely remain hospitalized for the next two months while doctors help them to get stronger and each reach a goal weight of 5 pounds, Todman said. Currently, they all weigh between just above 2 pounds to just above 3 pounds, she said. Morales was initially hospitalized for high blood pressure. Complications ensued before Morales was taken into surgery, Todman said. She does not know what led to her passing. \\"I don't even care to know,\\" Todman said. \\"It doesn't matter why. She's still gone.\\" Hospital spokeswoman Toni Eberhardt declined comment Saturday, but she released a statement from the hospital: \\"Our heartfelt thoughts and condolences are with the family during this very difficult time.\\" Morales, a former real estate agent who more recently worked for the University of Phoenix, and her husband, Carlos, who works in manufacturing, had been trying to conceive a baby for two years, Todman said. She said Morales tried everything from acupuncture to fertility treatments. Morales suffered a miscarriage before becoming pregnant last June. Todman, who has been best friends with Morales since childhood, said Morales was more nervous about being a new mother than raising four children at once. Because of her previous miscarriage, Morales was apprehensive about getting too excited about the babies' arrival. She mainly focused on doing things correctly throughout her pregnancy such as eating enough, Todman said. \\"Her focus of her pregnancy was to make sure she did everything to make sure they were healthy so she was able to bring them into this world — and she did,\\" Todman said. On Friday, Todman started a GoFundMe fundraising website for Carlos Morales and the infants on Friday. The site had received more than 29,000 in donations as of Saturday afternoon. \\"I'm so grateful for the overwhelming support and the wonderful comments, and so are Carlos and Sandra, Erica's mother. They are so entirely grateful,\\" Todman said. ||||| PHOENIX, Arizona - The quadruplets of Phoenix mom Erica Morales, who died right after childbirth, are doing well, family members said. Baby girls Paisley, Tracey and Erica and baby boy Carlos were born Thursday night, seven months into Morales' pregnancy. All four them weighed between 2 to 3 pounds, reports CBS affiliate KPHO in Phoenix. Morales, however, entered the hospital with high blood pressure last Tuesday, and didn't survive giving birth. Nicole Todman/GoFundMe \\"She loved them she was so happy to welcome them to this world,\\" Erica's friend, Nicole Todman, told KPHO. \\"She loved their father and he loved her and that they will never be without love.\\" Morales never got to hold her kids, Todman said, because she was unconscious by the time they were delivered by C-section. Officials have yet to release an official cause of death. Morales, a real estate agent, and her husband, Carlos, who works in manufacturing, had been trying to conceive a baby for two years, Todman said. She said Morales tried everything from acupuncture to fertility treatments. Morales suffered a miscarriage before becoming pregnant last June. Nicole and Christina Todman told KPHO they consider themselves Erica's sisters. The three had known each other since grade school. They were there Thursday when Erica went into deliver her. \\"We are here for this,\\" Christina Todman said. \\"We are here to be a mother figure for these children because they are never going to meet their biological mother.

Movie title: One Eight Seven Movie plot: Trevor Garfield is an African American high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Dennis Broadway, a gangster student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a shiv. Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a substitute teacher, has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a Chicano tag crew by the name of \\"Kappin' Off Suckers\\" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito \\"Benny\\" ChacÃ³n, a felon attending high school as a condition of probation, makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect. The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he disappears, and Benny's unstable tag partner, CÃ©sar, takes over as leader. When CÃ©sar steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action. Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress, an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school. The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. CÃ©sar, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one...

The first step is to simplify the numbers on the left side of the equation. In our case, that's 34 - 1. The result is 33. 2. Substitute this result back into the equation. After substituting, the equation becomes 33 = 11*h. 3. The next step is to isolate h, which means we need to get h by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to eliminate 11 from the right side. Since 11 is multiplying h, we do the opposite operation, division, to eliminate it. 4. Divide 33 by 11. The result is 3. 5. Replace h with the result of this division. Hence, h = 3. So, the solution to the equation 34 - 1 = 11*h is h = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Now, I have a new situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Answer this question please: Which farm provided extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn?","completion":"The Brown farm provided extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn by choosing to grow cover crops. This decision helped in promoting hyphal growth and creating a more extensive hyphal network, which in turn increased mycorrhizal colonization.

The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

The new “Driving Under the Influence of Electronics” law puts stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in cars, reports the Seattle Times. Even when stopped at a red light or in standstill traffic, drivers can be ticketed for simply holding their phones. The law allows phone usage strictly in emergency situations or with apps that are voice-activated, controlled through dashboards, or mounted for map navigation that requires “minimal use” of fingers. Per USA Today, offenders will be slapped with a 136 fine for first offenses; the penalty increases to 234 for additional offenses within five years. Police will report offenses to insurance companies and they’ll also appear on driving records. Non-electronic distractions like applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap are also restricted as a secondary offense and run a 99 fine. “If I see you speeding and as you speed by me, I see that you're eating a big old cheeseburger, that's a secondary,” Washington State Patrol trooper Will Finn explained to Fox 12 during a ride along, during which he pulled over a driver (who was “shocked” to find out about the law) for speeding while eating an ice cream cone. Finn added that educating drivers is key in the first stages of the law to get to Washington’s Traffic Safety Commission’s \\"Target Zero\\" goal of no deaths on the road by 2030.

A) plants are dangerous to animals B) animals are dangerous to plants C) plants want to get what they need from animal me D) plants want to protect themselves against animals Answer:","completion":"Some plants eat animal meat because they want to acquire essential nutrients, particularly nitrogen, that they cannot obtain sufficiently from their surrounding environment. In certain regions, the soil may be nutrient-poor, lacking the elements required for a plant's growth and development. While most plants can derive their necessary nutrients from the sunlight, air, and soil, carnivorous plants have adapted to supplement their nutritional requirements through the consumption of animal meat. The Venus flytrap, for instance, is a well-known carnivorous plant species native to dry areas in the United States. Its unique leaf structure allows it to rapidly trap and consume insects, such as flies. The leaves function like a book, with pairs that can open and close swiftly. Each leaf contains three delicate hairs that trigger the leaf's closure when an insect makes contact. The trapped insect is unable to escape, and within approximately thirty minutes, the plant proceeds to digest and absorb the nutrients from the insect's body. This process allows the Venus flytrap, as well as other carnivorous plants like pitcher plants and sundews, to compensate for the nutrient deficiencies in their native habitats. Consuming animal meat provides them with the vital nitrogen and other nutrients they need to survive and thrive. Thankfully, these plants primarily target small insects and do not pose a threat to humans. However, some larger carnivorous plants can consume bigger prey, such as small mammals or amphibians. It is crucial to remain informed and vigilant about these extraordinary plants and the ecosystems in which they exist."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Result: I found several reputable websites showcasing the world's greatest paintings and drawings by famous painters, such as the websites of the Louvre Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Uffizi Gallery. However, the best site would depend on a person's preferences and what they're looking for. For a comprehensive collection of art, museums and galleries with an online presence like Google Art would be ideal. For Question 2, I will find the painters who are famous for painting flowers.

Here is a goal: How to Make Homemade Instant Oatmeal Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To make homemade instant oatmeal, the method that makes the most sense would involve creating a dry mixture of oats and flavorings that can be easily cooked with boiling water or hot milk. This method is convenient and adaptable, allowing for a variety of flavors to be added according to personal preference. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to making homemade instant oatmeal. Materials/Ingredients: - 3 cups of Quick oats - 2 tablespoons of powdered milk, powdered almond milk, or powdered coconut milk - Individual containers (zip-top bags, mason jars, etc.) - Desired additions like nuts, dried fruit, sweetener, and spices Procedure: 1. Gather Your Materials: Collect all the needed materials and ingredients before starting. This includes your oats, powdered milk, and your preferred flavor additions. Quick oats are especially recommended because they will soften quicker when hot water is added. 2. Prepare the Oats: In a large bowl, blend 1 cup of your quick oats until it forms a fine flour. This step aids in the quick absorption of water when rehydrating your instant oatmeal, creating a creamier end result. 3. Combine the Ingredients: After the oats are blended, mix the oat flour with the remaining 2 cups of unblended quick oats in your large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of powdered milk (regular, almond, or coconut) to the oats. This will help make your oatmeal creamier once cooked. 4. Customize Your Oatmeal: This is where you get to add some flavor to your oatmeal. You can add a variety of sweeteners such as sugar, honey, stevia or maple syrup as well as spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice. Consider adding chopped dried fruits like raisins, cranberries, apricots, or nuts like almonds, walnuts or pecans for extra texture and nutrients. Choose your own combinations to suit your taste. 5. Portion the Oatmeal: Divide the oatmeal mixture into individual bags or mason jars. These work great for one or two servings of oatmeal. Each serving should be about half a cup. 6. Prepare the Oatmeal: To prepare your homemade instantaneous oatmeal, simply add your portioned oatmeal mixture to a bowl, heat up 3/4 to 1 cup of water or milk until it's hot but not boiling, and then pouring it over your instantaneous oatmeal. Let it sit until the oats have absorbed all the liquid (about 2-3 minutes), stir, and enjoy. 7. Alternate Cooking Method: If you prefer, you can also cook the oatmeal in the microwave. Place your oatmeal and liquid in a microwave-safe dish, then microwave on high for 1-2 minutes. Make sure to watch carefully to prevent it from boiling over. This method for homemade instant oatmeal is practical because it's just as fast as using store-bought packets but allows for customization to everyone's taste and dietary needs. It also offers a more economical and less wasteful alternative, reducing the need for single-use packaging. This, combined with the ability to make bulk quantities in advance, makes homemade instantaneous oatmeal an excellent option for busy mornings. With this method, you'll have a quick, delicious, and nutritious breakfast ready in no time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the last name of Drake's mentor?, using the article: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Write the answer: Possession of what was made illegal in California, the first part of the USA to do so, on 6 October 1966?","completion":"Possession of LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide), a powerful hallucinogenic drug, was made illegal in California on 6 October 1966, making it the first part of the United States to criminalize the substance. LSD, also known as \\"acid,\\" is a psychedelic drug synthesized from lysergic acid, which is found in ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann while he was researching the potential medical applications of lysergic acid derivatives. It wasn't until 1943 that Hofmann accidentally ingested a small quantity of the substance and discovered its potent hallucinogenic effects. In the 1950s and 1960s, LSD captured the interest of psychiatrists who believed it could be used as a therapeutic tool for treating mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. During the 1960s, the drug gradually gained popularity among counter-culture activists and artists who embraced its mind-expanding abilities as a tool for self-exploration, creativity, and spirituality. People like Timothy Leary, a Harvard psychologist, promoted the use of LSD for its perceived ability to broaden consciousness, gain deeper insights into one's self, and break free from societal norms. This ultimately led to a surge in recreational use among the youth, promoting an anti-establishment attitude that was closely associated with the countercultural movements of the time. The increasing prevalence and visibility of LSD use among American youth alarmed lawmakers and the general public. Media reports at the time often associated the drug with dangerous behaviors and highlighted stories of individuals who had suffered adverse reactions, accidents, or even fatalities as a result of taking LSD. Amid growing concerns over public safety and the potential negative impact of the drug on mental health, the State of California moved to ban the substance in an effort to curb its use and distribution. On 6 October 1966, California became the first state to pass a law making the possession, sale, and manufacture of LSD illegal. This move marked the beginning of a nationwide crackdown on LSD and an increased emphasis on the enforcement of drug laws. Eventually, in 1970, the Controlled Substances Act was passed on a federal level in the United States, classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance. Schedule I drugs are considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and their possession, sale, or manufacture is prohibited under federal law. Ultimately, the prohibition of LSD in California on 6 October 1966 marked a key turning point in the legal and cultural landscape surrounding hallucinogenic substances in the United States. The decision both reflected and contributed to the growing wariness of the drug's potential risks and the tension between counter-cultural movements and mainstream society at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who revealed her life story to the police? Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat. Now, I have a new situation: John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged. Answer this question please: Which circuit would push lesser amount of charge through the wire, circuit A or circuit B? A:","completion":"To determine which circuit would push a lesser amount of charge through the wire, we can compare the resistance values in Circuit A and Circuit B. We know that Circuit A has adequate resistance while Circuit B has lowered resistance. According to Ohm's Law, Current (I) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R). When resistance decreases, the current increases. Since Circuit A has higher resistance compared to Circuit B, it will push a lesser amount of charge through the wire.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. When receiving a gift of any kind, you should absolutely tell the giver “thank you” for it. \\"Thank you\\" is the best response you can offer no matter what you receive. Expressing thanks demonstrates your desire to accept the gift, compliment, or sentiment while still being humble about it. If simply saying \\"thanks\\" feels awkward to you, follow the phrase with a secondary phrase that continues to express gratitude. Try something like, \\"I appreciate the compliment,\\" or, \\"That's very thoughtful of you.\\" Your nonverbal response is just as important as your verbal response. At minimum, you should receive the vast majority of gifts with a smile. Smiling indicates happiness, and the point of any gift is to make the receiver happy. Smiling when you receive something allows the giver to know that the gift was appreciated, regardless of whether the smile is shy and polite or huge and enthusiastic. Aside from smiling, you should also do things like maintaining eye contact and leaning in toward the giver. Even if you feel uncomfortable, you should avoid crossing your arms, looking away, or appearing disinterested. If you have a hard time receiving, your natural reaction might be to deflect or reject a gift that is offered to you. Doing so is actually more likely to cause a negative reaction than receiving the gift would cause, however. Put yourself into the giver's shoes and think of how it feels when someone denies a compliment or suspiciously rejects a gift. Most people will either be saddened when they realize the receiver doesn't know his or her own value, or frustrated by the implication that the gift or sentiment was somehow dishonest. It is also possible, of course, to seem conceited when you receive something. Failing to express genuine gratitude may make you appear egotistical, which can also cause a negative response from the giver. Appearing egotistical can usually be avoided as long as you stick to the standard “thank you” script. You should still avoid following your thanks with words of self-promotion, though. For instance, if someone compliments your appearance, avoid replying with, “Thanks; I get that all the time,” or, “Thanks; I know.” A fair, appropriate way to demonstrate humility when you receive something like a compliment or a reward is to acknowledge others who put you into a position to receive the gift. For instance, if you receive a compliment about a project that was successfully completed as part of a team effort, tell the giver something along the lines of, \\"The entire team put in a lot of effort, and it wouldn't have been possible without everyone's input. Thank you for acknowledging us.\\" Depending on the situation, it might be socially appropriate to follow up with a more formal thanks or return gift. This principle won't always apply, but following it when convention deems it appropriate can help you feel more comfortable with the gift you received. This is a big issue to consider when receiving gifts for formal occasions, like weddings and baby showers. As you receive the gift in person, a quick “thank you” is appropriate. Later on, you should also follow up with a more formal thank you note acknowledging the gift in greater detail. No matter what the circumstances are, you should never turn the practice of giving into a competition. Giving and receiving are two sides of the same action, and there is no shame in being on either side of that action. This can be especially tempting when receiving compliments. If someone compliments your work, don't return the praise by offering higher praise. For instance, you shouldn't reply with, \\"Thank you, but you could've done a better job.\\" Even if you believe such a statement, it is best to accept the praise without argument.","completion":"When you receive a gift or a compliment, always say \\"thank you\\" and smile to show your appreciation, avoid appearing disinterested or egotistical, and follow up with a more formal thanks if needed, but never turn giving into a competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the relationship between the size, shape, and pitch of musical instruments, while the second question is about the specific instruments used in Sufi music. To answer each question: 1. How do the size and shape of a musical instrument affect the pitch? The size and shape of a musical instrument have a significant impact on the pitch (or frequency) produced by the instrument. To understand this relationship, we must first examine the nature of sound. Sound is a vibration that propagates through a medium (such as air, water, or solids) as a mechanical wave. All musical instruments create sound by generating these vibrations, which, in turn, produce different pitches or frequencies. The size and shape of an instrument influence the pitch it generates in several ways: A. Resonance: Resonance involves the amplification of particular frequencies as they travel within an instrument. Shape plays a vital role in determining resonance, as different shapes will favor specific frequencies while dampening others. For example, the curved body of a violin or guitar can enhance a more expansive, rich sound, whereas a flat, wooden box might produce a less desirable, tinny tone. B. Length: Length is a critical determinant in pitch, specifically for instruments where the musician alters the length to produce different notes, such as the trombone, flute, or stringed instruments. The longer the vibrating portion of the instrument, the lower the frequency (lower pitch) it produces. For example, when a trombonist extends the slide, the instrument lengthens, creating a lower pitch. C. Tension: Tension also plays a role in the pitch produced. This factor is most evident in stringed instruments like guitars or violins, where tighter strings create higher frequencies. The shape and size of the instrument can influence that tension, as well as the musician's ability to manipulate it. D. Material: The type of material an instrument is made from can affect the pitch it produces. Denser materials may carry vibrations more effectively, leading to enhanced resonance and increased richness in the instrument's sound. The size and shape of an instrument, in combination with the materials used in its construction, contribute to the uniqueness of each musical instrument's sonic qualities. 2. What instruments are used in Sufi music? Sufi music is a genre of devotional music with roots in the Islamic mysticism of the Sufi tradition. While Sufi music can vary significantly from region to region, some of the most commonly used instruments in Sufi music include: A. Ney (or Nay): The Ney is a long, end-blown flute made from bamboo or cane, and it is one of the primary wind instruments used in Sufi music. The Ney's melancholic, haunting sound is closely associated with Sufi practices and spiritual realms. B. Daf: The Daf is a large, frame drum typically played with the fingers or a beater. It is used in various Middle Eastern and Central Asian musical traditions, including Sufi music. The Daf often provides the steady pulse or rhythm in Sufi music, and its playing style can range from delicate and subtle to energetic and lively. C. Qawwali: Qawwali is a form of devotional music popular in South Asia, particularly in the Sufi tradition. It is characterized by complex vocal arrangements and prominent use of handclaps and percussion instruments like the tabla (a pair of small drums) and the harmonium (a small keyboard instrument). D. Oud: The Oud is a stringed instrument with a short neck and bulbous body, similar to a lute. Its origins are in the Middle East, and its distinctive sound can be heard in various musical styles, including Sufi music. The Oud often provides melodic and harmonic support in Sufi music and can be used for both accompaniment and solo performances. E. Rabab: The Rabab, also known as the rebab or rubab, is a stringed instrument with roots in Central Asia and the Middle East. It features a skin-covered resonator and sympathetic strings, providing a unique sound that can be heard in Sufi music, particularly across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and North India. These are just a few examples of the diverse range of instruments that can be used in Sufi music. It's important to note that Sufi music is not limited to these instruments exclusively; what defines Sufi music is its spiritual message, lyrical content, and the intention behind the performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags are powered in one of three ways: passive, active, or semi-passive (also known as semi-active or battery-assisted passive) depending on the RFID tag type. 1. Passive tags: These tags do not have an internal power source. Instead, they draw power from the radio frequency (RF) waves emitted by the RFID reader. When the reader sends a radio signal to the tag, the tag's antenna harvests energy from the signal to power the tag's integrated circuit (IC). This IC processes the data stored in the RFID tag's memory and transmits it back to the reader via backscattering. Passive tags are small, lightweight, and typically have a longer lifespan because they have no internal power source to deplete. 2. Active tags: These tags have their own internal power source, typically a battery. This allows them to be read from much greater distances than passive tags, as they can actively transmit their data to the reader rather than relying on backscattering. In addition to RFID applications that require longer read ranges, active tags are sometimes used when environmental factors, such as metallic or liquid surfaces, might interfere with the operation of passive tags. However, they tend to be larger, more expensive, and have a limited lifespan due to the battery. 3. Semi-passive tags: These tags combine elements of both passive and active tags. They have an internal battery that powers the IC, allowing for more sophisticated functions and processing capabilities. However, they still rely on energy harvested from the reader's radio signal to power the communication with the reader. This means they have a longer read range than passive tags but are still limited compared to active tags. They are typically used in applications that require more functionality than passive tags can provide, but with longer lifespans than active tags. As for the answer, \\"Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses,\\" it is correct that RFID technology can be used for tracking pharmaceuticals in warehouses but it doesn't explain how RFID tags are powered. Pharmaceutical tracking with RFID involves placing tags on the products or their packaging, and installing RFID readers throughout the warehouse. As the tagged items move through the facility, the readers detect the tags and update the tracking information in the inventory management system, facilitating the flow of pharmaceutical products and ensuring their security and traceability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is Syra's real name? is inside the article: The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome. After some dramatic events that reveal his surprising connections to Syra, who is his long-lost younger sister Myriam, Fulvius rejects his evil ways, converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"From the given article, it is evident that Syra's real name is Myriam. She is a secret Christian and a slave girl who belongs to Fabiola, the story's protagonist. Syra's strong sense of humility, maturity, and devotion even when attacked and wounded by her mistress, Fabiola, is instrumental in the latter's transformation. Syra's connection to Fulvius, another character in the story, adds another layer to her character as it is revealed that she is his long-lost younger sister. Ultimately, Syra's influence transcends her role as a slave girl in the grand narrative, significantly impacting the lives of both Fabiola and Fulvius, ultimately leading them to embrace Christianity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prin urmare, o politică de coeziune puternică, acesta fiind un element esențial în acest demers, trebuie să fie finanțată în mod adecvat și să acopere fiecare regiune europeană, pentru a contribui la implementarea obiectivelor stabilite la nivel comunitar. În primul rând, o astfel de politică ar putea contribui la reducerea disparităților regionale și la stimularea convergenței economice și sociale dintre diferitele regiuni europene. Acest lucru este important în contextul unei Uniuni Europene în continuă extindere și diversificare, care grupează țări cu niveluri variate de dezvoltare și cu nevoi specifice în materie de investiții și sprijin. În al doilea rând, o politică de coeziune solidă și bine finanțată poate susține acumularea de capital uman și dezvoltarea infrastructurii necesare creșterii durabile și incluzive. De exemplu, investițiile în educație, formare profesională și cercetare pot contribui la creșterea nivelului de cunoștințe și competențe al populației, în timp ce investițiile în infrastructura de transport, energie și comunicații pot facilita dezvoltarea întreprinderilor și a economiei locale. În al treilea rând, o politică de coeziune adecvată poate aborda problemele legate de protecția mediului și lupta împotriva schimbărilor climatice. Prin promovarea proiectelor ecologice, a eficienței energetice și a utilizării surselor regenerabile de energie, politica de coeziune poate contribui la tranziția către o economie verde și la realizarea obiectivului de descărcare de carbon al Uniunii Europene. În sfârșit, o politică de coeziune puternică ar putea facilita colaborarea transfrontalieră, interregională și intersectorială, precum și schimbul de experiență și bune practici între diferitele regiuni europene. Aceasta ar putea duce la o mai bună coordonare a politicilor și instrumentelor financiare în contextul construirii unei Europe mai unite, competitive și inclusive. În concluzie, o politică de coeziune solidă, finanțată corespunzător și care acoperă fiecare regiune europeană, reprezintă un element fundamental în Strategia Europa 2020 și poate juca un rol esențial în promovarea creșterii și a incluziunii sociale în întreaga Uniune Europeană."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They want to know how to learn trigonometric formulas using something called Euler's formula. Let me explain it for you in a simple way. Euler's formula is a special math idea that uses something called imaginary numbers. It has an easy-to-remember form: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x). Here, \\"e\\" is a special number, \\"i\\" is an imaginary number, and \\"x\\" is the angle we are looking at. Euler's formula connects trigonometric formulas like cosine and sine, which you might know from things like triangles, with these imaginary numbers. By using Euler's formula, we can make learning trigonometric formulas a bit easier because it turns some complicated stuff into simpler stuff.

Summarize this article: Select 3 small 1-way valves used for bicycle tires and pick out a hot knife with a tip that matches the size of the valves. Also, get a 50-60mL needleless syringe and 12 inches (30 cm) or so of plastic tubing that matches the size of the valve. Some valves are 6 millimeters while others are 8 millimeters. Either kind is fine, but your plastic tubing should match. Find these syringes at most drug stores. Pick the kind that doesn't have a needle coming out. Look for hot knives at craft stores or home improvement stores. Change the tip on the hot knife to the round tip that's the same size as your valves. Plug the knife in to heat up. Gently pull the plunger back on the syringe about 1 inch (2.5 cm). When the knife is hot, plunge it into the side of the syringe, making a hole in the space you've created by moving the plunger. The exact spot doesn't matter, but place it closer to the tip edge of the syringe than the plunger end. Try to keep the hole as small as possible, as you want the valve to fit in the syringe tightly. Unscrew the black cap off the top of the valve. Turn the threaded part of the valve into the hole. Keep turning it to the right (clockwise) until the valve is as far as it will go in the hole. You'll still have the top part of the valve sticking out of the syringe. At this point, it can help to squeeze a little superglue around the valve, as that will help seal the pump. The length doesn't need to be exact. After you cut it, wedge it onto the tip of the syringe so it fits over it tightly. It can help to add a dollop of superglue around the edges to keep it in place. Push it in as far as it will go. It will eventually hit the lip, and when it does, stop there. You may need to use pliers to help work the valve into the tubing. Some people skip the tubing altogether and just press the valve into the end of the syringe's tip. You can test both options to see which works best for you. Use any length of tubing but make sure it's long enough to reach your pressure chamber. Once it's threaded onto the tubing, attach it to a valve on your pressure chamber to complete the pump. A simple way to make a pressure chamber for your vacuum pump is to drill a hole on the top of a canning jar and insert a bicycle valve thread-side down into the hole. Seal the edges with silicone gel or superglue. To use the vacuum, start with the plunger of the syringe nearly all the way in and then pull it out to the end of the syringe to create a vacuum.","completion":"This article describes the process of creating a small vacuum pump with a syringe, bicycle tire valves, and plastic tubing.

SWAT officers shot and killed Vargas after he killed six people in an apartment building in Hialeah, just a few miles north of Miami, ending an hours-long standoff early Saturday, Hialeah Police said. Officials identified the victims as Italo Pisciotti, 79, Camira Pisciotti, 69, Carlos Javier Gavilanes, 33, Patricio Simono, 64, Merly S. Niebles, 51, and a 17-year-old female. \\"I'm torn apart by all this,\\" Hialeah mayor Carlos Hernandez said Saturday.

(Published Saturday, July 27, 2013) Fire rescue crews were first called to the scene at about 6:30 p.m. after Vargas lit apartment 408 where he lived at 1485 West 46th Street on fire with some sort of combustible liquid, Zogby said Saturday. Officials confirmed Vargas started the fire by burning 10,000 cash and his mother was in the apartment complex at the time of the fire. The mother was able to get out to safety, but it is not clear how, according to authorities. Building managers Italo Pisciotti and Camira Pisciotti ran towards the apartment when they noticed smoke was coming out of it and Vargas came out the door, shooting and killing both of them at the scene, Zogby said. Hialeah Shooting Suspect and 6 Victims Dead After Hostage Standoff SWAT officers shot and killed a suspect after he killed six people in an Hialeah apartment building, ending an hours-long standoff early Saturday, Hialeah Police spokesman Carl Zogby said. NBC 6's Bobby Brooks has the latest. (Published Saturday, July 27, 2013) Vargas (pictured right) then ran back into the burning apartment, walked out onto his balcony and fired 10 to 20 shots into the street, killing Gavilanes who was at the apartment building across the street, according to Zogby. He said Gavilanes, a father, had just arrived home from work and was standing in the parking lot next to his car when he was killed. Vargas then ran out of the apartment building, firing shots at random in an irrational fashion, Zogby said. Police officers had already arrived on scene and fired at him as he fired back in the hallway. He then entered another apartment where he took two hostages at gunpoint, Zogby said. Negotiators were talking with Vargas, and police sent a robot into the scene, authorities said. But after police discovered that six people were dead, and that the man had two hostages in an apartment, the SWAT unit decided there was no more time to negotiate, Zogby said. About eight hours after the situation began, a SWAT team entered the apartment, killing Vargas and saving the two hostages. \\"The end result: seven people have lost their lives in this incident, six innocent victims and the one shooter,\\" Zogby said. \\"Now starts the investigation, how and why this happened.” VIDEO: Police Respond to Active Shooter Scene in Hialeah Zogby said the hostages, identified as Zoeb Nek and Sarrida Nek, were not hurt, and he did not believe that any officers were injured. He said Vargas still had several rounds of live ammunition left when police intervened. Officials said he used a 9mm pistol during the rampage. \\"Had we not cornered him and then entered and engaged him, this could have been a much greater tragedy,\\" Zogby said. Hialeah Police told NBC News that Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. Shamira Pisciotti said she found her parents, Italo and Samira Pisciotti, after hearing the shots. She ran over to them and found her mother dead and her father clinging to life. \\"I guess there was an altercation and the person opened fire on both of them. My mom was dead the moment that she was shot and my dad still had a pulse when I got to him,\\" Shamira Pisciotti said. He died soon after, she said. Merly Niebles and husband Patricio Simono, along with Niebles' daughter, were found in one of the apartments, Hialeah police spokesman Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez told NBC News. Agustin Hernandez and Alberto Martinez confirmed Niebles' daughter's name was Priscilla Perez (pictured below). Hernandez and Martinez, who are married to Niebles' sisters, said Patricio was a handyman at the apartment complex and worked with the building managers. American Christian School principal Sergio Chavarri said Perez was a student at his school and would have gone into 11th grade this year. Perez, who wanted to be a nurse, never missed one day of class in the four years that she attended the school which takes pre-K through high school students, he said. \\"She was a very nice person,\\" Chavarri said. \\"We can't believe that such a nice person should be, you know, something like that.\\" Shamira Pisciotti said she believed that there was a complaint about the shooter and that he confronted her parents about it, and that he then shot them. She said she heard about 15 to 20 gunshots. Several other witnesses said they heard between 10 and 12 shots. VIDEO: Daughter of Hialeah Shooting Victim Talks About Finding Her Parents Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes, and a couple of streets in the area were shut down. Claribel Dominguez said she believes she was one of the last people to see her friend Samina Pisciotti alive. She shared that news with Pisciotti's grieving family. “But I was just with her mom before it happened, like 15 or 20 minutes ago before it happened we were at Kmart,” Dominguez said. She said that she heard several shots from inside the store, a few blocks away from the scene.

They made their vows a month ago, but Tamara Ecclestone and new husband Jay Rutland could hardly have expected them to be tested so soon. Barely three days after they arrived back in London after an extended honeymoon, Mr Rutland was robbed at knifepoint. Two men in hoodies allegedly stole Jay Rutland's £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet as he relieved himself in bushes. Honeymoon's over: Tamara Ecclestone and her husband Jay Rutland at Ilford Police Station. The self-styled ‘international playboy’ was left battered and bruised in the attack, which happened in a side street near a garage. Two men in hoodies stole his £50,000 Rolex watch and a £20,000 gold bracelet. Mr Rutland, 32, said he was driving home alone from a friend’s house shortly after midnight on Wednesday when his fuel gauge started flashing, so he stopped for petrol at a garage off the A12 in Wanstead, East London. He had gone to relieve himself in some bushes in a secluded corner when he was approached by two men who he claims threatened him before assaulting and robbing him. One produced a knife and demanded cash and valuables, then Mr Rutland was hit in the face and knocked to the ground. During the scuffle one of the attackers dropped his phone. Mr Rutland picked it up and later handed it to police, which helped identify the man. Three people from the petrol station came to help Mr Rutland when they heard his screams and shouts. A close friend of Mr Rutland said: ‘It was a fairly vicious attack and Jay did sustain some mild injuries. He is very bruised and shaken.’ He had cuts to his face and a black eye when he arrived at Ilford police station the day after the robbery, accompanied by 29-year-old Miss Ecclestone. On the night of the attack it is believed. Rutland was driving his £100,000 customised Range Rover, which has his. name emblazoned across the bonnet. Mr Rutland married Miss Ecclestone, the socialite daughter of billionaire Formula One boss Bernie, at a lavish £7million celebration in Cannes last month. Three people from the petrol station came to help Mr Rutland when they heard his screams. Residents who live near the garage said the area was not known for crime and they were shocked at the robbery. One said: ‘I can’t believe something like that would happen. Especially at the garage and on such a busy road. We didn’t hear anything, and it was just a normal night.’ Mr Rutland married Miss Ecclestone, the socialite daughter of billionaire Formula One boss Bernie, at a lavish £7million celebration in Cannes last month. The couple have spent the weeks since enjoying a string of holidays, first on the French Riviera and then to the Italian island of Capri. After their wedding, the couple have spent the weeks since enjoying a string of holidays.

Answer the question below: If current increases, that means resistance is increasing or decreasing? Assuming that: When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases. The answer to this question is:","completion":"If the current increases, it typically means that the resistance is decreasing in an electrical circuit, according to Ohm's Law. Let's dive deeper into the relationship between current, resistance, and voltage to understand this concept further. Ohm's Law is a vital principle in electrical engineering that states the relationship between current (I), voltage (V), and resistance (R) in a circuit. The formula for Ohm's Law is given as: V = I × R Here, V represents voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. From the formula, we can deduce that the relationship between current and resistance is inversely proportional when voltage is kept constant in a circuit. Now, let's consider the scenario you provided - when we add resistors in parallel to each other, the total resistance decreases, and the current increases. In a parallel circuit, resistors can be combined in such a way that the reciprocal of the total resistance (1/R_total) is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances (1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ...). Mathematically, this can be expressed as: 1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ... By adding resistors in parallel, the total effective resistance of the circuit decreases. This results in a higher current flow through the circuit for a given voltage, as per Ohm's Law, which states that the current is directly proportional to the voltage, given a constant resistance. Alternatively, we can also conclude that if the current increases, the resistance must be decreasing, keeping the voltage constant. This is because, as per Ohm's Law, the product of current and resistance should equal the voltage, which remains constant in this case. Hence, when the current increases, the resistance must decrease to maintain this equality. In summary, if the current increases in a circuit, it means that the resistance is decreasing, given that the voltage remains constant. This concept is demonstrated through Ohm's Law and the behavior of resistors in parallel circuits. Moreover, it is essential to remember that these relationships and principles apply under the assumption that voltage remains constant throughout the circuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hu is the only person in China, and only one of ten people worldwide who suffer from a rare condition called Cutis laxa, which has caused her to age prematurely. Scroll down for video. Hu Juan (pictured left earlier in her twenties and right at 28) suffers from a rare disease called Cutis laxa which has made her face age dramatically. The 28-year-old - who looks more like someone in her 60s or 70s - first noticed the changes after she gave birth to her first child 11 years ago, Shanghaiist reported. The condition means the skin on her face and neck has lost its elasticity, causing it to become loose and sag. It does not affect any other areas of her body, and there is no known treatment or cause for the rare disease. The disorder has previously plunged her into a deep depression and she once attempted to take her own life. Hu will not look in the mirror and often refuses to leave the house. Having a second child did nothing to change the condition of her face, as she hoped it may. The woman first developed the disorder after the birth of her first child 11 years ago, and is now seeking cosmetic surgery to try and reverse the effects. The mother of two also said Cutis laxa has caused a rift between her and her eldest son, as he is ashamed she looks so old.

Leadership is as much a question of timing as anything else. The leader must appear on the scene at a moment when people are looking for leadership. And when he comes, he must offer a straightforward and powerful message. Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers who cut through argument, debate and doubt to offer a solution everybody can understand and remember. We have an image of what a leader ought to be. We even recognize the physical signs: leaders may not necessarily be tall, but they must have bigger- than-life, commanding features. We expect our leaders to stand out a little, not to be like ordinary men. Half of President Ford's trouble lay in the fact that, if you closed your eyes for a moment, you couldn't remember his face, figure, or clothes. It also helps for a leader to be able to do something most of us can't. Mao swam the Yangtze River at the age of 72. We want our leaders to be like us but better, special, more so. Yet if they are too different, we reject them. A leader must know how to use power (that's what leadership is about), but he also has to have a way of showing that he does. A leader should know how to appear relaxed and confident. His walk should be firm and purposeful. He should be able to give a good, hearty, belly laugh. Ronald Reagan's career as an actor showed to good effect in the debate with his opponent. He managed to convey the impression that in fact he was the President. A leader rides the waves, moves with the tides, understands the deepest feelings of his people. He cannot make a nation that wants peace at any price go to war, or stop a nation determined to fight from doing so. His purpose must match the national mood. His task is to focus the people's energies and desires, to inspire, to make what people already want seem possible and important to achieve.

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of 151 metres (495 ft) near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities.

David wanted to test the theory of Einstein. To that end, he measured the time perceived by an airline pilot, who naturally traveled very fast. He labeled it as case A. To compare the pilot with a slower traveler he measured the time perceived by a semi truck driver covering the same distance. He labeled it as case B. He was amazed by the counter intuitive results he got from the experiment. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: According to Einstein, would case B perceive the distance shorter or longer than case A?","completion":"According to Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, time dilation occurs when an observer is in motion relative to another observer. In this context, the faster an object moves, the slower time appears to pass for that object as observed by a stationary observer. In David's experiment, case A represents the airline pilot who is traveling very fast while case B represents the semi truck driver who is traveling at a slower speed. Since the airline pilot (case A) is moving faster than the semi truck driver (case B), the time dilation effect would be more pronounced for the pilot according to Special Relativity. Now, let's address the question about the perceived distance. According to the length contraction phenomenon, which is another aspect of Special Relativity, the faster an object is moving relative to a stationary observer, the shorter the distance appears to the moving observer. In this case, the airline pilot (case A) is moving faster than the semi-truck driver (case B) relative to a stationary observer, so case A would perceive the distance as being shorter. Therefore, case B (the semi-truck driver) would perceive the distance as being longer compared to case A (the airline pilot)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These infants were too young to be vaccinated, and as a result they were particularly susceptible. So we vaccinated those around them to stop transmission. By 2000, a decade after my EIS experience, measles transmission in the United States was declared to have been stopped. However, we still have occasional clusters of measles in pockets of unvaccinated children after measles has been brought into the United States from somewhere else in the world. In response to these clusters, public health officials have been tirelessly working to ensure that communities are well-informed about the risks of measles and the importance of vaccinations. This has involved partnering with healthcare providers, schools, and community organizations to spread awareness and educate parents about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Outreach programs in various languages have been developed, targeting specific populations to bridge any gaps in communication and understanding. One of the main challenges faced by health officials is the spread of misinformation and myths about vaccines, which have fueled some parents' hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Combating this misinformation requires a multifaceted approach, including debunking myths through educational materials and social media campaigns, and promoting reputable sources of information, such as CDC's website and healthcare professionals, as reliable authorities on the subject. In addition to awareness campaigns and educational outreach, improving access to vaccines is a key component in preventing future measles outbreaks. This includes ensuring that vaccines are readily available to all children, regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographical location. Initiatives like the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides free vaccines to eligible children, help reduce financial barriers for families who may otherwise struggle to afford vaccinations. Monitoring and maintaining high vaccination rates is crucial for maintaining herd immunity, which protects individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to age, medical conditions, or other reasons. Healthcare providers play an important role in tracking vaccination records and following up with families to ensure that children receive the appropriate vaccines on schedule. In some cases, public health officials may also implement targeted vaccination drives in communities where vaccination rates are low. Lastly, international collaboration and cooperation plays a vital role in preventing the spread of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. By sharing epidemiological data, surveillance techniques, and best practices in vaccination campaigns, countries can work together to prevent outbreaks from crossing borders and ensure a rapid response when cases do emerge. In conclusion, the most logical way to complete this passage would be to emphasize the importance of continued public health efforts to promote vaccination, combat misinformation, and improve access to vaccines. Additionally, maintaining high vaccination rates, monitoring vaccination records, and fostering international collaboration are all essential strategies for preventing future measles outbreaks. By working together, communities, healthcare providers, and public health officials can ensure that measles remains a rare and controlled disease in the United States and around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the last name of the person whose father was determined that his sons would not work in the mines? Answer the above question based on the context below: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college. Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, \\"for...

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The question appears to be mixing two different concepts: the process of solution cave formation in limestone, and the influence of chewing food more on salt removal from water. These two processes are not directly related, so it is challenging to answer the question based on the provided information. However, I will address both concepts separately. 1. Solution caves in limestone: The process you described is accurate in explaining how solution caves are formed in limestone rocks. The weak carbonic acid solution formed from rainwater infiltrating into the soil reacts with the calcite in limestone, dissolving it and gradually forming caves and passageways. 2. Chewing food more and its effect on salt removal from water: Chewing food more has no direct impact on removing salt from water. Chewing food thoroughly can aid in the digestion process, as it breaks down the food into smaller particles, allowing the body to extract nutrients more efficiently. However, this process is unrelated to the removal of salt from water. In conclusion, the perturbation of chewing food more in the mouth has no effect on salt removal from water, nor does it influence the process of solution cave formation in limestone.

Let's compute the result: result = 0 result += 8 * (6^0) = 8 * 1 = 8 result += 5 * (6^1) = 5 * 6 = 30 result += 3 * (6^2) = 3 * 36 = 108 result += 6 * (6^3) = 6 * 216 = 1296 result += 2 * (6^4) = 2 * 1296 = 2592 result = 8 + 30 + 108 + 1296 + 2592 = 4034 So, the result of the polynomial expression with x = 6 and equation weights = [8, 5, 3, 6, 2] is 4034."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the town were people moved after Elcor's land prices skyrocketed? from the following article ? In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik.

Movie title: Buppah Rahtree Movie plot: Buppah Rahtree is a loner female student at a Bangkok university who becomes the object of a wager by a group of male students to see if she can be bedded. Ake, the son of a wealthy family, takes the bet and courts young Buppah. She resists him at first, but one day sees him feeding pigeons in a park and talks to him. After she expresses her desire to fly away, they go on a ride in Ake's convertible. They continue to have a relationship, which culminates in a three-day weekend at Bang Saen, during which Ake has sex with her; he stays in bed with her the whole time. Ake shows videotapes of their sex to his friends, and for his efforts wins a bottle of Johnnie Walker, which he reflects to himself seems like a trivial prize for messing up another person's life. Ake breaks off all contact with Buppah. After her stepfather gives her a car ride, he takes her to a short-time hotel and sexually assaults her. She stabs him with a fountain pen he gaver her as a present and runs home to her apartment. Depressed, she contemplates suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from Ake, who wants to meet her. Ake tells her about the wager and apologizes. Though he plans to leave Thailand to study in England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. Buppah informs Ake she is two months' pregnant. Ake's mother tells him to convince Buppah to have an abortion. After the operation, he drives her back to her apartment, and it is obvious she is in pain. Ake leaves to get rice congee but does not return. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect rent, Buppah's landlady breaks into the apartment, where she discovers Buppah's corpse; Buppah bled to death due to complications from the abortion. When the authorities arrive, Buppah revives, and her vengeful spirit refuses to be dislodged. Mrs. See calls upon Maew, a false shaman who hustles locals, to exorcise the spirit.

A:","completion":"Buppah Rahtree is a character from a Thai film directed by Yuthlert Sippapak. The movie, titled \\"Buppah Rahtree,\\" is a mix of horror, comedy, and romance. Buppah is a lonely female student at a university in Bangkok. She becomes the center of attention when a group of male students start a wager on whether they can get her to sleep with them. Ake, a wealthy young man, takes up the challenge and begins to pursue her romantically. Initially, Buppah resists Ake's advances but ultimately starts to develop feelings for him. This leads to their relationship intensifying and culminating in an intimate weekend getaway. However, Ake betrays Buppah when he shares the secret videotapes of their intimate moments with his friends to fulfill the wager. This act is particularly hurtful to her as it leads to the end of their relationship and tarnishes her trust. Unfortunately, Buppah faces further hardship when her stepfather sexually assaults her. In self-defense, she stabs him with a fountain pen, given to her by him as a gift, before running back to her apartment. The series of events drives Buppah into depression and pushes her to contemplate suicide. Meanwhile, Ake realizes his mistake and apologizes to Buppah while informing her about the bet. Although he plans to leave for England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. However, things take a turn when Buppah reveals she is pregnant. Ake's mother urges him to convince Buppah to have an abortion, which leads to her having complications and ultimately dying from excessive bleeding. Despite her death, her vengeful spirit refuses to leave her apartment. The landlady then seeks help from various spiritual practitioners, including a fake shaman named Maew and his teacher Master Tong, both of whom fail in their attempts. Lastly, a pair of Roman Catholic priests tries to exorcise her spirit.

There are no dance schools in Glenwood and Lauryn says goodbye to her brother, Joel (John Reardon) before departing for Chicago to audition for a famous dance school, the fictional Chicago School of Music and Dance. Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance. The next night, Brenda finds herself short of dancers. Russ asks Lauryn to dance, after having seen her graceful performance the previous night. Lauryn reluctantly agrees, and goes on stage. At first, new to the sexy routine, Lauryn looks foolish, but when Russ starts playing hip-hop music, Lauryn does a sexy hip-hop routine, and finds herself to be Ruby's new star.

A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).

Incorrect options: (ii) The sentence begins with a negative assumption that if they say no, it implies that the person should not be upset or give the silent treatment. Although understanding parents' perspectives is important, this answer doesn't fit as a next sentence following the topic of requesting permission. (iii) This answer focuses on possible negative reactions from parents and suggests not getting upset, but it does not provide a useful tip or step for convincing the parents to let someone stay home from school.

Charlie's friend, novelist Paul Essex, dies aboard the aircraft after receiving a radiogram warning him not to ignore \\"Zodiac\\". His briefcase mysteriously disappears. Charlie meets with Deputy Police Chief J.J. Kilvaine, and runs into reporter and old friend Peter Lewis. Charlie also meets noted local magician Fred Rhadini, and discusses Essex's death with the three men. Rhadini tells Charlie about Dr. Zodiac, a psychic preying on the rich in San Francisco. Charlie, Rhadini, and Lewis go to Dr. Zodiac's home, where Dr. Zodiac conducts an eerie séance. Lewis' fiancée, Eve Cairo, has been meeting with Dr. Zodiac, angering Lewis. Later, Kilvaine reveals that Essex was poisoned, but can't rule out suicide. Jimmy spends the afternoon following Thomas Gregory, whom he believes stole Essex's briefcase when leaving the plane.

They always enjoyed the same hobbies and did everything together. When puberty hit, Jeff was growing much taller than Jeremy. Jeremy's parents were worried about him because he was not growing and was the shortest boy in their class so they took him to the doctor to have his hormones tested. The boys wanted to play a team sport together and had to choose between basketball and soccer. and a hint : Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. Please answer this question : Which sport would Jeremy play better do to his size, basketball or soccer?","completion":"Based on Jeremy's size and the information provided, soccer would likely be a better fit for him compared to basketball. In basketball, height can be a significant advantage, as taller players can more easily block shots, grab rebounds, and shoot over defenders. On the other hand, soccer emphasizes skills such as speed, agility, and ball control, which are not necessarily dependent on height. Although taller players might have some advantages in certain aspects of soccer, such as winning aerial duels, shorter players can still excel in this sport by focusing on their strengths, such as dribbling and quick changes of direction.

How do I satisfy a girl during sex?","completion":"While the two questions might seem identical at first glance, they actually possess subtle differences in their meanings and implications. By examining their context, scope, and emphasis, we can better understand the nuances between the two questions. 1. \\"How do I satisfy the girl during sex?\\" This question implies that the person asking has a specific girl in mind that they are either currently in or anticipate being in a sexual relationship with. The question displays a desire to satisfy this particular girl and ensure that she experiences pleasure and enjoyment during the act. It may also suggest that the person asking is either unsure of or seeks to improve their sexual prowess for the sake of their partner. 2. \\"How do I satisfy a girl during sex?\\" Unlike the first question, this one has broader implications as it pertains to satisfying any girl during sex, rather than focusing on a specific person. The person asking may be seeking general advice and strategies to employ in various sexual encounters, regardless of the relationship they have with the girl involved. It could also indicate a more inexperienced individual trying to gather information before entering into the realm of sexual relationships. Now, let's offer a detailed and thoughtful response addressing both questions, keeping in mind their unique nuances: To satisfy both the girl or a girl during sex, you should consider the following: 1. Communication: Open lines of communication are vital for understanding and catering to your partner's desires and needs. Discuss sexual preferences, boundaries, and what may or may not feel good. 2. Consent: Always ensure you have your partner's consent and make respect and trust the foundation of your sexual encounters. 3. Foreplay: Being attentive during foreplay is an effective way of tending to your partner's physical and emotional needs. Focus on gentle touches, kisses, caresses, and massages to help build anticipation. 4. Be attentive to her body language: Pay close attention to nonverbal cues, such as her breathing, movements, and vocal expressions, which can indicate if she is enjoying herself or if you should alter your approach. 5. Sexual techniques: Learn various sexual techniques and positions, ensuring that those practiced are pleasurable for your partner. Be open to trying new things, keeping in mind your partner's comfort and preferences. 6. Emotional connection: Going beyond physical signals, maintain an emotional connection with your partner to enhance intimacy. This can create a more satisfying sexual experience for both parties. 7. Aftercare: A satisfying sexual experience extends beyond the act itself. Ensure you tend to your partner's emotional well-being afterward by cuddling, conversing, or demonstrating affectionate gestures. Ultimately, the key to satisfying a partner in any sexual endeavor lies in open communication, respect, and understanding individual needs and preferences. While the two questions mentioned earlier hold nuances in scope and context, the general approach to fulfilling the desires of a specific girl or any girl, should follow these principles."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving dinosaurs, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs. Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period. Many of these early \\"stem-birds\\", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.

Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings.

During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\".

The answer is:","completion":"Elfenland was released first. To provide a detailed and thorough answer, let's look at the history and features of both board games. 1. Elfenland: Elfenland is a board game designed by Alan R. Moon and was first published in 1998 by Amigo Spiele, a German game manufacturer. The game revolves around the fantasy world of Elfenland, where players take on the roles of elf characters completing their journeys through the kingdom. The objective for each player is to successfully visit as many cities as possible, and to do so, players must strategically plan and navigate their way through the board using a multitude of transportation methods such as dragons, unicorns, and magic clouds. Elfenland is played on a map containing cities that are connected by various routes, with each route allowing a specific type of transportation. Throughout the game, players have to collect transportation cards and tokens, enabling them to traverse the different landscapes like forests, deserts, rivers, and mountains. The skillful use of these transport options and the strategic planning of one's path are essential to succeed in the game. Elfenland has received several awards, including the prestigious Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) in 1998. 2. Stonehenge: Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game, on the other hand, was designed by a collaboration of famous board game designers such as Richard Garfield, Richard Borg, James Ernest, Bruno Faidutti, and Alan R. Moon. It was first published in 2007 by Paizo Publishing, an American company. Stonehenge is unique, as it is an anthology game, consisting of five distinct, independent games that can be played using the same set of components. Each game was designed by one of the contributing designers and varies in genre, from racing to political influence to dexterity. The Stonehenge game board itself is inspired by the iconic prehistoric monument found in England, with the board depicting a circular layout divided into five concentric rings, each assigned with different numerical values. This design allows for a high level of versatility and varied game experiences. In summary, given the release dates of both board games, Elfenland was released first in 1998, almost a decade before Stonehenge, which was introduced in 2007. While both games offer imaginative and engaging gameplay, Elfenland holds the distinction of being released earlier and earning the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elizabeth Short (July 29, 1924 - January 14 or 15, 1947), known posthumously as \\"the Black Dahlia\\", was an American woman who was found murdered in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which entailed her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist. A native of Boston, Short had spent her early life in Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. On the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body was found severed in two pieces on a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at 34.0164degN 118.333degW / 34.0164; -118.333) in Leimert Park, Los Angeles. At the time, the neighborhood was largely undeveloped. Local resident Betty Bersinger discovered the body at approximately 10:00 a.m. while she was walking with her three-year-old daughter. Bersinger initially thought she had found a discarded store mannequin. When she realized it was a corpse, she rushed to a nearby house and telephoned the police. Short's severely mutilated body was completely severed at the waist and drained entirely of blood, leaving its skin a pallid white. Medical examiners determined that she had been dead for around ten hours prior to the discovery, leaving her time of death either sometime during the evening of January 14, or the early morning hours of January 15.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. Question: What bad effect does being busy bring? Options: - Feeling important and productive - not enough information - Success in your field - Self-neglect === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is 'Self-neglect'. A busy, frenetic lifestyle often leads to self-neglect due to the constant drive to take on more challenges and the ongoing stream of urgent tasks. This state of continuous pushing, rushing, and fulfilling responsibilities often overshadows the less immediate but critical needs of one's life, creating a pervasive, harmful impact on various aspects of life, specifically physical, mental, and emotional well-being. When individuals become excessively busy, crucial elements of daily life, such as a balanced diet, sleep, relaxation, and self-care, often become secondary, leading to their neglect. One common example is the diet; constant busyness can render people unable to prepare nutritious meals, pushing them toward convenience foods, frozen meals, take-outs, and fast food. Such eating habits are associated with a plethora of health issues as these foods are typically high in additives, sugars, fats, and empty calories and offer minimal nutritional value. Moreover, consistent hurriedness and busyness also lead to disruptive sleep patterns and limited spare time for relaxation or deep breaths. This lack of rest and relaxation can cumulatively result in a heightened level of stress, anxiety, and various other health implications, creating a vicious cycle of self-neglect. The mental and emotional well-being of individuals can also suffer significantly. With zero or limited time devoted to self-care and relaxation, they may start to lose sight of their initial success intentions, leading to diminished overall life satisfaction. Consequently, the perceived sense of accomplishment and importance that comes from being perpetually busy may soon be outweighed by the negative effects of self-neglect on overall life quality and enjoyment. Therefore, while it might initially seem that being busy results in feelings of importance and productivity, the long-term effects can lead to the manifestation of self-neglect at various levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He leads his gang into robbing and torturing a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks. Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobsâthe front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed bodega at night. It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep. Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a transgender woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries. Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps. Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money. Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night. When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, and Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors.

Whenever you have a new tenant, make it a point to sit down with them and go through the lease in detail. Do your part to make sure they understand everything in it before they sign on the dotted line.","completion":"Being a good landlord involves more than just explaining the lease to new tenants. It also means maintaining a professional relationship with them, taking care of the property, and nurturing a sense of community among your tenants. Below are some additional pointers on how to be a good landlord: 1. Be responsive and approachable: Make sure your tenants feel comfortable reaching out to you with questions or concerns. Respond promptly to any inquiries, be it via phone, email, or in-person visits. This helps to establish trust – your tenants will appreciate knowing they can rely on you when needed. 2. Set clear expectations: Clearly state your expectations regarding rent payments, maintenance, and adhering to the terms of the lease. Ensure that everyone understands their responsibilities to prevent misunderstandings down the line. It's essential to be consistent in enforcing the rules, but also be willing to offer leniency under exceptional circumstances. 3. Carry out regular maintenance and repairs: Proactively maintain your rental property by performing routine checks and addressing any issues promptly. This could involve tasks like painting, fixing broken appliances, and landscaping. By doing so, you not only preserve the value of your investment but also demonstrate your commitment to providing your tenants with a comfortable living environment. 4. Respect your tenants' privacy: As a landlord, it's crucial to respect the privacy of your tenants. Avoid making unannounced visits, and always provide a reasonable notice before entering their living space, unless there is an emergency. By doing this, you can maintain a professional relationship and show respect for their boundaries. 5. Screen your tenants: Conduct a thorough background check and gather references from potential tenants. This helps you to identify responsible individuals who are likely to pay rent on time, take good care of the property, and comply with all terms of the lease. This can save you from potential headaches and the hassle of dealing with problematic tenants. 6. Promote a sense of community: Foster a sense of unity and belonging among tenants by hosting community events like BBQs, holiday parties, or yard sales. This can create a positive atmosphere and encourage tenants to communicate with each other and address issues as a group. Happy tenants are more likely to stay long-term and recommend your rentals to others. 7. Stay up-to-date on local laws and regulations: Familiarize yourself with local rental laws and property management regulations to ensure you are in compliance. Failure to do so may result in penalties and legal disputes that could've been easily avoided. 8. Be open to negotiation: While it's essential to stay firm on certain rules and regulations, being flexible and open to negotiation on smaller matters can contribute to a positive landlord-tenant relationship. For example, allowing a tenant to have a pet or to repaint a room might just strengthen your relationship and increase the chances of retaining reliable tenants. 9. Keep accurate records: Document all transactions and communications with your tenants, such as rental payments, maintenance requests, and notices. This will help in case of disputes or legal issues and serve as a reminder of agreed-upon terms. Good record-keeping is also essential for tax purposes. 10. Act fairly and be empathetic: Treat all your tenants equally, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or any other factors. Strive to understand their unique situations and be open to finding resolutions that are fair and reasonable. By being a fair and compassionate landlord, you encourage an environment of respect and understanding that can lead to long-lasting and successful tenancies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Three divisions were employed: Pskov division , International Division , and 17th Division . The divisions did not have a common military commander. Later more units were sent from Russia. The soviets also recruited partisan groups behind the front lines. Soviet soldiers were poorly supplied and had to support themselves by requisitioning food, horses, and clothes from local residents. Lithuania could not offer serious resistance as at the time its army consisted only of about 3,000 untrained volunteers. Only local partisans, armed with weapons acquired from retreating Germans, offered brief resistance. Red Army captured one town after another: Zarasai and Švenčionys , Utena , Rokiškis , Vilnius , Ukmergė and Panevėžys , Šiauliai , Telšiai . That accounted for about ⅔ of the Lithuanian territory. The front somewhat stabilized when Soviet forces were stopped near the Venta River by Latvian and German units . Also Germans slowed down withdrawal of their troops after the Spartacist uprising was subdued on January 12. Southern Lithuania was a little better protected as Germans retreated from Ukraine through Hrodna. To prevent fights between retreating Germans and the Red Army, the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty on January 18. The treaty drew a temporary demarcation line that went through Daugai, Stakliškės, and 10 kilometres east of Kaišiadorys-Jonava-Kėdainiai railway. That barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to encircle Kaunas and attack through Alytus or Kėdainiai.

He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia. During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers. While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did he do anything significant due to his orientation?","completion":"Little Richard did many things due to his orientation that were significant. He wore makeup, like Pancake 31, and had his band members wear makeup too, so they could enter white clubs while performing. He said, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" Little Richard used his orientation to stand out and become famous, saying \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" So, his orientation influenced his appearance, performances, and how he became a famous musician."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: when was anyone who knows what love is made?","completion":"\\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" is a song written by Jeannie Seely, Randy Newman, Judith Arbuckle, and Pat Sheeran. It was first recorded and released in 1964 by the American soul singer Irma Thomas. Irma Thomas, often referred to as the \\"Soul Queen of New Orleans,\\" was born on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana. She began her music career in the late 1950s, and her early recordings did not quite reach the scale of regional or national hits. The songwriting team of Seely, Newman, Arbuckle, and Sheeran crafted \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" with a timeless melody and heartfelt lyrics. The song expresses the singer's yearning for her lover's understanding and patience in the face of adversity and people's judgment about their relationship. During those early years, Thomas worked with various producers and record labels, but found herself getting connected with the song upon signing with the New York-based Imperial Records. With the help of producer Randy Newman, she recorded \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" and released it as a single in the spring of 1964. Although the song did not achieve widespread chart success at the time, it became a popular ballad that resonated strongly with listeners due to its heartfelt emotion and Thomas' powerful vocal performance. Over the years, \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" has experienced a revival in popularity, being featured on numerous film and television soundtracks, advertisements, and cover versions by various artists. Most notably, the British TV series \\"Black Mirror\\" made the song one of its signature tracks by using it in several episodes dating back to its first season in 2011. Today, the song stands as an iconic example of 1960s soul music, and its message of love and understanding is as relevant as ever. Through the years, \\"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)\\" has garnered a dedicated following and is remembered as an enduring testament to the songwriting and vocal talent of its creators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wildlife photographer Pickett Smith is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential Crockett family. Also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which Pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. After Clint Crockett accidentally tips over Smith's canoe, he and his sister Karen escort Smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire Crockett family. The grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch Jason intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of July and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. Due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, Jason sends a man named Grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. Pickett later discovers Grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. Despite this warning, Jason continues with his celebrations the next day. Early next morning, Michael Martindale sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. He accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. Tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him. Back on the estate, Jason's sister, Iris Martindale sends her son, Kenneth into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. As he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. The geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him. Seeing the danger posed by the animals, Pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but Jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Use warm water and your favorite cleanser to wash away makeup and dirt. Gently pat your face dry with a towel. Pour a small amount of astringent onto the cotton ball, enough to make the top of the ball moist but not soaked through. You may rub it in gently, but do not scrub. If you have combination skin, try dabbing the astringent only in your oily areas (often the forehead, nose, and chin). Skip over any dry areas. Some astringents also come in spray bottles that you can lightly mist over your face without using a cotton ball. Wait for your astringent to absorb slightly. Then, apply a moisturizer that contains an SPF 30 or higher sunscreen. Choose a light moisturizer or one formulated for oily skin. You may think adding moisturizer to oily skin will only make things worse, but drying out your skin too much can cause even more oil production. It’s best to keep your skin balanced with a light moisturizer. Sunscreen is helpful since your skin is more likely to be sensitive to light after using astringent. Apply your astringent once per day, after you wash your face in the morning. Skip the astringent after cleansing your skin in the evening. If desired, you may use toner in the evening in place of astringent. Even the mildest of astringents can burn if you put them on an open cut or scratch on your face. It’s best to avoid these areas and wait to apply astringent until the skin is healthy again. If you feel a burning sensation or your face becomes red after applying astringent, stop using it. Calm your skin by applying moisturizer. Try a more soothing astringent, or switch to using toner instead.

Question: What is Ponyo's mother's name? Movie title: Ponyo Movie plot: Deep under the surface of the ocean, a sea-wizard named Fujimoto (English: Liam Neeson Japanese: George Tokoro) stands at the bow of his submersible, surrounded by an air bubble and an assortment of sea creatures. They swim circles around him as he pours magic potions into the water. Out of a side porthole, a red goldfish peeks out, making sure not to be seen, before waving goodbye to her smaller siblings and swimming off to join a school of jellyfish. She rests on top of one, domed by another, as they float towards the surface and far from her home.When she wakes up, she finds herself in the harbor of a seaside town, Tomonoura. When a large bottom trawler comes towards her, the goldfish swims away from the jellyfish in an attempt to escape but is quickly pulled into the mess of garbage and debris that the trawler picks up in its net. She becomes trapped within a glass jar but manages to escape the net and make it towards shallow water. Meanwhile, a young boy named Sosuke (English: Frankie Jonas Japanese: Hiroki Doi) runs down the hillside path from his home to the water's edge to play with his toy boat. There, he notices the goldfish stuck in the jar and breaks her out of it, though cutting his thumb in the process. As he holds the seemingly lifeless fish in his hands, she licks his wound clean. Happy that she's alive, the boy takes her back up the hill as a series of strange waves come in and reach for him. The waves return to deeper water where Fujimoto is waiting. He is horrified to hear from them that the goldfish, his daughter, has been taken by a human.Sosuke puts the goldfish, which he names Ponyo (English: Noah Lindsey Cyrus Japanese: Yuria Nara), in a bucket full of water and brings her with him to the car where his mother, Lisa (English: Tina Fey Japanese: Tomoko Yamaguchi), is waiting to take him to school. Just before she gets in, she notices Fujimoto crossing her yard with a portable pump on his back. She scolds him for spraying what she thinks is fertilizer, though he attests it's merely pure... The answer is:","completion":"Granmamare is the name of Ponyo's mother in the movie \\"Ponyo\\". She is represented as the goddess of the ocean and is married to Fujimoto, the sea-wizard. Voiced by Cate Blanchett in English and Yūki Amami in Japanese, Granmamare is a majestic and wise character who plays a crucial role in the development of the story. She embodies the nurturing aspects of the ocean and the balance of nature, ensuring harmony between the underwater world and the human realm. Throughout the movie, Granmamare exhibits understanding, compassion, and guidance, not only for her daughter Ponyo but also for young Sosuke and humanity as a whole. Ultimately, it's through her wisdom and guidance that the characters in the story learn the importance of balance and harmony in the world. In deciding whether to invest in a film proposal, it's helpful to consider various aspects, such as the characters, plot, and theme. Ponyo's story, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" has a universal appeal, resonating with audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Its engaging storyline and vivid characters, such as Ponyo's mother Granmamare, contribute to the film's overall success. Moreover, the movie's visual style and direction by the acclaimed filmmaker, Hayao Miyazaki, lends it a unique and captivating charm. Known for their fantastical worlds, enchanting characters, and thoughtful storytelling, Miyazaki's movies, including Ponyo, have a strong emotional pull. The environmentally conscious themes and the exploration of the human-nature relationship make the movie not only entertaining but also thought-provoking. When assessing the worthiness of a film proposal, one should also evaluate its potential performance in the market. Since its release, Ponyo has garnered a positive reception from both audiences and critics, contributing to its commercial success. It also stands as an integral part of Studio Ghibli's legacy, a renowned animation studio with an extensive fan base, which increases the film's marketability. In conclusion, when looking to invest in a film proposal, it's important to consider the characters' depth, the plot's appeal, the film's themes, and its market viability. With Ponyo's engaging story, beautifully portrayed characters like Granmamare, visually stunning animation, and the Studio Ghibli connection, it seems that such a proposal has the potential to be a promising investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Murdered: Police have confirmed that 17-year-old Georgia Williams died from 'pressure to the neck' Teenage murder victim Georgia Williams was probably choked to death with a ligature, police have revealed. Earlier today Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said the 17-year-old died from 'pressure to her neck'. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered 'strangulation' injuries probably caused by having a ligature wrapped around her throat. A West Mercia police spokesman added: 'The guidance being given is that she probably died as a result of strangulation injuries. 'This would be different to being 'strangled' which suggests someone putting their hands around her. 'It is likely a ligature of some sort was used.' Detectives also said Georgia's body had been formally identified, four days after she was found dead in woodland near Wrexham. The results of the post mortem examination were held at Wellington Civic Centre at the same time that her friend Jamie Reynolds appeared at court, charged with murder. The 22-year-old has yet to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on September 6. Wearing a yellow top with a green collar via prison video-link he spoke only to give his name, acknowledge the judge and to confirm that he understood proceedings. Speaking as Georgia's inquest was opened and adjourned, Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said: 'I can now confirm that the body found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham on Friday afternoon has been formally identified as that of 17-year-old Georgia Williams. 'Although we are not in a position to release any further details for legal reasons, and out of respect for the Williams family at this terribly sad time, I am also able to confirm that Georgia died as a result of pressure being applied to her neck.' Police arrested Reynolds in Glasgow last Wednesday and charged him with murder on Friday following the discovery of a body in woodland near Wrexham. Georgia, whose parents were not in court, went missing from her home in Wellington on Sunday, May 26. Jamie Reynolds, 22, from Wellington, appeared at Stafford Crown Court via video-link today. Detectives today renewed their appeal for members of the public to get in touch if they find the teenager's missing personal items, including her phone, jacket and make-up bag. DS McGee added: 'Although the investigation has progressed quite quickly over the past few days, there is still a lot of work for us to do. 'We are continuing to look for the missing bag, make-up bag, mobile phone and clothing that belonged to Georgia and searches are still ongoing to locate this property. 'The bag is a distinctive spotty leather satchel and her smart phone is a white Samsung Galaxy Y. The make-up bag is pink with a flowered pattern and contained various items of make-up. Steven and Lynette Williams (left) parents of Georgia Williams struggle to contain their emotions at a tribute to their daughter at Wellington AFC football ground last Saturday. A police officer stands watch at the Nant-y-Garth pass near Ruthin, north Wales, where Georgia Williams' body was discovered. 'The missing coat is described as a waist-length black leather-type jacket with a stand-up collar, which she was wearing when she was last seen leaving her family's home in Wellington at 7.30pm on Sunday May 26. 'Locating these items is still extremely important to us, while we also remain keen to hear from anyone who believes they may have seen the Toyota Hiace 300 GS panel van, registration number CX06 ASV, on Monday 27 or Tuesday 28 May. 'If anyone believes they still have information that could aid our investigation I would like to ask that they share it with us as soon as they can, even if they are unsure whether the information is related to this case.'

The three groups we will focus on are White people, African American people, and American Indian people. You might be asking how many of these people, in terms of percentage, are either White, African American, or American Indian? Good question, my young friend! First, let's understand what we mean by \\"percentage.\\" Imagine you have 100 colorful candies. The percentage tells you how many of each color there are in that 100 candy mix. Now, let's talk about the people in the United States. According to recent data, in the United States, 61.1% of people are White, 13.4% are African American, and 1.3% are American Indian. Let's do some adding! To find out how many people out of 100 (that's the percentage) belong to these three groups, we'll add those numbers together. So, it will be: 61.1% (White people) + 13.4% (African American people) + 1.3% (American Indian people) = <+75.8%> (% of people who are White, African American, or American Indian) And there you have it! Out of 100 people in the United States, about 75.8 of them are either White, African American, or American Indian.

Even though this cover is a fairly large size, I was able to fold it to where it would fit in this small space. Because of the way it was folded, I think it made the tie downs a little more difficult to secure.

Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story.

Women in Finland enjoy a \\"high degree of equality\\" and \\"traditional courtesy\\" among men. In 1906, the women of Finland became the first women in Europe to be granted the right to vote. There are many women in Finland who hold prominent positions in Finnish society, in the academics, in the field of business, and in the government of Finland. An example of powerful women in Finnish politics is Tarja Halonen, who became the first female president of the country (she was Foreign Minister of Finland before becoming president). In the late 18th century and early 19th century private schools for girls were established in Finland, among the more known being those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. These schools were criticized for its shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the school reform of 1843, and the following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki, Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Abo and Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors. This led to the establishment of a net of girl schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first the schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. At this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865 a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable and whose company can't be considered detrimental to others, and who were from \\"respectable\\" families could be in the school. After the first woman in Finland, Maria Tschetschulin, was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and colleges classes were included in many girl schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation), and in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish language upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882. When the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girl schools in Finland started to be changed to same sex education, a development which was completed in the 1970s.","completion":"This text is about the historical progress and achievements of women in Finland.

All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march.

The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if it were run my an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style). Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to (*ahem*) drive your car and burn gas. Sort of the opposite of today's Enron-and-Bush, oil-grabbing, SUV-pushing government. This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable. But wait...there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we're not shown any signs of future technology, beyond a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today. Same clothing, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternate energy. The acting is flat and flavorless. Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving, buddy-flick, honor, romance, horror... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. Continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.

It has a great camera, is user-friendly, and the battery life is pretty good. Plus, it's not that expensive anymore since newer models have come out. Harry: That's a good choice!

Vanessa: I see. But how popular are these older models now? I mean, are they still supported with software updates and security patches? Harry: That's a concern, I agree. The iPhone 6 still receives software updates from Apple, but the frequency has lessened with newer models being introduced. As for the Galaxy S6 and S7, they don't receive regular updates anymore but they should be pretty secure as long as you stick to trusted and verified applications.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. and the situation: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. Answer the following question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Answer:","completion":"From the information provided in the background, we can understand that the intensity of sound is directly proportional to the decibel level. In other words, higher decibel levels translate to more intense, louder sounds. Consequently, such high-intensity sounds pose a risk for potential damage to the ears and resultant hearing loss. In the situation presented, Jonathan is exposed to two primary sources of sound - the fireworks display and a flyover by jet fighter planes. The intensity of these sound sources is not given directly in numerical terms but we are informed that the sound intensity of the jets flyover was higher than that of the fireworks. Since the risk of ear damage is tied directly to the intensity of the sound, the fireworks, with a lower intensity than the jets, would be less likely to cause damage to Jonathan's ears. However, it is important to note that the term 'less likely' does not imply 'no risk'. Even if the decibel level of the fireworks is lower than that of the jet flyover, if it was still a high-decibel sound, Jonathan's hearing could be potentially affected. This is due to the logarithmic nature of decibel scale where a 10-decibel increase translates to 10 times increase in loudness. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Jonathan to use ear protection in both situations to fully avoid the risk of any hearing damage due to exposure to these high-intensity sounds. In conclusion, while in comparison, the fireworks at the football game posed less of a risk to Jonathan's ears than the jet flyover, both high-intensity sounds carry with them the potential for hearing damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s not the official score report that GMAC sends after 15-20 days. India available in types of chees? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you've presented are distinct from one another, addressing two separate topics. Let me provide detailed and long answers for both of them: 1. Is the test taker report for GMAT accessible immediately after the test? It’s not the official score report that GMAC sends after 15-20 days. The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a computer adaptive test taken by prospective MBA and business school candidates to gauge their analytical, writing, and mathematical skills. Administered by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT score plays a significant role in business school admissions. On finishing the GMAT, candidates can view their unofficial scores instantly. The moment the test ends, an on-screen message explains the reporting procedure and offers a choice to accept or cancel the scores. If the candidate accepts the scores, the unofficial test taker report, which includes the Verbal, Quantitative, and Integrated Reasoning scores, is readily available. The total score, without the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) score, appears. However, this is only an informal report and isn't the complete official score report. The official score report, which incorporates the AWA score, is available within the mentioned 15-20 days following the exam. GMAC sends this report to the candidate's chosen business schools. Moreover, the applicant receives an email containing instructions to access the online official scores. 2. India available in types of chees? This question seems to be about the types of cheese available in India. India has a diverse food culture with numerous regional cuisines and a variety of dairy dishes. Although the popularity of cheese is not as widespread as in Western countries, India has its indigenous and diverse variations of cheese. Here are some popular Indian cheeses: a. Paneer: Paneer, also called Indian cottage cheese, is an unaged, non-melting cheese made from curdled milk and a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. Widely consumed in Indian dishes, it's used in savory preparations like paneer tikka, shahi paneer, and paneer butter masala, and in desserts like rasgulla and rasmalai. b. Chhena: Chhena (or chhana) is similar to paneer but has a softer, crumbly texture. It's an essential component of most Bengali sweets like sandesh, chum chum, and kheer kadam. c. Kalari: Also called maish krej, the traditional Kalari cheese hails from the Kashmir region. The milk used originates from either the cow or the buffalo. Often compared to mozzarella, it is served fried, accompanied by local spices and vegetables. d. Dalle: Dalle, found predominantly in the Sikkim region, is a fermented and dried cheese made from cow's milk. Often used as a condiment or flavor enhancer, it lends itself to soups, stews, or curries. e. Bandel: Originating from Bengal, Bandel cheese is a combination of Portuguese and Bengali cheese-making practices. It's available in two variants, plain and smoked, and is traditionally wrapped in palm leaves. Additionally, due to globalization and changing dietary preferences, several international cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, brie, camembert, and feta can be found at gourmet food stores, larger supermarkets, and online stores in India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The second E85 flexifuel model introduced by Saab in the Swedish market. Question: what part of the corn is used in ethanol production","completion":"While I understand that you are looking for a simple yes or no answer, the question provided requires a more detailed response to accurately address the topic of ethanol fuel and its production from corn. To answer the question \\"What part of the corn is used to produce ethanol?\\": The main component of corn that is used in the production of ethanol is the corn kernel, specifically the starch within the kernel. Ethanol is produced through a process that involves the fermentation of sugars, and the starch within the corn kernel is an ideal source of these fermentable sugars. The process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Harvesting: Corn is harvested and transported to an ethanol production facility. 2. Milling: In the facility, the corn kernels are ground into a fine powder called cornmeal. This process makes it easier to extract the valuable starches within the kernel. 3. Liquefaction: The cornmeal is mixed with water and enzymes, creating a mash. The enzymes help to break down the starches into simpler sugars, such as glucose and maltose. 4. Fermentation: Yeast is introduced to the mash, which then converts the sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process typically takes place in large fermentation tanks. 5. Distillation: The fermented mash is heated, and the ethanol is separated from the remaining solid and liquid components. The ethanol vapor is then condensed back into a liquid form. 6. Dehydration: The distilled ethanol is then passed through a dehydration process to remove any remaining water, resulting in anhydrous ethanol – the final product. 7. Co-products: The leftover solid components, known as distillers grains, are often used as livestock feed, while the liquid components can be used in various other applications such as fertilizers. It is also worth mentioning the Saab E85 flexifuel models, since you brought them up in your initial statement. These vehicles are designed to run on a blend of gasoline and ethanol called E85, which contains up to 85% ethanol. The introduction of such models by Saab demonstrates the increasing popularity and growing acceptance of ethanol as an alternative, sustainable fuel source. This expanding market is one of the reasons why understanding the process of ethanol production from corn is essential. In conclusion, the production of ethanol fuel primarily utilizes the starch found in corn kernels. The process involves several steps including milling, liquefaction, fermentation, distillation, and dehydration, resulting in a sustainable and renewable fuel source that can be used in vehicles like the Saab E85 flexifuel models."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Saloninus, born around 242 AD, was the son of Roman Emperor Gallienus and his wife, Cornelia Salonina. He belonged to the Licinius Dynasty and was titled 'Caesar of the Roman Empire.' An image of him can be seen on an Antoninianus of Saloninus. Saloninus' reign began in 258 AD when his father designated him as a Caesar, a title typically given to heirs apparent or junior emperors. He served under Gallienus, and his reign continued until (perhaps) July 260. During his brief time as a full emperor, Saloninus held the title of Caesar and succeeded his father, Gallienus. Despite having a short reign, the young emperor Saloninus had to face many challenges. His predecessor, Gallienus, is said to have ruled during a particularly tumultuous period in Roman history when the empire was under constant threat from external invasions and internal power struggles. Saloninus' mother, Cornelia Salonina, played a significant role in his life, providing support and counsel. However, it was not enough for Saloninus to hold on to power, and his reign took a tragic turn in 260 when he was reportedly killed in Colonia Agrippina, the place of his death.

As a result, they would have consumed more calories than their body could burn, leading to an unhealthy weight gain over time. Obesity is a medical condition where a person has an excessive amount of body fat, which can lead to various health problems such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart diseases, and certain types of cancer. The other options do not accurately describe the long-term consequences of the person's overeating and lack of exercise. A. Hungry: While it may be surprising, a person who consistently overeats may still experience hunger, as hunger is not solely determined by the amount of food consumed. It is also influenced by hormonal and emotional factors. B. Gas: Overeating and lack of exercise can sometimes lead to digestive problems, including gas. However, gas is a temporary problem and not a long-term consequence of an imbalanced intake of calories and exercise. D. Gain weight: Gaining weight could be a part of obesity, but merely gaining weight does not give the full picture of the adverse health effects that can result from chronic overeating and lack of exercise. Obesity refers to an excessive accumulation of body fat, specifically. E. Feeling full: While overeating can leave a person feeling full, it does not describe the long-term effects of overeating without exercising. A person may feel full after a large meal, but eventually, the excessive calories consumed will lead to obesity. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is obesity (C), as it best describes the long-term consequences of eating too much and not exercising enough. Obesity can lead to severe health problems and should be addressed by adopting a balanced diet and incorporating regular exercise into daily routines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The new Steven Spielberg blockbuster \\"Lincoln\\" focuses on the final months of the U.S. president's life as he tries to find a way to end the Civil War and unite the country. Now, the document Lincoln signed that officially started the war is up for sale, valued at nearly a million dollars. The one-page document, signed April 19, 1861, authorized the blockade of Southern ports, which, under international law, was an act of war. \\"The action was bold and with great risk,\\" said Nathan Raab, vice president of The Raab Collection, which is offering the document for sale at 900,000. Potential buyers can make contact with the seller through the","completion":"Raab Collection's website or by visiting their physical location in Philadelphia, where they can get a closer look at the historically significant document and learn more about its provenance. As a rare and highly sought-after artifact, it holds immense value not just monetarily, but also as a tangible representation of one of the most pivotal moments in American history. The blockade effectively cut off trade and supplies to the Confederacy, significantly weakening the region's economy and bolstering the Union's efforts to quell the rebellion. As the Civil War raged on, the blockade played a crucial role in ultimately securing the Union's victory, and as a result, the document is of particular interest to collectors and history buffs alike. In addition to Lincoln's signed document, interested parties may also find other unique pieces of American history at the Raab Collection, including documents signed by other prominent figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Each piece comes with the assurance of authenticity, expert research, and attentive care that the Raab Collection is known for, ensuring that these historically significant items are preserved and appreciated for generations to come. Though the price tag of 900,000 may seem steep for some, the opportunity to own a tangible piece of history can be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for an avid collector, an institution, or even a private individual who has a deep appreciation for historical artifacts. The document serves as a constant reminder of President Lincoln's unwavering determination to preserve the United States, making it a valuable acquisition for those who understand the significance of his actions and their lasting impact on the country. Moreover, owning a document as rare and historically important as this one can also contribute to keeping the memory of this period alive, fostering discussions about the implications of the Civil War and the significance of Lincoln's actions in shaping the future of the United States.

Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told.

When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car.

In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by Edward Bruce in 1315-18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: In which of the six main climatic zones of the country that is predominantly temperate is precipitation very heavy?, using the article: The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 °C (41.2 °F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 °C (77.4 °F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July.

The dead man, Professor Grabowski, is associated with the Brandt Research center, and an autopsy reveals he died of a massive coronary during sexual intercourse. Another similar death is discovered almost immediately, this time a younger man. This causes the federal government to send in Agent Neil Agar (William Smith) to get to the bottom of things. He gets the background on the deaths by consulting with local police captain Peters.In the small town the Brandt Facility is doing research with genetics and atomic power. Grabowski's assistant, Julie Zorn (Victoria Vetri), becomes Agar's contact in the investigation. More men turn up dead of sexual exhaustion, including a 21 year old man, and the locals become highly agitated. It seems there are a lot of aggressive male types in Peckham, and Julie tells Neil that the scientists at Brandt are no different than the others, preoccupied with sex and enjoying a promiscuous lifestyle that includes partner-swapping. Other Brandt luminaries are not so fortunate, such as geneticist Stan Williams, whose wife treats him in a cold and shrewish manner.When Brandt's Dr. Murger suggests that he has a theory about the strange deaths, he is subsequently run down by a car, driven by an unseen person. When Agar investigates, he discovers that Murger had a male lover and was not interested in women sexually at all. The socially distant Dr. Susan Harris (Anitra Ford), who is in charge of some mysterious research in bee culture, becomes a key suspect for Agar. Harris makes a move on Brandt scientist Herb Kline, inviting him over to her house, seducing him, and having sex with him. During intercourse, her eyes suddenly turn completely black, and Kline suffers a fatal heart attack just like the other men. After Kline's death, his wife receives a phone call from an unidentified female, luring her to Dr. Harris's lab, where Harris and a number of other women overpower her and force her through a strange process where she is stripped nude, covered in a mysterious substance, and placed in a chamber adjacent to a colony of bees, which cover her. Harris has a large machine setup that bombards her female victims with radiation, transforming them into women who have the ability to kill men by having sex with them.The next day, Captain Peters goes to visit Mrs. Kline to inform her of her husband's death, but instead of reacting with grief, she becomes sexually aggressive and attempts to seduce him. Fortunately, he leaves. Stan Williams isn't so lucky; his recently transformed wife seduces him and manages to kill him. In an ironic twist, he strangles her as he dies and they both wind up dead. Agar manages to piece the puzzle together himself, but before he can apprehend Dr. Harris, she lures Julie into her lab and begins the transformation process on her. Agar arrives in time to stop the procedure, firing a bullet into Harris's machine and breaking it. The lab begins to explode, and the bee girls slowly die, including Dr. Harris. The film ends as Agar and Julie begin a romantic interlude., Question: What is the name of the research center?

Write some highlights for the following article: A daredevil sailor has had his name written into the record books - after karate chopping a dozen wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000ft. Ernie Torres, a skydiving instructor who serves in the US Navy, combined his love of jumping from planes with his other hobby - he is a black belt in karate - to smash his way through 12 blocks on his descent back down to earth. Ernie jumped from such a height that he had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the free fall just so that his brain was engaged enough to pull his parachute chord. Scroll down for video:. Daredevil: Ernie Torres smashed his way into the record books by karate chopping a dozen wooden blocks during a skydive. Team effort: Fellow skydivers from Team Arizona jumped with Ernie and held up the wooden blocks for him to chop. Charitable: Ernie Torres decided to break the record to raise awareness of a US charity which helps wounded servicemen and women. He completed his unusual feat in a 70 second free fall which saw him plummet 12,000 feet. He said: 'It really was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of my life. 'As if throwing myself from an airplane and falling towards the earth at terminal velocity wasn't exciting enough, I thought I'd throw a little karate in the mix and try to smash a world record while I was at it. 'We jumped from an altitude of 16,000 feet and I would deploy my parachute at 4,000 feet, which gave me approximately 70 seconds of free fall. Nerves of steel: Even a delay due to a technical fault with the team's plane couldn't deter Ernie, who leapt from a staggering 16,000 ft to perform his stunt. Down to earth: The intrepid blackbelt, who serves in the US Navy, had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the freefall to avoid developing hypoxia which could have stopped him pulling his parachute chord. 'That may seem like forever to some but it's not very long when you're trying to break a world record.' Ernie had to wear an oxygen mask because falling from such a height can cause hypoxia - a condition caused by lack of oxygen to the brain which can cause a person to become giddy and lack the sensible reasoning needed to pull the parachute chord. As well as remembering to pull the chord, Ernie had to focus long enough on a team of fellow jumpers from Skydive Arizona holding the wooden boards for him to chop. Tough task: Ernie had to fight against the force of his fall to chop the 12 wooden boards. Flying high: He is seen here smashing his way through one of the wooden boards during a 70 second freefall high above the Arizona skyline. Challenge: Ernie decided to tackle the task after watching a video of the previous record holder carrying out his stunt. Ernie added: 'The team of guys that held the board for me were amazing. 'It's the equivalent of having a team of flying Michael Jordans on the basketball court with you asking you what you want them to do.' Virginia based Ernie decided to complete the jump after watching a video of the previous record holder, actor and mixed martial artist Jason David Frank. Even a nerve-wracking hour long wait thanks to technical difficulties with the team's aircraft didn't deter Ernie and he completed the jump to raise awareness The Wounded Warrior Project, a charity which helps wounded US servicemen and women. Adventure: The intrepid servicemen said that completing the jump was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of his life. Mission complete: He finally deployed his parachute 4,000 ft above the ground and safely completed the rest of the descent. He said: 'After watching the video of the current record holder, one thought came to mind, I can do better and use the publicity of something like this to raise awareness of what I thought was a well deserving cause - one that had personal meaning to me and many of the people I've served with in the Armed Forces over the years - The Wounded Warrior Project.' Due to technical difficulties, Ernie and his team had to switch aircraft at the last minute which resulted in Ernie having to wait a long and agonising hour before take-off. Crack team: Ernie described the team who completed the jump with him as like having a group of Michael Jordans around him on a basketball court.","completion":"Daredevil sailor and US Navy skydiving instructor Ernie Torres has set a new world record by karate chopping twelve wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000 feet.

Movie title: Saigo no Yakusoku Movie plot: Saigo no Yakusoku (The Last Promise) is a Japanese TV film drama special starring the members of the boy band \\"Arashi\\" in their first acting project together in nearly ten years. The story begins by the introduction of five seemingly very different young men and their reasons for being at the Energy Bio Corporation building: janitor Satoru Mashiko (Satoshi Ohno), motorcycle courier Nozomu Got (Jun Matsumoto), coffee shop employee Akira Tanada (Masaki Aiba), insurance salesman Yukio Tomizawa (Sho Sakurai) and security center employee Shji Yamagiwa (Kazunari Ninomiya). Without warning, a masked gunman suddenly appears on the TV monitors in the lobbies on each floor of the high rise and announces that he and his allies have hijacked the building, everyone inside is a hostage, and that a bomb that will go off in ninety minutes should Energy Bio Corporation President Niimi (Masahiko Tsugawa) not arrive with the ransom. Before she is locked in the rest of the hostages in the fifth floor lobby, Yuriko Niimi (Meisa Kuroki), the daughter of the president, manages to slip away into the stairwell of the building along with motorcycle courier Got. Prior to the lockdown by the masked men, coffee shop employee Tanada found a hiding place in a nearby supply room and has been keeping in contact by cell phone with Niimi and chief detective Genji Morozumi (Yukiya Kitamura) at the police station. Meanwhile, Yuriko quickly collects company data that is worth more than the ransom money. She confesses to Got that she believes her father isn't concerned for her safety at all and that he's only interested in saving his company. In turn, Got reveals a bit of his own past and how his trusted friend died ten years ago. The electricity in the building is momentarily cut off, which allows most of the hostages to escape. This gives security manager Shinichir Okanaka (Naohito Fujiki) the opportunity to distract the gunmen while security employee Yamagiwa opens the doors on the second floor, allowing more hostages to escape after the power...

What can cause a moving object to increase its speed in a forward direction? Select from: (1). a force pushing on the object from the opposite direction. (2). a force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving. (3). an increase in the mass of the object. (4). a decrease in the mass of the object.","completion":"To determine which option can cause a moving object to increase its speed in a forward direction, we need to analyze each option in the context of Newton's second law of motion, which states that Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma). An increase in speed (or forward acceleration) requires a net force acting in the direction of motion. (1). A force pushing on the object from the opposite direction: This would result in a retarding or decelerating force, as it acts against the direction of motion. It would not cause the object to increase its speed in the forward direction. (2). A force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving: This option is consistent with Newton's second law of motion for forward acceleration (increased speed). A force acting in the same direction as the object is moving would result in its acceleration or an increase in its speed. (3). An increase in the mass of the object: Assuming the same force is being applied to the object, an increase in mass would result in a decrease in acceleration (a = F/m), not an increase in speed. (4). A decrease in the mass of the object: Similar to option (3), a decrease in mass could lead to an increase in acceleration (a = F/m) only if the same force is being applied to the object, but this option does not explicitly specify the application of any force. Based on the analysis above, the correct option is: (2). A force that continually acts on the object in the direction the object is moving. This is because a force acting in the same direction as the object's motion results in its acceleration or an increase in its speed, consistent with Newton's second law of motion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname.

Question: What is the first name of the person who meets a mysterious man? Answer the above question based on the context below: The film is set in an alternative-history version of nineteenth century England where packs of wolves roam the countryside. Bonnie Green is the spoiled daughter of Lord and Lady Willoughby, who live at the country estate of Willoughby Chase. Lady WIlloughby is ill, and her father plans to take a convalescence to the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, in London, Bonnie's cousin, Sylvia, is leaving her Aunt Jane to keep Bonnie company while her parents are away. While travelling on a train, she meets a mysterious man named Grimshaw. At Willoughby Chase, a beautiful middle-aged woman arrives revealing herself to be Bonnie and Sylvia's fourth cousin and their new governess, Letitia Slighcarp. The following morning, Bonnie sneaks into the carriage meant to pick up Sylvia, taking with her a rifle. When the train arrives at the station, Mr. Grimshaw is knocked unconscious after wolves attempt to attack the train. Bonnie and Sylvia take Mr. Grimshaw with them back to Willoughby Chase. Not soon after, Bonnie's parents leave for their convalescence aboard the Thessaly. The next day, Bonnie and Sylvia go out on a sleigh and almost are attacked by wolves until a boy named Simon, who lives in a cave and raises geese, rescues them. They return in the night to discover that Miss Slighcarp has dismissed all the servants except for James and Pattern. During dinner, Miss Slighcarp refuses to give an explanation to the servants' dismissal, gives the girls oatmeal instead of the usual feast and she harshly reprimands Bonnie after she accidentally spills cream on her father's farewell letter, thus Bonnie begins to suspect her governess's true cold and evil nature.

Given the background: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). and the situation: John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. Answer the following question: In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? A:","completion":"In respect to decision C, Keith's strategy of relying on his hunches would most likely not maximize the expected utility. This is because, according to the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms, the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility by considering the probability-weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision. Since Keith is not using a systematic approach and rather relying on his feelings, his decision-making process may not be consistent with maximizing expected utility. John, on the other hand, would apply the optimal decision making process, which would likely result in maximizing the expected utility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose help is sought to free someone from the spell of a mirror? , can you please find it? The film takes place in two different times: the present and 11 years earlier. The two plot lines are told in parallel through flashbacks. In 2002, software engineer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces hallucinations. Marie is haunted by visions of her own body decaying, while Alan is seduced by a ghostly woman named Marisol, who has mirrors in place of eyes. Over time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and the family dog disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Into Africa - NYTimes.com A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa. JUST after the turn of the century, a young man who had spent several years inspecting cargo on boats plying the Atlantic between Europe and the mouth of the Congo River called for the imperial regime in the Congo Basin ''to be swept out of existence.'' Edmund Morel is one of a trio of not-quite-English characters who prowl Adam Hochschild's ''King Leopold's Ghost,'' a superb synoptic history of European misdemeanor in central Africa. Like Joseph Conrad, a Polish expatriate, and Roger Casement, an Irishman, Morel was something of an outsider in Britain. The son of a French civil servant, he had lived in poverty in Paris for a good deal of his childhood. All three men were to unleash withering assaults on the system of forced labor that was used to extract ivory, hardwoods and wild rubber from the Congo Free State -- later the Belgian Congo, then Zaire, now the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo. Morel, who discovered that valuable cargoes were leaving the Congo while arms and ammunition were pouring in, became a radical, round-the-clock journalist and public speaker, collecting and disseminating evidence of atrocities against the Congolese and denouncing an international entente that had allowed one man, Leopold II, King of the Belgians, to exercise sole authority over a land mass 75 times the size of Belgium. Casement, a roving British consul in Africa, produced a damning report on the Congo for Parliament in 1904. As eloquent and fastidious as any human rights survey on Rwanda, Algeria or Kurdistan almost a century later, it inflamed British passions against King Leopold. And, at Casement's urging, Morel founded the Congo Reform Association, a formidable engine of popular protest with branches in Europe and the United States. Finally, there is the much-maligned Conrad. Hochschild calls ''Heart of Darkness'' ''the greatest portrait in fiction of Europeans in the scramble for Africa.'' It remains the most widely read and controversial indictment of Leopold's African fiefdom. But ''King Leopold's Ghost'' puts the novel squarely back in the context of European barbarity -- the context that had transfixed Morel, who praised Conrad's story as a proper ''picture of Congo life.'' Hochschild's sketches of these three individuals are vivid, and his depiction of what they and many others were confronting is masterly. It shows, above all, that during Leopold's rule in Africa from 1885 to 1908, and in the years on either side of it, the peoples of the Congo River Basin suffered, in Hochschild's words, ''a death toll of Holocaust dimensions.'' This is not said lightly. The strategy adopted to plunder the area was, in effect, a war of enslavement against the indigenous population. Much of the death toll was the result of killing, pure and simple. Villages were dragooned into tapping rubber, and if they refused to comply, or complied but failed to meet European quotas, they were punished. The hands of dead Congolese were severed and kept by militias to account to their quartermasters for spent ammunition. And, as Morel said, the practice of mutilation was extended to the living. By far the greatest number of deaths, however, were caused by sickness and starvation. The effect of the terror was to drive communities from their sources of food. A Belgian Government commission estimated that from the late 1870's, when the explorer Henry Morton Stanley made his first forays into the Congo on King Leopold's behalf, until 1919, the year the commission published its findings, the population of the Congo Basin had been reduced by half. In 1924 there were thought to be some 10 million inhabitants -- which means, Hochschild says, that ''during the Leopold period and its immediate aftermath the population of the territory dropped by approximately 10 million.'' To Hochschild, the author of ''The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin,'' the Congo holocaust is a modern story. King Leopold, who cloaked his ambitions for an African territory in a mist of hypocrisy about piercing ''the darkness which hangs over entire peoples'' and ''abolishing the slave trade,'' had the qualities of a great public-relations impresario. He knew whom to bring on board to sell his idea, how to sell it and where. He put Stanley in charge of a great opening up of the Congo River and, when he wasn't in Africa, sent him on tour to address crowded halls about civilizing ''the neglected millions of the dark continent.'' In Washington, the King's key man was Henry Shelton Sanford, a wealthy orange planter and Republican supporter with access to President Chester A. Arthur. In an audience with the President in 1883, Sanford presented the idea of a ''Congo Free State'' under Leopold's aegis as a rerun of the Liberian experiment begun in the 1820's on the initiative of the American Colonization Society. He said much the same to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Tyler Morgan, a harebrained white supremacist from Alabama who wanted to cleanse America of freed slaves (he'd already considered Hawaii, Cuba and the Philippines as possible dumping grounds for black people). Summary:","completion":"\\"King Leopold's Ghost,\\" a book by Adam Hochschild, tells the story of the European exploitation of Congo under King Leopold II of Belgium. It focuses on three individuals—Edmund Morel, Roger Casement, and Joseph Conrad—who exposed the forced labor system and atrocities committed against the Congolese. The book argues that under Leopold's rule from 1885 to 1908, the region suffered a death toll on par with the Holocaust due to violence, sickness, and starvation. The population of Congo Basin reduced by half during that time and the immediate aftermath, with an estimated 10 million people dying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the authority whose responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs? is inside the article: Altrincham became a Free Borough, a self-governing township, when it was granted a charter in June 1290 by the Lord of the Manor, Hamon de Massey V. The charter allowed for the creation of a merchants' guild, run by the town's burgesses to tax people passing through the borough. Burgesses were free men who lived in the town. The borough was ruled by a Court Leet and elected a mayor since at least 1452. Amongst the court's responsibilities were keeping the public peace and regulating the markets and fairs.The borough was not one of those reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, and continued to exist under the control of the Lord of the Manor and the Court Leet until its final abolition in 1886. The Public Health Act of 1848 led to the creation of Altrincham's Local Board of Health in 1851 to address the unsanitary conditions created by the town's growing population – the first such board in Trafford.The local board was reconstituted as an urban district council in the administrative county of Cheshire under the Local Government Act 1894. Altrincham Urban District was expanded in 1920 when parts of Carrington and Dunham Massey Civil Parishes were added. A further expansion took place in 1936; Timperley Civil Parish was abolished and most of its area incorporated into Altrincham UD. At the same time, there was a minor exchange of areas with Hale Urban District; a minor addition from Bowdon Urban District; and a further substantial portion of Dunham Massey Civil Parish was added. In 1937 the urban district was granted a charter of incorporation and became a municipal borough. The new borough was granted armorial bearings which featured heraldic references to the Masseys and Earls of Stamford. With the passage of the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties and municipal boroughs were abolished and Altrincham became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974.Trafford Council is responsible for the administration of local services, such as education,..., can you guess it ?

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. But, I didn't rate it as a \\"great film\\", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.

Background Paragraph: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see post-perovskite) and supplemented by seismic tomography. The mantle is mainly composed of silicates, and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes plate tectonics possible. Story: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.

This sentence seems to be referring to a scientific or medical study, possibly involving testing on animals. It states that among the males (possibly animals or humans) that were exposed to a high dosage (likely of a particular substance or treatment), two significant results were observed. Firstly, there was increased mortality. This means that a higher than expected number of deaths occurred among the males who were given this high dosage. A variety of reasons could cause this increased mortality, such as toxic effects of the substance, interaction with other treatments or conditions, or vulnerability due to age or other factors. However, without additional context, it's impossible to say what is the exact cause in this specific case. Secondly, reduced body weights were observed. This means that the males in this group likely weighed less than expected or saw a decrease in their body weight over time. Again, numerous factors could potentially cause this weight decrease, such as loss of appetite, increased metabolism, muscles wasting, or other effects of the substance or treatment. Depending on what exactly this substance or treatment is, this weight loss could be either a direct effect or a side effect. Additional information would provide a more clear understanding.

According to the Oregonian and Reuters, police found no evidence of foul play in her death. Jennifer, who was last seen on CCTV footage running errands in Dundee, near Portland, leaves behind her husband and their two sons, ages 6 and 2. Disappearance: Jennifer Huston disappeared on the evening of July 24th, after informing her husband that she was off to run some errands in the nearby town of Dundee. Surveillance video obtained by the police showed Jennifer making various transactions including withdrawing 100 from an ATM machine, purchasing over-the-counter sleeping pills from a drug store, and filling up her SUV with gas before vanishing without a trace. Search Efforts and Discovery: Following her disappearance, Jennifer's distraught husband reported her as a missing person, and a large-scale search operation was launched, involving local authorities and dedicated volunteers from the community. Meanwhile, the family also initiated a social media campaign to raise awareness of her disappearance and gather any possible leads. Despite their best efforts, it was a property owner in Sheridan, about 20 miles from where Jennifer was last seen, who stumbled upon her abandoned vehicle on August 5th. The SUV was found on a remote logging road, and police discovered her body nearby soon after. As of now, authorities have not released details on the cause of death but have stated there is no indication of foul play. Jennifer's Health and Family: In the days leading up to her disappearance, Jennifer's husband reported that she had been suffering from headaches but was otherwise in good health.

In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.

Math Problem Solve 0 = 12*h + h + 13 for h.","completion":"To solve the given equation 0 = 12h + h + 13 for h, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms There are two terms with the variable 'h': 12h and h. Combine them: 0 = 13h + 13 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'h' In order to isolate h, we need to get rid of the constant term that's being added to the 13h term. In this case, the constant term is 13. As we want to isolate h, we will perform the inverse operation of the constant term. Since it's +13, we will subtract 13 from both sides: 0 - 13 = 13h + 13 - 13 -13 = 13h Step 3: Solve for 'h' Now, we need to isolate h by dividing both sides by the coefficient of h, which is 13: -13 / 13 = 13h / 13 -1 = h Thus, h = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The shrimp didn't cook well on the grill, while the steak was perfect, since the","completion":"shrimp required a more delicate and precise cooking method, whereas the steak's thickness and composition allowed for even heat distribution and proper caramelization, ultimately resulting in a more satisfying culinary experience. When grilling shrimp, there are several factors that can influence the cooking process and the final result. Firstly, the size of the shrimp plays a crucial role, as smaller shrimp tend to cook much faster than larger ones. Therefore, it's essential to choose the appropriate grilling technique based on their size. Secondly, shrimp are highly sensitive to heat and overcooking can lead to a rubbery, unappetizing texture. The ideal heat level for grilling shrimp should be medium-high, enabling it to cook through evenly while maintaining a tender and succulent interior. To ensure that the shrimp doesn't cook too quickly or unevenly, it's important to keep a close eye on them and turn them frequently for even exposure to heat. On the other hand, the steak's successful grilling can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the thickness of the steak allows for even heat distribution, which ensures that the steak is thoroughly cooked on the inside while developing a desirable sear on the outside. Moreover, the steak's composition, including its marbling and fat content, play a substantial role in creating a perfectly cooked steak. This is because the fat renders during the cooking process, which contributes to a juicy and flavorful steak. Additionally, the steak's outer surface contains proteins and sugars that undergo the Maillard reaction when exposed to high heat. This reaction creates a series of complex, caramelized and savory flavor compounds that greatly enhance the taste of the steak. In contrast, the relatively low protein and sugar content in shrimp prevents the Maillard reaction from occurring to a significant extent, thus limiting the development of analogous flavors. Another important factor to consider while grilling steak is the appropriate level of doneness desired, with rare, medium, and well-done being the three primary stages. Each stage corresponds to a specific internal temperature of the steak, which can be monitored using a meat thermometer. By attaining the desired internal temperature, one can ensure that the steak is cooked to perfection in terms of taste, texture, and appearance. In conclusion, the shrimp didn't cook well on the grill, while the steak was perfect because allowing for a comparison between their distinct characteristics and grilling requirements. Shrimp require a more delicate and precise cooking method, while steak's thickness, composition, and overall suitability to high heat result in a delicious and satisfying meal. To achieve optimal results, it's essential to understand the unique properties of each ingredient and modify the cooking techniques accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams. So our hearts are broken today -- for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for, as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain. As a country, we have been through this too many times, whether it's an elementary school in Newtown or a shopping mall in Oregon or a temple in Wisconsin or a movie theater in Aurora or a street corner in Chicago. These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children, and we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics. This evening, Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter, and we'll tell them that we love them, and we'll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight, and they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help, because while nothing can fill the space of a lost child or a loved one, all of us can extend a hand to those in need to remind them that we are there for them, that we are praying for them, that the love they felt for those they lost endures not just in their memories but also in ours.

Given the question: Information: - The Tanakh (or ; also \\"Tenakh\\", \\"Tenak\\", \\"Tanach\\") or Mikra or Hebrew Bible is the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is also a textual source for the Christian Old Testament. These texts are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others). The traditional Hebrew text is known as the Masoretic Text. The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books. - Hagar ( of uncertain origin Hjar) is a biblical person in the Book of Genesis. She was an Egyptian handmaid of Sarai (Sarah), who gave her to Abraham to bear a child. The product of the union was Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael, the progenitor of the Ishmaelites. According to Theodor Nöldeke, she is the biblical personification of the nomadic Hagrites. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - Abrahamic religions, emphasizing and tracing their common origin to the tribal patriarch Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him, are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions). Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the largest Abrahamic religions in terms of numbers of adherents. - Leah (\\"Lea\\"; \\"La'ya;\\" from ), as described in the Hebrew Bible, is the first of the two concurrent wives of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and mother of six sons whose descendants became some of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, along with one daughter, Dinah. Leah was the daughter of Laban and the older sister of Rachel, whom Jacob also married. - Esau (Hebrew: ; Standard Hebrew: \\"Esav\\"; Tiberian Hebrew: w; ISO 259-3 \\"eaw\\"; \\"Hsau\\" \\"saw\\"; meaning \\"Hairy\\" or \\"Rough\\"), in the Hebrew Bible, is the older son of Isaac. He is mentioned in the Book of Genesis, and by the prophets, Obadiah and Malachi.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: What a Scientist Is Like If you were asked to imagine a scientist, what image would come to your mind? The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring! Answer:","completion":"Question: Based on the article, which of the following statements best describes the true nature of a scientist's work? A. Scientists only work in laboratories wearing white lab coats and mixing chemicals. B. Scientists are strange people who work 100 hours a week in a lonely laboratory. C. Scientists engage in a variety of experiences, including wildlife conservation, studying seismic activity, and learning about rocket technology. D. Scientists exclusively focus on creating mysterious and colorful liquids that give off clouds of smoke. Correct Answer: C. Scientists engage in a variety of experiences, including wildlife conservation, studying seismic activity, and learning about rocket technology. Explanation: The article describes the author's experience in Costa Rica, which involved participating in several scientific activities outside of a traditional laboratory setting. These activities include working with conservationists to preserve wildlife, studying seismic activity at Mount Arenal, and learning about new rocket technology for the international space station. This illustrates that a scientist's work is diverse and can involve a wide range of experiences, going beyond the common stereotypes of lab coats and mixing chemicals."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What key details about juju mob can be extracted from the following bio?

One (which also applied to reconnaissance flights) was money. A Predator cost about 3 million. If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes, it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force, but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it; the CIA disagreed. Second, Tenet in particular questioned whether he, as Director of Central Intelligence, should operate an armed Predator.\\" This was new ground,\\"he told us. Tenet ticked off key questions: What is the chain of command? Who takes the shot? Are America's leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this, going outside of normal military command and control? Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA, he and the Agency's executive director, A. B.\\" Buzzy\\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he. Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work. It had been built to hit tanks, not people. It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision. In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle. White House officials had seen the Predator video of the \\"man in white.\\" On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system. He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1. Question: \\"Why was Tenet appalled?\\" Response: \\"Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. It merely restates the fact that Tenet was appalled but does not explain why. Allow me to provide a more detailed answer. George Tenet, then-Director of Central Intelligence, was appalled at the idea of using armed Predators for several reasons. The operation of an armed drone by the CIA raised numerous concerns, which Tenet questioned: 1. Chain of command issues: The proposal to use armed Predators raised questions about the chain of command. Traditionally, such operations were carried out by the military, not the CIA. Tenet was unsure who would be responsible for making decisions and ultimately taking the shot. 2. Role of the CIA: Tenet questioned whether the CIA should be involved in operating armed drones, as this was a departure from its usual intelligence-gathering activities. Venturing into direct military operations had potential geopolitical and legal implications that were not fully understood. 3. Technical challenges: The Hellfire missile carried by the Predator was designed to target tanks, not individuals, so adapting it for counterterrorism operations required significant modifications. Additionally, in the existing configuration, the missile would not be capable of hitting moving targets, reducing its effectiveness in certain situations. In summary, George Tenet was appalled at the prospect of the CIA operating armed Predators due to concerns about the chain of command, the CIA's role in such operations, and technical challenges of using the Predator for counterterrorism missions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Is 25 million more going to be enough in a state like Wisconsin? Hypothesis: 25 million is plenty of money for a state such as Wisconsin. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to determine if the premise necessarily leads to the conclusion stated in the hypothesis. Premise: Is 25 million more going to be enough in a state like Wisconsin? Hypothesis: 25 million is plenty of money for a state such as Wisconsin. Analyzing the premise, we get an inquiry about whether 25 million would suffice for a state like Wisconsin. It doesn't contain any explicit or implicit affirmation about the sufficiency of the amount, it's merely a question. Looking at the hypothesis, it assumes an affirmative answer to the premise question, saying that 25 million is a substantial amount for Wisconsin. Now, the hypothesis under consideration isn't necessarily deduced from the premise since the premise doesn't provide any affirmation or support to the assertion made. The premise is neutral—posing a question, while the hypothesis jumps to a conclusion—that 25 million is sufficient.

Write an ordered list of reviews about \\"1073037-hunchback of notre dame\\".","completion":"\\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" by Victor Hugo is a well-known literary masterpiece that has captured the hearts and minds of readers for centuries. The novel, published in 1831, delves into themes of love, redemption, and social injustice, all set against the backdrop of 15th-century Paris. From theatrical plays to musical adaptations, the story of the deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo and the beautiful gypsy, Esmeralda, has taken on various forms, enchanting audiences through differing perspectives. Here is an ordered list of reviews for the novel \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" (ISBN: 1073037). 1. Classic Literature Review: 5/5 Stars \\"Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is a timeless classic that explores themes just as relevant today as they were in the 19th-century. The author's description of Gothic architecture and the Cathedral of Notre Dame itself not only serves as the backdrop for the story but breathes life into the narrative, making it a character of its own. The depth of each character's backstory and their development are evidenced in Hugo's entrancing writing style, ultimately creating a captivating experience for the reader.\\" 2. Historical Fiction Enthusiast: 4.5/5 Stars \\"As a fan of historical fiction, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' offers an exceptional glimpse into the societal norms and political climate of 15th-century Paris. Victor Hugo's detailed and picturesque descriptions of the city transport the reader back in time while connecting current themes with past events, underscoring the cyclical nature of human experience. My only critique is the occasional lengthy digression, which can disrupt the flow of the story.\\" 3. Broadway Buff: 3.5/5 Stars \\"Having seen and enjoyed the musical adaptation of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame,' I was eager to read the source material. While I appreciated the vivid imagery and captivating narrative of the original, it is markedly darker than its theatrical counterpart, as some of the characters' motivations and relationships are significantly different. Though I found certain passages to be dense and slow-moving, it remains an essential read for those who are interested in the inspiration behind the stage adaptation.\\" 4. Romance Novelist: 4/5 Stars \\"As someone who appreciates a good love story, 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' does not disappoint. Hugo masterfully weaves a tale of forbidden love, passion, and sacrifice against the backdrop of socially-sanctioned prejudice. The complex relationships between the characters are what truly drive the plot, as their impossibly tangled destinies come together to form a tragic romance that has continued to enchant readers for centuries.\\" 5. Philosophical Bookworm: 5/5 Stars \\"Victor Hugo's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is a literary feast for those who are drawn to deep, philosophical themes. The novel explores the human condition, the nature of beauty and deformity, and the corruptibility of power, all interwoven into an intricate narrative that challenges preconceived notions of morality. The allegorical elements of the story make it an essential selection for readers seeking a transformative experience.\\" In summary, \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" is a timeless literary classic that has appealed to generations of readers, from fans of historical fiction to theater enthusiasts. Its depth of character and poignant exploration of societal themes make it a must-read for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the world of 15th-century Paris, as told through Hugo's captivating prose."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: Jimbo knows that his marble has a lesser mass then his rock.

Please answer the following question: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does Pres Trump feel about the tariffs?

In a shocking turn of events, the Yankees quite literally \\"dropped the ball,\\" further destabilising their winning chances on the field. In the early innings, the Yankees displayed tenacity and focus, a promising start that had fans on the edge of their seats. They held fast to their strategic gameplay, focused on securing a much-needed victory. Yankees players knew the value of building up momentum in a high-stakes game. As the innings progressed, a sudden dip in confidence and teamwork further complicated matters. With the fervent support from the crowd, the Yankees tried to preserve their unsullied reputation and past victories by maintaining the upper hand. However, misfortune struck when a seemingly simple catch was botched in a pivotal moment. This costly mistake was both unexpected and consequential, disrupting the team's harmony and causing a drop in morale. The tension was palpable as they struggled to recover their composure, grappling with the disbelief and disappointment now casting its shadow on the field. The opposition seized this opportunity, capitalizing on the Yankees' fumble and harnessing the newfound energy. As the game continued, the Yankees struggled to regain the momentum they once had, grappling with the knowledge that their performance had faltered. The fans, too, were heartbroken by the team's inability to recover from this mishap. The support continued to pour in, but the earlier enthusiasm had been dampened, as all attempts to ignite the Yankees' fading momentum were met with challenges. Ultimately, the Yankees were unable to regain their footing, burdened by the weight of the dropped ball. A sense of defeat lingered in the air as they walked off the field, reflecting on the game and the hard-earned lessons they would carry into their future confrontations. In the world of sports, a single moment has the potential to change the course of a game – in this case, the Yankees' ball drop shook their momentum, but it also served as a humbling reminder of the highs and lows of competition. The team's fortitude and determination will be tested in the upcoming games, and only time will tell if they can bounce back from this disheartening loss."},{"prompt":"Question: Given the following passage \\"The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962.

The reason for this inference is as follows: Aktar-Ul Islam (born 1980) is a renowned English chef, known for his outstanding culinary skills and accomplishments in the restaurant industry. In 2009, he gained significant recognition when his Indian restaurant, Lasan, was awarded the title of \\"Best Local Restaurant\\" by renowned chef Gordon Ramsay on Channel 4's \\"The F Word.\\" Two years later, Aktar-Ul Islam further solidified his reputation in the culinary world when he emerged victorious in the fish course category during the final of the BBC Two series \\"Great British Menu.\\" This event took place in June 2011. To determine whether this victory occurred more than 1001 days ago, we need to calculate the total number of days that have passed since June 2011. Here's a breakdown of the calculation: As of June 30, 2021, a total of 10 years has elapsed since June 2011. In those 10 years, there have been: - 8 non-leap years (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020) with 365 days each - 2 leap years (2016, 2020) with 366 days each Using this information, we can calculate the total number of days that have passed: (8 non-leap years * 365 days) + (2 leap years * 366 days) = 2920 + 732 = 3652 days. Since 3652 days have passed since June 2011, it is evident that Aktar-Ul Islam's fish course victory in the \\"Great British Menu\\" occurred more than 1001 days ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

Europe's high-speed rail is so successful that one airline is considering getting into the business. More travelers now connect London and Paris by train than by air -- and high-speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future. Eurostar, a joint service of the Belgian, British and French railways, is the speedy passenger train that zips you (and up to 800 others in 18 sleek cars) from downtown Paris to downtown London more easily than flying. Direct Eurostar service from London to Brussels also takes 2.5 hours. The actual tunnel crossing is a 20-minute, black, silent, 100-mile-per-hour nonevent. Your ears won't even pop. Air France will use the same tracks, but says its trains could run faster than Eurostar's (a claim that OPTIONS: - Air France disputes). - Belgian disputes). - Big Ben disputes). - British disputes). - Brussels disputes). - Eiffel Tower disputes). - English Channel disputes). - Europe disputes). - Eurostar disputes). - French disputes). - London disputes). - Paris disputes). - Tribune Media Services disputes).","completion":"- Eurostar disputes). As the story comes to an end, Eurostar disputes Air France's claim that its trains could run faster than theirs. This sparks a healthy competition between the companies, encouraging innovation and improvements in high-speed rail technology for both. The increasing rivalry not only benefits the transportation industry but also ensures that travelers can enjoy faster, more efficient, and cost-effective travel between major European cities. Ultimately, Europe's investment in its infrastructure pays off as high-speed rail services continue to attract more passengers, connect major cities more efficiently, and enhance the overall travel experience for countless individuals across the continent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life.

Sentence 1: Kathryn Harrison's status as voodoo doll has nothing to do with the actual merits or failings of her book, but is entirely owing to how economically her case concentrates the fears, resentments, misconceptions, and idiocies prevailing right now. Sentence 2: Kathryn Harrison's status as voodoo doll is very surprising Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences discuss Kathryn Harrison's status as a voodoo doll, they present different perspectives on the situation. Let's break down both sentences to understand this better. In the first sentence, the author presents a cause-and-effect explanation for Kathryn Harrison's status as a voodoo doll. The author argues that her status is not related to the actual quality of Harrison's book; rather, it is a result of the current climate of fears, resentments, misconceptions, and idiocies. It is a detailed explanation of the situation, mentioning various external factors responsible for her status and dismissing the possibility of her book's merits or failings being responsible. On the other hand, the second sentence states that Kathryn Harrison's status as voodoo doll is \\"very surprising.\\" There is no explanation provided for why the author finds this situation surprising, nor does the sentence discuss any factors contributing to her status. It simply expresses the author's astonishment or bemusement about her status as a voodoo doll. In conclusion, the second sentence does not follow from the first sentence, as it does not contain any logical connection that would support or confirm the statement made in the first sentence. While both sentences discuss Harrison's voodoo doll status, they do so in very different ways - one provides a detailed explanation and the other expresses surprise - without establishing any causal relationship between the two."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Maybe there should be block grants to the states that would enable them to give a tax break to every white teen-ager in America who buys a high-quality handgun. Does it follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\" This statement seems to be introducing a specific type of firearm (AK-47) as the required weapon for the proposed scheme, which was not part of the original proposition. The original proposition mentioned a tax break for every white teenager who purchases \\"a high-quality handgun.\\" There are several reasons for this assertion: 1. Definition of Handguns: AK-47s are not considered handguns. They are categorized as assault rifles due to their design, magazine capacity, and overall firepower. A handgun, typically a pistol or revolver, is designed for easy carry and use with one hand. 2. Objective of the Proposal: The original proposition talks about a potential block grant system that states could use to offer tax breaks to white teenagers who purchase a high-quality handgun. The focus appears to be on promoting responsible gun ownership and potentially supporting local businesses selling such firearms. There is no explanation of why the proposed gun for tax breaks should be an AK-47, an assault rifle used primarily for military and tactical situations. 3. Legality: In the United States, federal law regulates the sale and possession of firearms. The 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, did restrict the manufacture and sale of newsemiautomatic assault rifles like the AK-47 in the United States. Some states have continued to maintain or implement their own specific laws concerning assault rifles, making it more complex to mandate a specific type of firearm for a proposed tax break initiative. 4. Safety and Public Perception: Creating a policy that encourages teenagers to purchase and possess assault rifles could be seen as promoting a dangerous environment and increasing the risk of gun violence. There is already considerable debate around gun control and the prevalence of firearms in the United States. Implementing a policy that supports the acquisition of powerful firearms like AK-47s among teenagers may exacerbate existing problems and generate backlash. 5. Unfairness and Discrimination: The original proposition suggests tax breaks for only white teenagers, which raises questions of racial equity and fairness. Policies that provide benefits to one specific racial or ethnic group over others can create divisions and perpetuate discrimination, further exacerbating existing societal tensions. In conclusion, it does not follow that \\"The guns that allow the tax breaks for teenagers should be AK-47s.\\" The proposal's original focus was on high-quality handguns, and introducing AK-47s as the required weapon does not align with this focus. Furthermore, promoting possession of assault rifles among teenagers could raise legal, safety, and fairness concerns, making the suggested policy change problematic in several aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium? After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter.

Samantha understood the importance of maintaining a responsible and controlled environment where everyone could enjoy themselves without anyone getting hurt, either physically or emotionally. She was aware of the risk of driving under the influence, alcohol poisoning, or even the impaired decision-making abilities that come with drunkenness. All these factors could lead to dire consequences, ranging from damaged friendships to accidents and legal problems. Samantha tactfully approached Cynthia and took the glass away from her.

She organized a variety of games, including a friendly competition of charades, an impromptu karaoke session, and a dance-off. As it turns out, the games were a huge hit, and everybody fully immersed themselves in the fun without feeling the need to rely on alcohol as a means to relax or have a good time. In addition to the engaging activities, Samantha was diligent in ensuring that there was a constant supply of delicious food for guests to nibble on as they mingled and joined in the various games. This approach also played a significant role in curbing excessive alcohol consumption, as people had something else to keep their hands and mouths occupied.

With Vince Young recovering from a quad injury, back-up QB Kerry Collins was given the start. In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood with kicker Rob Bironas getting a 52-yard field goal. The Texans would respond with LB DeMeco Ryans returning a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Titans answered with Bironas kicking a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Tennessee began to pound away as Bironas got a 21-yard field goal, while RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Bironas would end the half with a 30-yard and a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Titans continued its domination with Bironas kicking a 43-yard field goal, while rookie RB Chris Henry got a 4-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Houston began to rally as QB Sage Rosenfels completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR David Anderson and a 6-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. Afterwards, Tennessee managed to reply. With Bironas' 29-yard field goal, he became the 5th kicker in NFL history to get 7 field goals in one game. However, the Texans managed to retake the lead with Rosenfels completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Jeb Putzier and a 53-yard TD pass to WR Andr&#233; Davis. Fortunately, the Titans managed to get a historic last-second field goal. With his 29-yard field goal, not only did it seal the win for Tennessee, but it made Rob Bironas the first kicker in NFL history to get 8 field goals in one game. How many yards long, to 1 decimal place, were Rob Bironas' field goals on average in the first half?","completion":"To calculate the average length of Rob Bironas' field goals in the first half, we will first identify the lengths of each field goal, sum them up, and then divide by the total number of field goals.

The sentence, \\"but, like silence, it's a movie that gets under your skin,\\" is likely suggesting that the film has a profound or deep impact on the viewer. Just like silence, which can be deep, peaceful, contemplative, or profoundly moving, the movie is presented as something that penetrates deeply into your feelings or thoughts. The phrase \\"gets under your skin\\" is often used to denote something that strongly affects you, in a way that it makes you think about it or feel it, especially when it is not immediately apparent. It can be used in both negative and positive contexts, however, in a movie review, it's typically considered as something positive. It suggests a successful engagement and emotional investment that a viewer has towards the movie. However, we must bear in mind that without further context or a complete review, the assessment can slightly shift. For instance, if the full review described the film as depressing, frustrating, or anxiety-inducing, then \\"gets under your skin\\" might have a negative connotation. In this specific context given, it leans more towards a strength of the movie, hence it is perceived as a positive review.

Movie plot title: After the Sunset Movie plot: After the Sunset begins with master thieves Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), retiring to Paradise Island in the Bahamas after one last big score, having lifted the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds. Their financial future is set, their career in crime a thing of the past. However, Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), the FBI agent who has spent seven years doggedly pursuing Burdett, only to be foiled time after time, refuses to believe their retreat into domesticity. After a few months, Lloyd shows up, accusing Burdett of hiding out in the same place where a cruise ship is displaying another large rare diamond, the third of a set of diamonds that he stole. He thinks the two are planning to lift the third Napoleon diamond, one of the three largest non-flawed diamonds in the world.When the two adversaries meet up in paradise, Burdett unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. Despite his pleas of innocence and placing Lloyd in first-class accommodations to show how he doesn't need to steal anything, Burdett's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts casing the ship. However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Mooré (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.Burdett pretends to work with Mooré, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan).

That's because (A) the saran wrap is thinner (B) the toilet lid is thinner. What is the most sensical answer between \\"saran wrap\\" and \\"toilet lid\\"?","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"saran wrap\\" and \\"toilet lid\\" is (A) the saran wrap is thinner. Here's a detailed explanation of why: In the short story, Sue first wraps saran wrap over the bowl of her toilet and drops a potato in the middle of it. The potato falls straight through, which indicates that the saran wrap is not capable of supporting the weight of the potato. The most likely reason for this is due to the saran wrap's thinness and its relative lack of strength. Saran wrap is made from plastic and is designed to be thin and flexible, mainly for food preservation purposes. Its primary function is to create an airtight seal to protect the freshness of food, not to provide support against heavy objects like a potato. On the other hand, when Sue conducts the experiment again with the toilet lid down, the potato bounces harmlessly off the lid. Toilet lids are usually made from a much more robust material, such as plastic or wood, and are designed to be thicker and stronger than saran wrap. The primary function of a toilet lid is to cover the toilet bowl, providing support and acting as a barrier when not in use. Due to its thickness and the materials used, the toilet lid can withstand the force of the dropped potato, preventing it from falling through. Considering the properties and functions of both materials, it is far more logical to conclude that the reason the potato falls through when the saran wrap is used and not when the toilet lid is used is that the saran wrap is thinner and less robust. Hence, the most sensical answer is (A) the saran wrap is thinner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A vocabulary, usually developed with age, serves as a useful and fundamental tool for communication and acquiring knowledge. Acquiring an extensive vocabulary is one of the largest challenges in learning a second language. - Western philosophy is the philosophical thought and work of the Western world. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of Western culture, beginning with Hellenic (i.e. Greek) philosophy of the Pre-Socratics such as Thales (c. 624 c. 546 BC) and Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC), and eventually covering a large area of the globe.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - It is a major competitor of the St college in Tokyo known as Komazawa University. Despite the university's sectarian affiliation, the school accepts Soto students. The school operates two research centers important in Zen academia, i.e. the Institute for Zen Studies and the International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism. Founded in 1872 as a seminary for those interested in the priesthood, the university carries on that tradition while offering an education to those uninterested in becoming a priest.

Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (7941185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly.

An openly gay former Dominican friar insisted today that homosexuality is the ‘ticking time bomb in the Catholic Church’ and that homosexual men are ‘massively over-represented’ within the Church. Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic suggested that at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay. His comments came as the former leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, said the scandal-hit Catholic Church must undergo renewal and reform. Scroll down for video. Former friar: Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic had suggested at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay. Mr Dowd told CNN: ‘When you have this culture of secrecy and guilt and repression, you have conditions which foster the potential for blackmail and for manipulation. ‘This is a very unhealthy stage for the church, because basically when you have secrecy, you have lies - and when you have lies, people often are put in terrible pressures of being compromised.’ Meanwhile, the Cardinal said the successor to Benedict XVI would need to be able to tackle reform of the Roman Curia, the Vatican departments which govern the 1.2billion-strong global church. Last weekend Italian newspapers published claims of homosexuality and blackmail within the Church, with one allegation centering around a secret ‘gay cabal’ of priests, reported CNN. But veteran Vatican journalist Marco Politi said this idea was ‘rubbish’, adding: ‘Here in the Vatican, there are monsignors who have love affairs, with women and with men. But they hide it.’ Mr Dowd added: ‘I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life. There's nothing wrong with that. Vatican: Italian media ran a series of stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year. ‘The problem is that a lot of them are told that they are intrinsically unhealthy according to church teaching. And that's not a very appropriate state of affairs if we're talking about psychosexual health and emotional maturity.’ 'I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life' Mark Dowd, former Dominican friar. Earlier this week Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Italian media ran stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year. Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. He was jailed and later pardoned by the pope. The documents alleged corruption in the Vatican and infighting over the running of its bank, which has been at the heart of a series of scandals in past decades. But the Vatican said the Italian media had spread 'false and damaging' reports and claimed it was an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Mark Dowd, an openly gay former Dominican friar and journalist, claims that homosexuality is the \\"ticking time bomb in the Catholic Church\\" and that homosexual men are \\"massively over-represented\\" within the institution.

To analyze this, let's break down the information given in the original sentence: 1. Small children are involved. 2. These children are wading through shallow waters. 3. The waters are present due to the flooding of the street. In the original sentence, there is no mention of the children's emotional state or whether they are enjoying the situation. However, it is reasonable to assume that wading through shallow waters could be an enjoyable activity for children, as it is a common sight in various recreational settings (e.g., beaches, pools, or even rain puddles). However, it must be noted that this is only an assumption, and thus not a definitive confirmation. The enjoyment of children in the situation may be likely, but it is not explicitly stated. The sentence \\"Children are enjoying the flooded streets\\" could be true based on what is implied within the context of the original sentence, but without more information, it cannot be conclusively said that it is an absolutely true statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. - Pomerania-Stolp was one of the partitions of the Duchy of Pomerania. Centered in Supsk, it was created from another partition of the Duchy of Pomerania, Pomerania-Wolgast, to satisfy Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania in 1368, and existed until 1459, when it was inherited by Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1474, it was merged to the partition of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania, who four years later became the sole duke of Pomerania. - Lower Saxony is a German state (\\"Bundesland\\") situated in northwestern Germany and is second in area, with , and fourth in population (8 million) among the sixteen \\"Länder\\" of Germany.

None of the partitions had a hereditary character, the members of the House of Pomerania inherited the duchy in common. The duchy thus continued to exist as a whole despite its division. The only exception was made during a war with the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when in 1338 Barnim III of Pomerania-Stettin was granted his partition as a fief directly from the Holy Roman Emperor, while Pomerania-Wolgast remained under formal Brandenburgian overlordship. However, already in 1348, German king and later emperor Charles IV again granted the Duchy of Pomerania as a whole and the Principality of Rügen as a fief to the dukes of both Pomerania-Stettin and Pomerania-Wolgast, nullifying Brandenburg's claims by granting Imperial immediacy.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: CBC Radio 3 is a radio network that consists of two parts devoted to Canadian arts and music: a radio service which is available on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and streaming audio, and several daily and weekly podcasts from the CBC Radio 3 website. The audio stream is available from both CBC Music and from iTunes Radio, but geographical restrictions are in place to prevent access outside of Canada. The network evolved out of programming on CBC Radio 2, which also simulcasted the satellite network on Saturday and Sunday nights from its debut in December 2005 until March 17, 2007. Radio 3 is no longer heard on terrestrial radio, but is still available through its satellite radio and Internet operations. From 2005 to 2009, the Icecast stream available from the network's website was not a simulcast of the satellite radio broadcast, but was programmed separately. Initially, the webstream consisted exclusively of music with the occasional identification break, but on September 14, 2007 it was relaunched with hosts and feature content, similar to but still programmed separately from the satellite radio station. Due to funding cuts, however, the two services were merged in June 2009, such that the webstream is now a straight simulcast of the satellite radio channel. Prior to the merger, the two services had slightly different programming strategies - the satellite radio station aired a music mix of 85 per cent Canadian and 15 per cent international, while the web service's mix was 100 per cent Canadian. With the merger of the two services, the station announced that the program mix would be 100 per cent Canadian music on both platforms, although exceptions will be permitted for international music with some Canadian character - such as international artists covering Canadian songs, collaborations between Canadian and non-Canadian artists, international artists appearing on the bill with Canadian artists when the network is airing a live concert, or \\"honourary [sic] Canadian\\" artists such as Neko Case and Rose Melberg. In February 2009, CBC Radio 3 participated with Exclaim! and aux.tv to launch X3, a new collaborative cross-promotional platform which sees all three outlets air feature content spotlighting a particular \\"Artist of the Month\\". X3 artists of the month have included K'naan, Malajube, Thunderheist, Japandroids, Apostle of Hustle, The Rural Alberta Advantage, Owen Pallett, and Jenn Grant. In addition to the service's conventional radio programming, any song in the network's music library can also be played on demand from the artist's profile page on the site. In May 2011, Joel Plaskett became the first artist in the network's history to reach one million on-demand plays. In 2012, CBC Radio 3 was integrated into the new CBC Music service. Did they do any webcasts after Icecast?","completion":"Yes, after the Icecast stream, CBC Radio 3 continued with webcasts. As stated in the article, \\"on September 14, 2007 it was relaunched with hosts and feature content, similar to but still programmed separately from the satellite radio station.\\" This indicates that they continued with webcasts even after the Icecast stream was no longer exclusively programmed separately from the satellite radio broadcast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\", answer the following question.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident.

The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies.

Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \\"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of human population movements that do not result in all human populations being independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian populations. How much human genetic diversity exists in a single African population? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"According to Long and Kittles in their 2003 paper, about 100% of human genetic diversity exists in a single African population. This is because Africa is considered to be the ancestral birthplace of modern humans, and therefore consists of the most diverse set of human genes. It is important to note that the percentages of genetic diversity mentioned in their paper are based on their findings and interpretation of human population history and relationships. As research continues, these numbers might vary, but their findings still highlight the high level of genetic diversity within African populations compared to other groups around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They study hard and do extremely well on achievement tests. And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education. The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert. \\"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\\"No matter what,though,\\"states Lipscomb,\\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\\" Question: The writer thinks _ .

But for Adrienne White, seven field seasons along the northern reaches of Ellesmere Island give the numbers real-world immediacy. They all retreated. Nothing is growing. - Adrienne White, University of Ottawa glaciologist \\"I've been actually able to see with my own eyes, to the point where there were some areas I couldn't recognize between years,\\" said White, a University of Ottawa glaciologist. \\"One year you're Ski-Dooing over the ridges of these ice shelves, and then you go back the year after and [it's] like a city of icebergs.\\" White has catalogued and studied the condition of more than 1,700 glaciers on the High Arctic island, both on the ground and from satellite imagery. She looked at glaciers on land and flowing into the ocean as well as at ice shelves floating on top of the sea. Out of 1,773 glaciers, 1,353 shrank significantly between 2000 and 2016. All of them shrank a little bit, said White. \\"What I saw when I was measuring was 100 per cent of glaciers retreating,\\" she said. \\"They all retreated. Nothing is growing.\\" White found glaciers lost more than 1,700 square kilometres. That's a loss of almost six per cent over a period of 16 years. Most of these glaciers probably aren't coming back. Glaciers not accumulating snow The Canadian Arctic is experiencing some of the fastest climate warming anywhere on Earth. The annual average temperature on Ellesmere Island has increased by 3.6 degrees. Data from other points in the Arctic suggest rising temperatures mean the elevation needed for snow to last through the summer has risen by 300 metres. White found most of Ellesmere's glaciers are no longer high enough to accumulate snow. \\"I don't see snow surviving throughout the summer,\\" she said. \\"You need that year-long snow to be able to accumulate and create more ice and I just don't see that. An iceberg floating in the Baffin Bay above the Arctic Circle dwarfs the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Louis S. St-Laurent on July 10, 2008. (Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press) \\"Over 50 per cent of the glaciers are completely in the ablation zone, [where] 100 per cent of the glacier area is undergoing melt. No part of that glacier is creating more ice.\\" White's work echoes earlier research that found Ellesmere's glaciers began shrinking several decades before her study began. Although she's not able to say whether that retreat is speeding up, the rate of warming is increasing. Until the mid-1990s, the average temperature climbed about 0.12 degrees per decade. From 1995 to 2016, the increase was 0.78 degrees per decade. It's hard to say what the consequences of shrinking glaciers will be, said White. There will be some impact on sea-level rise and the melting ice is likely to release more and larger icebergs into the water, she said. Little is known about the area, which is so remote that until recently it couldn't even be found on Google Earth. One thing is certain, though, said White. \\"It is a big change.\\" ||||| Hundreds of glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are shrinking and many are at risk of disappearing completely, an unprecedented inventory of glaciers in the country’s northernmost island has revealed. Using satellite imagery, researchers catalogued more than 1,700 glaciers in northern Ellesmere Island and traced how they had changed between 1999 and 2015. The results offered a glimpse into how warming temperatures may be affecting ice in the region, from glaciers that sprawl across the land to the 200-metre thick ice shelves, said Adrienne White, a glaciologist at the University of Ottawa. “It’s an area that’s very difficult to study,” said White. “Logistically it’s very hard to get to and even with satellite imagery – for the longest time Google Earth didn’t even have complete imagery – it was kind of the forgotten place.” Glacier loss is accelerating because of global warming | John Abraham Read more White’s study, published last month in the Journal of Glaciology, found that the glaciers had shrank by more than 1,700 sq km of over a 16-year period, representing a loss of about 6%. A previous study of glaciers in the region – which used air photos and did not include ice shelves – showed a loss of 927 sq km between 1959 and 2000, hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing.

A handful had disappeared altogether: “What we found is a loss of three complete ice shelves,” she said. “In terms of glaciers that terminate on land, we’ve lost three small ice caps.” None of the glaciers in the study showed any signs of growing. The findings echo the changes White has observed during her years of visiting the island. “We see a lot more icebergs,” said White. “Where there was one continuous ice shelf, we now see individual icebergs broken up, we see a lot more crevasses.” She attributed the findings to an increase in temperatures. Canada’s Arctic – one of the world’s most glaciated regions – is warming at one of the fastest rates of anywhere on Earth. In northern Ellesmere Island, the annual average temperature in the region increased by 3.6C between 1948 and 2016. In particular, “there seemed to be a shift in the mid-90s,” she said, describing it as a “sudden increase in warming,” that saw temperatures increase at about 0.78C per decade between 1995 and 2016. “These increases were greatest in autumn and winter,” she said. “So what you end up with is a lot more melt.” While the most direct impact is rising sea levels, the melting ice also risks wiping out the region’s unique ecosystems, such as the freshwater lakes that form when the water flowing off a glacier is trapped by a floating ice shelf. “When these glaciers break away, all of a sudden there’s nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years,” said White. “And they’re gone before we even have the chance to study them.” Extrapolating from research done on glaciers from a neighbouring island, White’s study suggested that many of the glaciers on northern Ellesmere Island may not be high enough to accumulate enough snow to counter the pace at which they are melting. “Without growth, that glacier is just in a state of loss,” she said. “It will disappear if climates don’t change.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Over 1,700 glaciers in Canada’s high Arctic are at risk of disappearing due to climate change, according to research from the University of Ottawa.

American missionary kidnapped in Nigeria Kogi state Police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi says five men kidnapped the woman from her workplace and are demanding a ransom of 60 million Naira (301,500). The Free Methodist Church has identified the woman as the Rev. Phyllis Sortor, a missionary based at the Hope Academy compound in Kogi state. Kogi state is located away from the areas where Boko Haram operates, making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to terrorism. But there is also the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped Sortor, or that she might be sold to another group. Police have not said if they suspect a certain group or band of criminals. Sortor was kidnapped on Monday, Ogunjemilusi said. The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and the FBI have been notified of the incident, the Free Methodist Church said. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. According to her biography on the church's website, Sortor is the financial administrator of Hope Academy. \\"A special friendship with a clan of nomadic Fulani has given Phyllis the opportunity to open additional schools for Fulani children and their parents,\\" the website says. The commissioner said five men scaled the wall of the school where Sortor's office is and \\"whisked her away,\\" jumping back over the wall and fleeing to the nearby mountains. Two of the men were masked, and they fired shots into the air to scare people away during the kidnapping, Ogunjemilusi said.

A single and widowed father, he is particularly strict with his two children, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and Celia (Regine Nehy). As his kids leave for school, the new neighbors begin moving in next door. They are a young interracial couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington), who are recently married and buying their first home. Chrisâs first exchanges with Abel have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chrisâ smoking (which Chris hides from Lisa) and listening to hip hop music. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children are watching. Abel arrives home to see this spectacle and is upset, so he repositions the home security floodlights so they shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. When Chris confronts him, Abel claims that the lights are part of his security system to prevent crime and says that it is a complex process to shut down the system and the lights. Abel attends a housewarming party hosted by Chris and Lisa. He is garrulous but has an edge, and criticizes Chris and his friends for their liberal political and social tendencies. He also exposes Chris' smoking to Lisa, as Chris has been discarding his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. As he leaves, Chris tells Abel that he is starting to take offense to him, but does not plan to move. One evening, they hear noises downstairs, and find the tires of Chris' car slashed. They suspect Abel and call the police. However, because of Abel's status within the LAPD, the arriving officers are unable to do anything.

Plot: Act 1: Bugs Bunny is digging through the ground in search of his favorite treat (carrots, of course) when he inadvertently digs into a hidden underground chamber housing an ancient alien spacecraft. Astonished, Bugs stumbles into the saucer and accidentally activates it, causing the ship's sophisticated AI, \\"CARO-T,\\" to wake up from a long hibernation. CARO-T informs Bugs that the saucer has traveled 3 billion miles and was part of a reconnaissance mission millions of years ago to find a hospitable planet for its creators, the \\"Vegalons.\\" During CARO-T's millennia-long sleep, the Vegalons' home planet was dying, and they had been searching for a new world with signs of intelligent life to call home. Act 2: CARO-T receives an urgent transmission from the Vegalons, who have finally found their way to Earth. Realizing the dire situation, the Vegalons inform CARO-T that they have a device capable of teleporting their entire civilization to Earth. Unfortunately, activating this device would be catastrophic for humans, leading to Earth's destruction. Despite their peaceful intentions, the Vegalons have no other option, and Bugs decides to help them find a more suitable planet to save both species. With CARO-T's guidance, Bugs pilots the saucer, zipping through the galaxy at breakneck speed, visiting various planets, and encountering several strange alien creatures, some friendly, some hostile. During these adventures, Bugs and CARO-T develop an unbreakable friendship. Act 3: After several close calls, Bugs finally learns the importance of cooperation and teamwork. Together, they discover an ideal, uninhabited planet adjacent to the Vegalons' dying world. At first, the Vegalons are reluctant to trust Bugs, but through Bugs' quick wit and charm, he convinces them to try out the new planet. The Vegalons successfully teleport their civilization to the new planet, dubbing it \\"Planet Carotene,\\" in honor of their new hare friend and the AI that saved them. As a token of gratitude, they provide Bugs with the means to instantly return to Earth. With Earth safe and now having become a hero to two species, Bugs Bunny returns home, excited to share his out-of-this-world experience. He lands the saucer, back in the underground chamber, and covers it up — not before making sure to grab a few extra carrots thanks to his newfound intergalactic friends.

His parents were Peggy (nee O'Neill; a dancer and comedian) and Eli Maurice Orowitz. Eugene was the Orowitz family's second child; their daughter, Evelyn, was born three years earlier. In 1941, when Landon was four years old, he and his family moved to the Philadelphia suburb of Collingswood, New Jersey. Context: In 1973, Landon was an episode director and writer for the short-lived NBC romantic anthology series Love Story. In 1982, he co-produced an NBC \\"true story\\" television movie, Love is Forever, starring himself and Laura Gemser (who was credited as Moira Chen), about Australian photojournalist John Everingham's successful attempt to scuba dive under the Mekong to rescue his lover from communist-ruled Laos in 1977. The real Everingham was cast as an extra in the film. Sam's Son was a 1984 coming-of-age feature film written and directed by Landon and loosely based on his early life. The film stars Timothy Patrick Murphy, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Hallie Todd, and James Karen. Karen previously worked for Landon in the made-for-television film Little House: The Last Farewell. After the cancellation of Highway to Heaven and before his move to CBS, Landon wrote and directed the teleplay Where Pigeons Go to Die. Based on a novel of the same name, the film starred Art Carney and was nominated for two Emmy awards. Up through the run of Highway to Heaven, all of Landon's television programs were broadcast on NBC, a relationship of which lasted thirty consecutive years with the network. After the cancellation of Highway and due to a fallout with those within NBC's upper management, he moved to CBS and in 1991 starred in a two-hour pilot called Us. Us was meant to be another series for Landon but, with his diagnosis on April 5 of pancreatic cancer, the show never aired beyond the pilot. Landon also appeared as a celebrity panelist on the premiere week of Match Game on CBS. Question: What is one of Michael Landon's other projects?

Here is a news article: This post contains spoilers for and frank discussion of Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 9 “The Battle of the Bastards.” Leave now if you want to avoid spoilers. In tonight’s episode Game of Thrones presented not one but two epic battles for the fate of Westeros and Essos. Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons squared off against the slavers while Jon Snow and his northernmen fought back against the Boltons. The stakes seemed incredibly high and HBO has been promoting the episode all season as the one to watch out for. But were the stakes actually all that high? A Stark died, sure. But one we hadn’t seen for several seasons and, even when Rickon was a series regular, we hardly saw him at all. All of our “heroes” who faced battle—Jon, Sansa, Tormund, Melisandre, Davos, Daenerys, Grey Worm, Daario, Yara, Theon, and Tyrion—made it out in one piece. The most upsetting story involving death in the episode belonged to Davos reflecting back on Shireen—a death that happened last season. And the deceptive stakes of “The Battle of the Bastards” are part of a larger problem running through Season 6 of Game of Thrones. As many have noted, a recurring theme of Game of Thrones this season is resurrection and rebirth. That’s a reference to not only the literal resurrection of Jon Snow and the fiery baptism (again) of Daenerys, but also the return of many long-lost characters. But those returns partially exist to feed the body count of the season. Osha, the Blackfish, Balon, and, yes, Rickon all came back just to die after very little screentime. The show is banking on our nostalgia for these characters (well, not you Balon) to up the stakes of their deaths. Yes, it does matter when a Stark dies, but Rickon is hardly on the level of Robb, Cat, or Ned. And while it was incredibly gratifying to watch Sansa have her revenge, the death of Ramsay Bolton feels long past due. Gruesome though it may have been, Ramsay’s death didn’t carry the same satisfaction as the death of King Joffrey or moral murkiness of the murder of Tywin Lannister. Then there were the deaths of famous Season 6 guest stars like Essie Davis, Ian McShane and Max von Sydow who seemed to exist just to put familiar faces on corpses we barely know. We also lost several mascots like Shaggydog, Summer, Wun-Wun, and Hodor. Hodor’s death was expertly executed and certainly poignant but, still, he’s never been a fully-fleshed character. Your mileage may vary when it comes to direwolves, but, with the exception of Ghost, the Stark familiars who are so crucial in the books have had hardly ANY screen time in years. And don’t get me started on the assassination of the Martells. More than anything, the death of Doran and Trystane felt like the show trying to wriggle free of a plot that wasn’t working. Those two deaths had zero emotional impact apart from reminding book readers how much better the Dorne plot was on the page. Perhaps all this hollow-feeling carnage can be traced back to the resurrection of Jon Snow—which still feels like it has no enduring consequences in the world of Game of Thrones. We saw Jon go a bit feral as he nearly beat Ramsay to death, but there’s still no indication that he came back wrong. That seemed linked to Rickon more than anything else. Ditto the (admittedly welcome) return of the Hound. Sandor Clegane also doesn’t die in the books, but don’t all these resurrections make death feel cheap in Westeros when once it was the show’s most famous calling card? Game of Thrones became so popular because anyone could die, especially your favorites. But that wasn’t the case tonight. This lack of mortal consequences for the core cast resulted in one of the most unbelievable moments of the season: the miraculous survival of Arya Stark. There is no way she should have endured all those wounds and lived to parkour about it. But unbelievable survival seems to be the new world order on Game of Thrones. There’s still a chance for Game of Thrones to give us some believably high stakes. The finale promises plenty of carnage at King’s Landing—perhaps even some involving characters we actually care about. There’s also the opportunity for the show to pull back a bit from spectacle. Every episode doesn’t have to have a moment that’s meant to drop jaws while leaving our heroes intact. In my opinion, the quieter moments of “The Battle of the Bastards” were truly the best with the triumphant return of the Stark banners to Winterfell and the scene between Davos and Tormund being definite highlights. But those quieter, dialogue rich moments are becoming rarer and rarer on a show that feels increasingly addicted to spectacle. “The Battle of Bastards” (or the Battle of Ice and Fire, as some prefer to call the episode) was certainly “exciting,” but was it satisfying? I guess that all depends on how much you care about Rickon Stark. ||||| Correction appended: June 20, 2016 In a season during which Game of Thrones has been showing its advanced age, “Battle of the Bastards” proved there’s life in the program yet. Season six has, for this viewer, been a bit of a drag, spending its early going noodling around repetitive plotlines (Daenerys getting into a scrape, again, and then breaking free, again; Arya undergoing yet more of her endless training montage before deciding to scotch the whole thing). But “Battle of the Bastards,” occupying the ninth-episode spot in the season when action traditionally reaches its high point, immediately took its place among some of the show’s very best episodes. Dealing first with the Dany plotline—there’s still, six seasons in, a primal thrill to watching her ride her dragons and incinerate her enemies, and her new alliance with Yara raised new and provocative ideas about female leadership—a state of affairs that has precious few precedents on this show. Her getting Yara to promise to change the behavior of her people, and specifically to end the Ironborn’s tradition of rape, continued a motif of challenging patriarchy that was perhaps the only worthwhile takeaway from her captivity and escape. Maybe the reason Daenerys has historically had far more trouble leading than she does conquering is because she’s been forced by circumstance to deal only with male counterparts, and all their flaws. It’s this level of real insight that adds a bit of necessary bite to the image of the would-be queen soaring and burning. As for the show’s centerpiece, the action at the “Battle of the Bastards” between Jon and Ramsay, it’s among the most beautifully shot work in the show’s history. The sequence of Jon facing down a marauding horde all by himself was striking; what followed, a chaotic mess at which the onetime Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch stood untouched, seemingly invincible like some fur-clad cousin of Neo in The Matrix, was remarkable. The battle had at this point already masterfully used the tools of suspense to manipulate us. Rickon Stark, the brother for whose safety Jon was fighting, was commanded by evil Ramsay to run and evade Ramsay’s arrows; having dodged three that the camera closely followed, he seemed safe until a surprise fourth came out of the blue. Jon was therefore fighting a nihilist’s fight. We knew from a crucial (and well-acted on both sides) conversation with Melisandre that he didn’t want to come back if killed, but it seemed almost not to matter whether he died. That among the show’s most elaborate battle sequences ever—with flying horses and a tragically wounded giant—ended in hand-to-hand combat is one of the episode’s crucial ironies. For all the many, many men were implicated in this battle, it came down to two titanic forces of personality, one of whom, Ramsay, was both unwilling and unable to fight fair. Having shot several arrows at an unarmed Jon, he had no defense against his blows. Without the ability to call the tune, Ramsay, for so long (too long) in this show’s run an almost omnipotent supervillain, was impotent, useless. But it wasn’t Jon who had the last word. It was Sansa, whose planning of the battle proved that she’d become not just a realist but a master strategist. Sansa, who just last season was subject to a brutal (and, rightly, controversial) rape scene, was the one to enact bloody revenge, turning Ramsay’s weapons of war, his voracious hounds, back on him. (There was no reason to believe this would work, given the dogs’ loyalty to their master, but for Ramsay’s overzealous bragging that he’d been starving the animals for a week to ensure their hunger.) This was remarkable given that Sansa has not historically been self-assured like Daenerys—it’s almost hard to remember that she began the series a fantasist, obsessed with love and marriage. As she left, Sansa didn’t look triumphant; murder is something only the cruel would celebrate. But granting the crucial moment of victory and reclamation of Winterfell to a female character, one who’s been subject to so much mistreatment before she came into a surprising destiny, was a victory for the show, at least. It took a story that had been repetitive—both repeating itself and resonating, uninterestingly, with age-old tropes—and spun it forward, granting a moment of power to a new sort of heroine. Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described the character Jon Snow. He is the former Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. ||||| RIP Ramsay Bolton, enthusiastic sadist, skilled archer and widely resented Warden of the North. The bastard deserved it. To his long list of crimes against humanity – including gutting his own father, gelding Theon and subjecting Sansa Stark to a hateful campaign of mental and physical abuse – we can add animal cruelty. In anticipation of his showdown with Jon Snow in the frosted fields surrounding Winterfell, Ramsay had neglected to feed his hunting hounds for a whole week. He would have done well to remember that every dog has its day. Game of Thrones recap: season six, episode nine – Battle of the Bastards Read more Before the wintry Battle of the Bastards, though, there was the sunnier undercard: dragons v boats, both hurling great balls of fire. With Meereen under bombardment from the massed fleet of the Masters, the first instinct of newly-returned Daenerys seemed to echo audience impatience – why not just command her dragons to annihilate the armada and raze the Masters’ home cities, a useful trial run for any future King’s Landing invasion? Between pyramid-rattling trebuchet impacts, Tyrion managed to convince the Breaker of Chains not to emulate the blitzkrieg tactics of her forebear the Mad King. Instead, she settled for a strategic victory, inducing her scaly WMDs to barbecue one warship so emphatically the rest of the fleet capitulated. That justified a thrilling sequence of unrestrained dragon flambé, while also allowing Daenerys to take possession of some invaluable warships. (Her armada was bolstered even further after some enjoyably flirtatious deal-making with Iron Islands outcast Yara Greyjoy.) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Agonisingly vulnerable … Jon Snow on the battlefield. Photograph: HBO In an episode otherwise light on laughs, there was at least the sly meta-joke that the Battle of the Bastards debuted on Father’s Day. Despite their mirrored status, Jon and Ramsay knew each other only by reputation – their first real encounter, at a chilly pre-battle parlay with Winterfell in sight, seemed to be a win for Ramsay, on points. He parried Jon’s honourable proposal of a one-on-one duel while smirkingly highlighting his superior numbers. Ramsay’s real ace in the hole was Rickon Stark, whose legitimate claim to Winterfell was also his death warrant. Rickon’s last act was to be the stumbling starting gun for the battle proper, skewered by one of Ramsay’s long-distance arrows but only after luring his half-brother into an agonisingly vulnerable position. There have been massed martial clashes on Game of Thrones before, not least season five’s frantic wildling rout at Hardhome, but this was the most visceral and immersive battle yet. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A connoisseur of exquisite cruelty … Ramsay Bolton. Photograph: HBO Amid a chaotic whirlwind of ringing steel and panicked steeds, the camera closely shadowed Jon as he blundered and bodged his way through a nightmarish slurry of blood, mud and freshly-opened guts. Only an eleventh hour cavalry charge by the Knights of the Vale – reinforcements mustered by Littlefinger at Sansa’s request – saved Jon’s ragged forces from being carved up into anonymous sausagemeat inside Ramsay’s murderous ring of steel. Horrible, violent, seemingly arbitrary death is perhaps the one constant in Westeros. Characters, beloved or otherwise, get removed from the board with frightening regularity and little fanfare. Case in point: after heroically breaching Winterfell, not-so-gentle giant Wun Wun, mortally porcupined by Bolton spears, had his moving death scene cut abruptly short by an arrow through the eye. The show sometimes feels like it goes about its murderous business with the faintly bored air of a professional assassin. But for the routed Ramsay, the end came with an unexpected hint of grand guignol that, as a connoisseur of exquisite cruelty, he would probably have admired in slightly different circumstances. At first, it looked like a berserker-raging Jon was going to keep pounding his skull until Ramsay’s brains were splattered across Winterfell’s courtyard. Instead, he found himself roped to a chair for a final encounter with Sansa, who coolly vowed to wipe out every trace of his legacy. If there was still the faintest smirk detectable in that bloody ruin of a face, it melted away when his starved hounds padded in for their delayed feast. For the audience, such a gruesome execution was deeply satisfying – after King Joffrey’s all-too-abrupt choking fit, here was some cosmic comeuppance for a genuinely loathsome villain. But what’s cathartic for fans might not end up being as useful for the Starks. If retaking Winterfell is supposed to be the launchpad for their comeback, they’re off to a morally muddled start. Sansa is also oblivious to the true cost of her actions: Ramsay’s name might eventually be erased from history, but hers will now forever be associated with barking novelty hit Who Let the Dogs Out. ||||| There was a moment during the Battle of the Bastards, where it seemed like Game of Thrones would do what it always did: kill our heroes. Jon Snow was suffocating under a pile of bodies as his army was surrounded and facing certain death. He struggles to the top of the pile, the camera pans out, and with one beautiful shot you see Snow in the center of a pile of dying men. And there's relief, somehow. This might not end in certain tragedy. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Before it even had a name, GoT showrunners have been selling the Battle of the Bastards as the crowning achievement of HBO's hit fantasy series. There was talk of awards. There were reports on the hundreds of extras, hundreds of hours that went into making the final showdown between Jon Snow and that horrible, sadistic asshole Ramsay Bolton. And Game of Thrones delivered—but in the least Game of Thrones way possible. Above anything else, Game of Thrones—as it was staying true to the books written by George R.R. Martin before Season Six—defined itself as a series that broke every traditional fantasy narrative structure. There was no clear protagonist. It hardly, if ever, produced a truly satisfying moment. The big wins on Game of Thrones were always clouded with moral ambiguity and tragedy. Not tonight. Tonight the good guys won. Tonight, as Ramsay was torn apart by his own pack of dogs while Sansa watched her tormenter die a horrible death, as the knights of the Vale charged in to sweep away the rest of House Bolton, the resolve was clear. Game of Thrones has never delivered such a truly satisfying moment. Yes, poor Rickon Stark was killed before the battle. But this was hardly a surprising tragedy, given Ramsay's intentions. This was anti-Game of Thrones. And purists of the books probably wont like it. Some might call it cliche or cheesy or predictable. But, you can't deny that it was satisfying. In a show where fans have endured so much grief, we can at least have this one win. It might not have been typical Game of Thrones, it might not have been the way Martin would have done it, but we'll still always have this: ||||| This post contains spoilers for and frank discussion of Game of Thrones Season 6, Episode 9 “The Battle of the Bastards.” Leave now if you want to avoid spoilers. There’s no denying that this episode was a huge milestone in the evolution of Sansa Stark. But is she evolving in a direction we want to cheer for? Her inexplicable decision not to tell Jon that she had petitioned Littlefinger to deliver the knights of the Vale when she was calling his strategy against Ramsay into question cost hundreds if not thousands of lives. Many Stark men—and possibly Rickon—died because Sansa couldn’t explain to Jon why she wanted him to wait. The point she makes here is a good one. . . . . .but when Jon offers to listen to her—“all right, tell me, what should we do?”—she withholds vital intel. “It’s not enough but it’s all we have,” Jon says of their smallish force. There was your window, Sansa. It’s true that she may not have known for certain at that moment that Littlefinger would answer her call, but telling Jon that the cavalry was possibly on the way (especially when Tormund mentioned how much Ramsay’s horses put them at a disadvantage) would definitely have altered Jon’s approach. The look on Jon’s face here? That’s the look of someone who would have appreciated this news yesterday, Sansa. In a season that’s been all about the Stark kids returning from exile back into the fold of their House, Sansa has decided that the Stark way is not what she’s interested in. Bran and Arya are headed home and Jon is wearing Ned’s clothes, but, as Sansa was the only one to witness, Ned Stark’s way got him killed. When talking to Jon about the battle plans, Sansa is very Baelish in her demeanor. Ignoring the words of her mother’s house—Family. Duty. Honor.—Sansa treats Rickon like a pawn on the chess board. One she has to sacrifice in order to become queen. She’s not wrong. And when Jon nobly puts his Rickon’s life above strategy (just as, surely, Ned would have), we see that the former Lord Commander not only signs Rickon’s life away, but his own death sentence as well. Were it not for Sansa’s Littlefinger-esque gambit, Jon would have died, honorably, just like Ned. But it might not have come to that at all if Jon was working with all the information. The worst interpretation of events is that Sansa keep the Vale knights a secret for leverage and power. I don’t want to believe it of her, but that’s exactly what Littlefinger would have done. And even more distressing than her Baelish tendencies in this episode were the ways Sansa gave into the Bolton influence. “You can’t kill me,” Ramsay smirks at her, “I’m part of you.” No, this isn’t a reference to Sansa possibly being pregnant. It’s Ramsay telling her that he’s molded and tortured her in his own image. And when Sansa executes him just like he prefers to execute others, she proves him right. The little grin as she walks away is about as far away from Ned Stark as Sansa could possibly get. Ned would have swung the sword, not called the attack dogs. (We’ll go ahead and ignore the fact that Sansa rode off before Ramsay said that thing about not feeding his dogs.) But one theme of the episode is characters doing better than their fathers did. (Happy Father’s Day from HBO!) That’s what Daenerys says to Yara, Theon, and Tyrion. By some definitions—in playing the game and surviving—Sansa is doing “better” than her father did. But at what cost? Surely Bran, Jon, and Arya who are trying to cleave closer to House Stark are on a more traditional path for heroic triumph. Could Sansa’s decision to become more like Baelish and Ramsay spell her doom? Or will Game of Thrones subvert all expectations once again? Added Bonus Book Reader Section Events of last week’s episode poured cold water on the long-standing hope that Lady Stoneheart a.k.a. zombie Catelyn Stark would ever make her TV debut. There are some who have speculated that Sansa would take on this role becoming the soulless agent of Starkish vengeance. And, hey, while it might not happen literally, her grim little smiles in the face of so much death and destruction make her seem pretty flinty of heart. It’s not the fate I wanted for Sansa. As much as she deserves vengeance on her tormenters, sacrificing her humanity is not how I’d want her to get there. Catelyn is undead, but Sansa is still alive—for now. Isn’t there a healthier and more humane way for her to triumph. Shouldn’t she get to win and keep some semblance of the person she once was? Do you have what it takes? Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair ’s Game of Unknowns. Make your predictions ||||| \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is big in the way that only Game of Thrones is big. It’s less epic in its scope than, say, season four’s battle between the Night’s Watch and Wildlings, \\"The Watchers on the Wall\\" (an episode I’ve always found a touch overbearing), but compare it to season two’s \\"Blackwater\\" (featuring the battle for King’s Landing) and it's easy to see just how much the show’s scope has increased. Of course, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" has a leg up on both of those predecessors, because its geography and stakes are 100 percent clear for almost the entire hour. By focusing on a very small battlefield, Game of Thrones is able to give us an episode that captures the chaos of war as well as television ever has. There’s a lengthy unbroken shot (courtesy of director Miguel Sapochnik) of Jon fighting his way across the battlefield, one that underlines just how much of a role sheer luck plays in war. Arrows fly around him but don’t hit him. Swordsman coming to decapitate him are stopped by others. Last-minute saves are the order of the day. And while on the whole, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is perhaps a touch overstuffed — I’m not sure the Dany stuff helped the episode, even though I understand why it’s here — it’s still riveting television and an excellent setup for whatever next week’s finale holds. Here are five winners and six losers from the \\"Battle of the Bastards.\\" Winner 1: Jon Snow Well, obviously. Jon doesn’t just win the titular battle. He also effectively wins a battle against the entire dramatic apparatus of the TV show he lives in. In some ways, Ramsay Bolton is Game of Thrones in a nutshell: nasty, brutish, and willing to kill just about anyone. He’s like the heart of the plot turned into a person, cutting his way across the North. Now, anybody who’s read a story before would likely realize that Jon was going to come out on top of this matchup. But by putting a character who’s essentially Game of Thrones incarnate between Jon and victory, the series gave the battle far more weight than it might otherwise have had. But Jon also earned his win. Yeah, he was saved at the last minute by his half-sister and Littlefinger (more on that in a second), but he kept his troops rallied, even when they were surrounded on all sides by men with shields who were slowly killing all of them. \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" takes careful pains to even depict this literally, as Jon is very nearly trampled by his own men before pulling himself to his feet — at which point the tide of the battle starts to turn. All of a sudden, Wun Wun the giant is throwing around some of Ramsay’s forces and Tormund is taking a nice big bite of an enemy’s throat. Yeah, someone else saves the day, but Jon gets everybody to the point where the day can be saved. (Also: The scene where Jon slowly advances on Ramsay as Ramsay fires arrows into his shield is pretty effective small-scale combat. Nice work, everybody!) Winner 2: The Sansa/Littlefinger alliance This might have been the best Game of Thrones episode for Sansa …ever. She gets to deliver all manner of great lines — I’m particularly partial to her dismissal of Jon saying he’ll protect her — and her decision to contact Littlefinger proves the decision point in the whole battle. It’s like her journey in a nutshell: Women in the world of Game of Thrones can’t count on anybody but themselves. The best you can hope for is to convince a man to drag his army across half a continent for you. For his part, Littlefinger now seemingly controls the largest army in the northern half of the Seven Kingdoms, which makes him as much of a force as he’s ever been. Slowly but surely, he’s been working his way up the ladder of power, and he’s as close to the throne as he’s ever gotten before. Maybe with a strategic marriage… Of course, he’ll clearly try to marry Sansa, and the show is — a bit weirdly — playing Sansa and Jon’s scenes as if they’re a romantic couple waiting to happen. (People keep doubting me on this, but seriously, compare their scenes to the way the season two scenes between Talisa and Robb were shot.) So Littlefinger might be hinging much of his plan on someone who won’t be interested in his affections. But for now, he’s riding high. Winner 3: Daenerys and company After Dany returned from her walkabout to find Meereen under siege, I assumed \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" would feature internecine squabbling among her many influential supporting staff members. But, no. Dany pretty much just tells the Masters they can surrender to her, then uses her dragons and the Dothraki who are loyal to her to retake the city. It’s a pretty easy win for Dany, and she quickly strikes an alliance with the Greyjoys as well, neatly wrapping up a plot that, ultimately, didn’t have much meat on its bones. (Euron proves to mostly be a distraction to chase Yara and Theon across the Narrow Sea.) Dany in full conquest mode might be a little terrifying, but she’s fun to watch. One quibble: When Dany looks back at Tyrion to get his blessing for the alliance with the Greyjoys, it plays as a weird moment. I get why the show does it (Tyrion likely knows more about the Greyjoys than Dany does), but it still feels odd that she would so publicly turn to anybody for advice. Winner 4: Theon and Yara Theon and Yara make their way across the Narrow Sea, seemingly without incident, and they strike a deal with Dany, also seemingly without incident. Yes, Dany makes them promise to give up their people’s thieving, pillaging, and raping ways, but that detail will almost certainly be kindly looked upon by future historians. Also, Yara makes a joking proposal of marriage to Dany. All in all, this is the best week for the Greyjoy siblings in quite some time. Winner 5: The people running the show’s campaign for technical Emmys On every level, \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" is a joy to look at. Yes, Emilia Clarke still looks a little weird when she climbs atop one of her dragons (a special effects problem the show seemingly can’t solve), but that’s my only minor quibble. Everything from the effects work to the hushed din of the battle when all seems lost to the camerawork in that impeccable uninterrupted take feels like the show heading out on the open road and hitting the gas. It’s a series that knows exactly what it’s doing at this point, and though I have my problems with the often lazy filmmaking in other episodes, Game of Thrones always brings its A game when it’s time for a giant battle. Game of Thrones is generally an Emmy favorite, and last year, it won the most Emmys for a show in a single year ever, thanks largely to its technical elements. \\"Battle of the Bastards\\" almost singlehandedly assures that it will win many of those technical categories again. Loser 1: Ramsay Bolton (and his hounds) Okay, the hounds get a nice meal (though one that might give them indigestion), but Ramsay ultimately finds himself the final victim of his own sadism. Rather than face trial and execution, he’s gobbled to bits by the beasts he bred to gobble people to bits, which are unleashed upon him by the woman he raped and assaulted endlessly. Ramsay has been a horrible time suck of a character, with the show only able to play one or two notes with him since he debuted. And even in his final moments — when he smiles as Jon beats the hell out of him, as if he’s enjoying it — he gets to be an eye-rolling irritation. But Iwan Rheon was always good in the part, and in these final moments, he did capture some of how Ramsay always felt small in comparison to the seeming giants around him, and how he overcompensated by playing up his own monstrosity. I’m not sad to see Ramsay or the show’s interpretation of him go (indeed, I’m rejoicing), but I hope Rheon uses this to get some great work elsewhere. Loser 2: Wun Wun the giant JUSTICE FOR WUN WUN! (Seriously, though, going the full King Kong with Wun Wun and having him gradually succumb to a bunch of smaller slights, until he toppled over like a gigantic pincushion, worked far better than it should have for a character whose dialogue has been … let’s say, limited.) Loser 3: Rickon Stark Blink and you might miss the neat irony of \\"Battle of the Bastards.\\" Jon talks about how he must use Ramsay’s need to strike fear into the hearts of the Northmen against him. If he can trick Ramsay into being too brash, he can hopefully gain the upper hand, even though he has far fewer fighting men. But Ramsay’s plan similarly uses Jon’s Achilles’ heel against him: his endless reservoirs of loyalty. When Ramsay looses Rickon and tells the boy to run toward his half-brother, it’s clear something terrible will happen. And it immediately does, as Ramsay begins firing arrow after arrow after the youngest Stark brother. Either he lets Rickon live for four shots to draw Jon out far enough, or it takes four shots for Ramsay to finally bring Rickon down (nicely letting the audience think Rickon might escape by really building up the third shot as the one that will end Rickon’s life). But either way, by that time, Jon is way out past his lines, in the middle of nowhere, seemingly about to be ridden down. His own brashness almost costs his forces the fight, and it’s all because of Rickon, a character I literally couldn’t tell you anything about beyond \\"He’s the youngest Stark.\\" RIP, RICKON. (RIP, SHAGGYDOG, TOO.) Loser 4: The Masters I enjoy how casually Dany dispatches of the Masters, first by burning their ships and overwhelming their forces, then by telling them that one of their little trio must die, before killing the two other than the one selected to be killed, hopefully earning herself some degree of fear and/or loyalty. The Masters — to say nothing of the Sons of the Harpy — have always been one of Game of Thrones’ weaker villains. They seem to arrive whenever the plot deems it convenient, and their actions vary from \\"nuisance\\" to \\"city-shattering force.\\" Plus, the series never gave us a recognizable character on their side, so they functioned mostly as a very well-funded terrorist organization. Anyway, they appear to be done for as well. Goodbye, Masters! Loser 5: Euron Greyjoy (by implication) When Theon and Yara show up in Meereen, they pretty much just show up. We don’t even really get an establishing shot of their ships pulling into the harbor or anything similar. We know they’re going to show up at some point, so they just do. To that end, wouldn’t it be sort of amazing if the show similarly dispatched of Euron? Dany clearly isn’t going to listen to his proposal — which contains a literal proposal — so why not just have Drogon noshing on a human leg next week, then have Yara say, \\"Poor Euron!\\" or something similar? Oh, I’m sure we’ll have to have some sort of naval battle. But, again, Euron is such an ill-defined character that whatever happens won’t have the dramatic weight necessary to really hold its own. Loser 6: Fans of both Game of Thrones and the NBA The final game of the NBA Finals and this episode of Game of Thrones — two events you couldn’t safely ignore without somebody randomly popping up outside of your window to shout spoilers at you — aired opposite each other. There hasn’t been such a difficult sports versus pop culture choice since a football game between the then dominant Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers aired opposite one of the final hours of Breaking Bad. (The game was a disappointment. The Breaking Bad was \\"Ozymandias,\\" one of the greatest TV episodes ever made. So.) Anyway, both episode and game ended up being surprisingly compelling, so I guess everybody wins. But in the moment of making that choice, I can see where you might have felt overwhelmed by the bounty of your options. Tell me what you think in comments. I’ll be by to chat about this episode — and any other pop culture topics you want — at noon Eastern And answer my question for you while you’re at it!

Watch: Game of Thrones' time travel, explained ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In the latest episode of Game of Thrones, titled \\"The Battle of the Bastards,\\" audiences were treated to an epic battle between Jon Snow and his northernmen against the Boltons. However, there were some concerns expressed in regards to the direction of certain character developments and the potential loss of moral ambiguity that initially made Game of Thrones stand out from traditional fantasy narratives. Most notably, Sansa Stark's shift in personality towards being more like Baelish and Ramsay and her decision not to inform Jon about the potential arrival of the Knights of the Vale raises questions of whether these changes will lead to her or other characters' eventual doom or further subvert expectations. The episode also featured Daenerys, Grey Worm, Daario, Yara, Theon, and Tyrion battling against the slavers, leading to a partnership between Daenerys and Yara and the defeat of the slavers. Overall, \\"The Battle of Bastards\\" balanced thrilling action sequences and quieter, emotionally charged scenes, providing viewers with a satisfying victory for the Starks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Robert was very stubborn but Matthew always was willing to compromise, so","completion":"Robert was very stubborn but Matthew always was willing to compromise, so whenever conflicts arose between them, they were able to find a balanced solution that took into account both of their perspectives and needs. In most situations, Robert's stubbornness would lead him to insist on his way and refuse to budge from his position. This could be quite frustrating for those around him, as his unyielding nature would often create tension and impede progress in whatever they were working on together. However, Matthew's patient and compromising attitude played a significant role in diffusing those tensions and leading them to effective resolutions. Recognizing the need for compromise, Matthew would take the initiative to open a dialogue with Robert, inviting him to express his thoughts and concerns, and to listen to his reasons for holding such a strong stance. By displaying genuine empathy and acknowledging the merit in Robert's points of view, Matthew was able to create an environment in which both of their opinions were valued and respected. Once they had shared their perspectives with each other, Matthew would strive to identify areas of common ground and mutual understanding. He would then suggest various potential solutions that satisfied both of their needs, while being flexible and open to suggestions from Robert. By presenting various options and emphasizing their collaborative nature, Matthew would encourage Robert to take an active role in the decision-making process, which would, in turn, make him more receptive to compromise. Robert's stubbornness, although at times difficult to navigate, also had its positive aspects. His unwavering determination often resulted in a strong drive for excellence, pushing both of them to perform at their best. Matthew's willingness to compromise, on the other hand, ensured that their partnership remained balanced, respectful, and productive. This unique dynamic between Robert's stubbornness and Matthew's propensity for compromise ultimately became a source of mutual growth and learning for both of them. They developed valuable communication and problem-solving skills that proved beneficial not only in their collaboration but also in their personal and professional lives. In conclusion, the sentence ends by showing that despite their contrasting personality traits, Robert and Matthew found success in collaborating, thanks to Matthew's remarkable ability to compromise and their collective willingness to work together toward their common goals. Their story highlights the importance of empathy, understanding, and adaptability in overcoming differences and fostering harmonious relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

My wife and I were excited to visit and shop at Chicago's Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave. We chose the Intercontinental Hotel for it's reputation and location. Man oh man, were we disappointed. The check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. We got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. There were six people in line for her and we had to wait. That was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. When we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile, she just pointed to the door and said, \\"It's right out the door.\\" I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, \\"there's no such thing.\\" I couldn't believe her abruptness. We left the concierge stand not wanting to return. Shopping went well and was fun. We returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. We couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. I called the Housekeeping Department and was told, \\"we're all out of directories here in the office.\\" I asked if they could check a vacant room for one. She said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. I hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. Guess what? You guessed it, no phone book in the room. I figured we could go get a drink at The Bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. We went to The Bar and there were only three other customers. We sat at the bar and got our drinks. As I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. He answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. Twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. Tired and hungry, my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut.

Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"where christopher columbus was born?\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa, which is now a part of modern-day Italy. Specifically, he was born in the city of Genoa, a prominent maritime and trade center during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance period. Today, Genoa is the capital of the Liguria region in northwest Italy. Christopher Columbus, also known as Cristoforo Colombo in Italian, was born into a middle-class family in 1451, with his father, Domenico Colombo, being a wool weaver and his mother, Susanna Fontanarossa, taking care of the family. Growing up in the coastal city of Genoa, Christopher developed a keen interest in maritime activities, navigation, and ultimately, exploration. This passion would lead him to embark on numerous voyages across the Atlantic Ocean in search of faster and more efficient trade routes to Asia. Columbus is best known for his 1492 voyage, during which he reached the Americas while seeking a westward route to Asia for Spain. Although he was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas, his voyages are significant as they marked the beginning of widespread European exploration and the eventual colonization of the Americas. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the New World, further exploring the Caribbean and the Central and South American coasts. It is important to note that historical records and documentation from this period are not always complete or accurate, and there have been controversies and debates surrounding Columbus's life and actions. However, based on the majority of historical evidence and consensus among scholars, it is widely accepted that Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa, in what is now Italy."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Idealism: Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called \\"apeirotheism\\", a \\"form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism\\" which he defined as \\"a theory of Gods infinite in number.\\" The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and nous, rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of unmoved movers.

Davidson emphasized that just as Aristotle's concept of soul (the rational, living aspect of a being) could not exist separately from the body, so too could God not exist apart from the world. In his reinterpretation of Aristotle's theology, he posited a pluralistic form of idealism known as \\"apeirotheism,\\" which posits an infinite number of gods. This notion significantly deviates from Aristotle's theology of singular unmoved movers, proposing instead that divinity is correlated directly with rationalism and is pervasive throughout existence.

The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Weslake hides information from his boss about a break-in. After overhearing a plan by Dillard and Ramon, who intend to break into Garvey's pawn shop following the installation of the new alarm system, Weslake is advised by Boardwalk, a pimp, to report the intended robbery to his boss, Garvey. However, Weslake, who fears he may lose his job once the alarm system—the reason for his employment—is installed, decides not to inform Garvey of the planned robbery. Instead, he joins Dillard, Ramon, Boardwalk, and Turtle in their heist attempt, positioning himself as the operation's mastermind and strategizing a plan for the burglary of the pawn shop's large safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"As the per capita income increases, we change to account for predicted alterations in WTP as time goes on.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"As the per capita income increases, we change to account for predicted alterations in WTP as time goes on\\" is essentially a paraphrase of the original sentence. Both statements convey the same idea: that adjustments are made to consider the expected fluctuations in willingness to pay (WTP) as a consequence of increasing per capita income over time. Willingness to pay (WTP) is a crucial concept in economics, as it represents the maximum amount a consumer is willing to spend on a good or service. As per capita income increases, it is normal for individuals to have more disposable income, thereby making them more likely to spend on goods and services. Consequently, businesses and policymakers need to accommodate these expected changes in WTP when making plans and decisions. This can manifest in various forms. For instance, businesses could reevaluate their product pricing strategies, offering different products or services to cater to varying income levels. In this scenario, businesses might want to introduce premium versions of their products or services to attract consumers with a higher WTP. Alternatively, they could provide additional features or improved customer service to enhance the value of their offerings. From the policymaker's perspective, accounting for WTP fluctuations with the rise in per capita income could involve reassessing tax policies or designing programs targeted at different income groups. For example, they could adjust tax brackets to ensure fair taxation based on an individual's ability to pay or develop social programs to encourage economic growth and provide support to those with lower incomes. In conclusion, both statements emphasize the importance of adapting to anticipated changes in willingness to pay over time as per capita income increases. As societies evolve, it is essential for businesses and policymakers to consider these changes to ensure that they continue to satisfy consumer demands and promote economic stability."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food.

The complete answer should include the following information: An earthworm’s food consumption process begins with ingesting soil through its mouth, which contains organic matter. The food travels through the pharynx, where it is lubricated by mucus and then moves to the esophagus. In the gizzard, the soil and organic matter are ground up with the help of the strong muscles and bits of small stones. Then it moves to the intestines, where digestive enzymes and gastric juice break down the organic matter further for digestion.

While driving through the city, an unexpected heavy rainstorm begins, causing Richard's car to break down in a dimly-lit alley. Act 2: As Richard attempts to fix his car, he hears a blood-curdling scream coming from a nearby building. Curiosity gets the better of him, and he decides to investigate. He comes across the body of a young woman who seems to be the victim of a brutal crime. Richard quickly gathers evidence, suspecting that someone from the city's elite is involved. As Richard delves deeper into the investigation, he finds people from the high society who are willing to share information, albeit discreetly. Among them is Elizabeth, a wealthy socialite who is desperate to expose the dark side of her social circle. Act 3: Richard and Elizabeth uncover a pattern of mysterious disappearances among the city's young women, ultimately leading them to a secret society that uses violence and intimidation to maintain their control over the city's political and financial systems. As they get closer to uncovering the truth, the clandestine organization begins to target Richard and Elizabeth, forcing them to fight for their lives. During their investigation, it is revealed that the alley where Richard's car broke down is a crucial location in the secret society's operations. It serves as an unassuming drop-off point for their victims, and the rainstorm that night disrupted the organization's plans, unintentionally placing Richard at the scene of the crime. Act 4: Determined to bring the secret society to justice, Richard and Elizabeth devise a risky plan to expose their criminal activities. Leveraging their newfound allies and their investigative skills, they rally public support and force law enforcement to take decisive action against the secret society's leaders. In the final confrontation, Richard and Elizabeth successfully dismantle the organization, bringing an end to their reign of terror within the city and restoring justice. As the dust settles, the two find solace in each other and decide to continue working together in their quest for exposing the truth hidden within the shadows of society.

Article: Sarah ran in, shouting, \\"Look what I found!\\" Over the top of the paper I was reading; came a terrible thing that caused me to jump. It was a snake skin found in our garden. \\"Isn't it beautiful?\\" said my seven-year-old daughter. I opened my eyes widely and looked at the snake skin in fear . I didn't think it was beautiful, but I learned never to appear nonchalant with children. Everything they see for the first time is important to their sense of beauty; they see only excellence in the world. \\"Why does it do this?\\" Sarah asked. \\"Snakes shed their skins because they need to renew themselves,\\" I explained. \\"Why do they need to renew themselves?\\" Sarah asked. \\"We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,\\" I said to my daughter. \\"We leave some things and find other thing unwanted or unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin. It is probably too little for him, and he probably doesn't think he looks as smart in it as he once did. \\" As we talked, I knew that she began to understand. Although she couldn't understand clearly, she would know that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, our rooms, schoolwork and spirit, and see what we need to keep and what we need to leave. I was careful to tell that this is a natural way, not one to be forced. \\"Snakes don't peel off their skins when they like them. \\"I explained. \\"It happens as a natural thing of their growth. \\" \\"I see, Dad,\\" said Sarah as she held the snake skin, and then ran off. I hoped she would remember this; we need to throw some away because they are worthless or unnecessary. Then we can store them as memories in our deep hearts.

One of the few \\"beer gardens\\" in the Old Town, or Edinbrugh at all (and keep in mind that \\"beer garden\\" is the normal expression for any outdoor drinking area belonging to a pub -- it's not a garden at all, but stone floor with park benches, so don't expect grass, trees or picnic blankets). But it's outside, it gets the sun, and it's really pretty big as far as beer gardens go. Even with the space though, you'll struggle to find a spot at peak hours, as most of Old Town flock here, especially students, after the working day is done (make that 3pm onwards) for an afternoon, sunshiney pint. They show rugby and football on a screen outside, they have outdoor shacks serving hot dogs / burgers in the summer. And attached upstairs / next door is a cool pub doing all sorts of dance nights like swing. So, The Peartree for me is the epitome of Edinburgh summer and Festival season.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Media playback is not supported on this device Other than the odd lesson in PE at high school, I have no real experience of Tennis and I didn't have any particularly strong feelings about it beforehand. In fact, as far as I was concerned, this was a nice, leisurely sport, complete with strawberries, cream and the great British sunshine. Wrong. Firstly, our lesson took place indoors on a chilly, overcast day in Yorkshire (despite the sun always shining in God's own county) and secondly- this is no 'leisurely' sport. From our arrival at the John Charles Centre for Sport (one of the leading venues for disability sport in the UK), it was obvious that this would be no 'easy ride.' On the court opposite, a game of Visually Impaired tennis was taking place with one of the players ranked second in the whole country. Whereas, on our court, we were faced with Nick, who is currently training for a place in the Wheelchair Racing squad at Rio 2016. I don't know how we always end up in these pickles… Hitting the ball is hard enough; let alone hitting it in the right direction, within the correct lines, over the net and on target. Throw in a Serve or two and it's enough to send you into a sporting frenzy! Having said that, I actually really enjoyed the session and could have happily carried on way into the night. I found it really quite addictive and even though I wasn't particularly any good, I was eager to improve and weirdly felt that I had some sort of potential. What's great about Tennis too is that it's accessible to all. It was easy enough for myself and Goz to play together. It's also very flexible in that you can play as a team or as a soloist… I guess dependent on how social you're feeling on the day! Although I have to admit, I do have a new-found respect for Tennis after discovering just how much skill is involved. At professional level, you clearly need a high level of fitness, coordination and tactical intelligence to succeed. However, at an amateur level, this is a really good fun sport that appeals to all ages, genders and abilities. I genuinely really enjoyed myself during the session and am seriously considering this as a sport that I will continue for years to come. Who knows, this might not be the last time you see me with a racket and ball… A friend once said to me that summer does not start until the Cricket season starts. Well not for me, it's all about the tennis! So when I got to see Venus and Serena Williams playing a doubles match in the 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon, then watching Nicholas Taylor (the American player who uses his feet to serve) in the Paralympics at Olympic Park, it was humbling and inspiring and allowed me to think I could at least give it a try. So its more than a bit of an understatement if I said I was looking forward to giving this sport ago. Once we had been put through our paces with a warm up game with some more experienced disabled players. The aim was to stay within the outside tennis court lines, and try not to get caught by the player that was trying to chase you down, a bit like Tag. Then we got a break down of the rules from the coaches, such as the 'two-bounce rule', which means as a disabled player I can allow the ball to bounce twice but must hit the ball before a third bounce. So if I play Andy Murray (in my dreams) he has one bounce, I have two. My disability has affected my body in a way that my strength is diagonal so the top of my body is stronger on the left side and on the bottom part of my body I am stronger on my right side. This means I have always had to work around doing things someone else in a wheelchair may not have to think about. Why do I tell you this? My serve! I can't use my right arm to serve like a pro. I also learnt that you have to be stationary when serving and that the ball cannot bounce before you hit it across the net. What I devised was to balance the ball on the racket, throw it up in the air and before it lands hit it over the net, well that was the plan. So when I finally got it over the net and the opponent player hit it back I felt like a double Wimbledon champion! To round off our lesson we played the game champion, this was where one set of players were champion and everyone else had to beat them to get the tile champion from them. It was the best of three. I don't know what it is but the competitiveness always comes out and the fact is I want to win… No, I need to win! Coach, Ross and myself did win, with no thanks to me. Woooohoooo!

Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers.

Commonly called 'light bulbs', lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture, which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation. While lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption, expressed in watts, proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced. For example, a 60 W incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 W compact fluorescent lamp. Each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light. Visible light output is typically measured in lumens. This unit only quantifies the visible radiation, and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light. A wax candle produces on the close order of 13 lumens, a 60 watt incandescent lamp makes around 700 lumens, and a 15-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces about 800 lumens, but actual output varies by specific design. Rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output, to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp.

Write a summary based on this article: The Navy SEAL killed during combat in Somalia on Friday was Kyle Milliken, 38, a Falmouth native, the Department of Defense announced Saturday. Milliken, a senior chief special warfare officer, was killed during an operation against the terrorist group al-Shabab in Barii, about 40 miles west of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Two other service members were wounded, the Pentagon said Friday. A Press Herald file photo shows Kyle Milliken (seated, front) with the state-record-setting Cheverus High School relay team in April 1998. Also pictured, standing from left, are Ryan Toothaker, Nick Nappi, and Ryan Demers. Staff photo by Doug Jones Related Headlines Navy SEALs one of U.S. military’s most elite forces ‘Advise and assist’ mission took Falmouth SEAL into harm’s way In a statement released through the Department of Defense, the Milliken family thanked the community for its interest but asked for privacy. “He was a devoted father and son, a true professional and a wonderful husband,” the family said. Milliken grew up in Falmouth and graduated in 1998 from Cheverus High School, where he was one of the school’s top track stars. He and three teammates set the record for the 1,600-meter relay for Class A schools in 1998, according to the Maine Principals’ Association. “His former teachers, administrators, coaches and friends pray that eternal rest be granted to him, perpetual light shine upon him and that he rest in peace,” said the Rev. George E. Collins, president of Cheverus. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who represents Maine’s 1st District, which includes Falmouth, said in a statement that Milliken was “an amazing athlete who could do flips on skis and run for miles.” SPECIALIZED IN FREE-FALL PARACHUTING Milliken enlisted in the Navy in 2002 and quickly joined the special operations forces. He underwent special warfare training in Coronado, California, and specialized in free-fall parachuting. He was based out of Virginia Beach, Virginia, starting in 2004. Milliken served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars, among at least 30 medals and commendations. “We were a nation at war when he enlisted,” said Capt. Jason Salata, spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command. “He has four Bronze Stars. You don’t get that from sitting at home. You’re getting those kind of awards for valor.” According to Pingree, Milliken operated for many years with SEAL Team 6, an elite counterterrorism unit. “May we never forget his extraordinary bravery and incredible sacrifice,” Pingree said. Another member of Congress, Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, a former Navy SEAL whose district includes Virginia Beach, described Milliken as a “great friend, family man, and teammate” in a Facebook post Saturday afternoon. The fallen SEAL was “brilliant, witty and fiercely loyal,” Taylor wrote. In a written statement late Saturday night, Gov. Paul LePage expressed condolences from himself and his wife, Ann, to Milliken’s family. “On behalf of all Mainers, to the family and loved ones of Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken, there are no words that may provide comfort during this difficult time, but know he is a man we are forever indebted (to) for his service, sacrifice and protection of the freedoms we hold dear,” LePage said. In a joint statement, U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine said they were deeply saddened to learn about Milliken’s death. “He defended our nation with bravery and with distinction, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten,” the senators said. Milliken was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit that was supporting Somali National Army-led operations. He was the first U.S. service member to die in Somalia since 1993, when 18 U.S. servicemen were killed after two helicopters were shot down over Mogadishu. Among them were two Mainers: Army Master Sgt. Gary Gordon of Lincoln and Army Staff Sgt. Thomas Field of Lisbon. The incident was recounted in the book and film “Black Hawk Down.” “Senior Chief Kyle Milliken embodied the warrior spirit and toughness infused in our very best Navy SEALs,” said Rear Adm. Timothy Szymanski, commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command. “We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments. He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate – and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates,” Szymanski said. “His sacrifice is a stark reminder that Naval Special Operators are forward doing their jobs, confronting terrorism overseas to prevent evil from reaching our shores.” MILITARY TARGETS AL-SHABAB COMPOUND Milliken was killed during a raid Friday on an al-Shabab compound. A firefight broke out after U.S. aircraft delivered Somali troops to the target area and U.S. troops were a distance back from the buildings, The Associated Press reported. The compound was targeted because it had been associated with attacks against U.S. and Somali forces. Al-Shabab militants have been fighting the Somali government and foreign forces for almost a decade and are responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including assaults against civilian targets in Kenya. A Somali intelligence official told the AP that U.S. forces killed at least six people in the raid that targeted a building housing al-Shabab’s radio station and the dead included al-Shabab journalists. The battle comes as the U.S. is intensifying military operations in Somalia. In late March, President Trump authorized expanded offensive airstrikes against al-Shabab and the deployment of dozens of regular troops to the country, the largest deployment in decades. The Pentagon had increased special forces activity and airstrikes in Somalia under President Barack Obama. Somalia has been plagued by civil war since the government was overthrown in the early 1990s. The current national government is supported by the U.S. and an African Union peacekeeping force that is scheduled to leave the country in 2018. Staff Writer Megan Doyle contributed to this report.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Phil McCausland The Navy SEAL killed in Somalia during an operation against terrorist group al-Shabab was identified Saturday as a decorated 15-year veteran. Kyle Milliken, a 38-year-old senior chief special warfare operator from Falmouth, Maine, was killed Thursday in a far-flung area of Somalia — about 40 miles west of the capital of Mogadishu — after he and his team came under fire from al-Shabab fighters. The attackers were \\"neutralized,\\" but Milliken was killed and two others were injured. Kyle Milliken, 38, of Falmouth, Maine. Navy SEAL Rear Adm. Timothy Syzmanksi, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Command, said Milliken \\"embodied the warrior spirit and toughness\\" that represent the Navy SEALS. Milliken was also a member of SEAL Team Six, the elite unit credited with killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, and he earned four Bronze Stars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\"We grieve his death, but we celebrate his life and many accomplishments,\\" Syzmanksi said in a statement. \\"He is irreplaceable as a husband, father, son, friend and teammate — and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and teammates.” Milliken is the first U.S. service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu that led to the death of 18 service members and wounded 73 others — an event that inspired the book and later Hollywood film, \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" Related: Trump’s Army Secretary Pick Mark Green Withdraws Name From Consideration Milliken was part of the operation that had been coordinated between the Somali National Army and U.S. Africa Command. He first joined the Navy in 2002 and was assigned to an East Coast-based special warfare unit as a SEAL. Milliken and two others were injured in Thursday's attack and were medevaced to neighboring Djibouti, but Milliken died of his wounds. While the U.S. military is still analyzing intelligence to find out if the targets of the mission were among the dead, the Somali government declared it a victory. Omar Mohamud Elmi, the deputy governor of the Lower Shabelle region in Somalia, said the aim of the operation was to \\"surgically target\\" two elements: senior members of al-Shabab hiding in the area and a pro-al-Shabab media station. \\"The joint operation, the special operation, has successfully carried out a surgical strike on these two main elements killing many of the terrorists,\\" Elmi said. There are currently 50 American special forces members working in Somalia as part of the African Union mission. They are collaborating with local national commandos to “train and advise,” which is part of a ramped up effort to fight al-Shabab, an al Qaeda-allied group that has imposed Sharia law in areas of the country under its control. President Donald Trump approved the use of aggressive airstrikes and military operations to fight the group last month. |||||","completion":"The US Department of Defense has identified the Navy SEAL killed in combat in Somalia as 38-year-old Kyle Milliken, a Falmouth native.

Caitlyn Jenner could become richer than Kardashians: experts Now it's the Kardashians who will have to keep up with Caitlyn. The former Bruce Jenner’s debut on the Vanity Fair cover on Monday put the Olympic champ turned reality star turned transgender icon in a position to outearn her fellow clan members, experts said. “She could become the wealthiest of them all,” said Rob Shuter, host of VH1’s “The Gossip Table” and former head of Dan Klores Communications. “If Bruce Jenner made 100 million in 65 years, if all the stars align, she could be worth over 500 million in the next five to 10 years. “Caitlyn is going to be a pioneer,” he added. Jenner doesn’t need the dough. Her estimated net worth is 100 million, according to reports on Celebrity Net Worth and The Richest, and she was already pulling in 40,000 for motivational speaking tours when she was known as Bruce. But now people can’t get enough of Caitlyn. Jenner’s “Dateline” interview with Diane Sawyer in April drew 17 million viewers on a Friday night. Her Twitter launch on Monday smashed the record by hitting 1 million followers in just over four hours. “A book deal could hit seven figures. Speeches could garner six figures each,” said Brian Balthazar, editor of Pop Goes the Week, a culture website. On the fashion and beauty front, the 22-page Vanity Fair spread proved Jenner can model couture by Zac Posen, Halston and Donna Karan, but some brands may take a wait-and-see approach before courting her. “The reality of it is, this is still very controversial for a lot of traditional Fortune 100 companies,” said Ryan Schinman, founder of the Platinum Rye Entertainment, a media branding company. “Certainly, companies might want to attach themselves to her social media and do some branding to reach the millions of followers she has, but these are mid-five to low six-figure deals.” It’s unclear if Jenner can sell makeup or fashion, but trans is hot, so all presumptions are off. “Jazz Jennings landed a Clean & Clear campaign, and Lea T is now the face of Redken,” said James Fox, CEO of Red Peak Branding. “Last year, Barneys released a campaign featuring 17 transgender models.” Will it play in Peoria?

Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. Context: During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless. Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions. Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Question: Were there other details of these changes?. Whats the answer?","completion":"So, Expose is a group of singers who sing and dance together. They became famous a long time ago between 1984 and 1993. They had many hit songs that people liked to dance to and listen to on the radio. But while they were making their first album, some of the singers in the group changed. Some singers quit or were asked to leave because their bosses didn't think they could be big stars. They were then replaced by new singers named Jeanette, Gioia, and Ann. The singers who left Expose, like Laurie, Alejandra, and Sandee, went on to do other things by themselves. They made their own music and sang in different places. Alejandra and Sandee even sang for a group called Will to Power, along with Gioia from the new Expose lineup. Sadly, Sandee passed away in 2008. As for other details, people have different stories about why and how the changes happened, but the important thing is that Expose continued with new members and became very successful!"},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who noted the building's resemblance and \\"strong architectural kinship\\" to the Romney Presbyterian Church? ?

Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. That's badly but accurately put. We know space travel is a risky enterprise. There's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions, radiation, stress-related symptoms etc, and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments. They knew stuff could go wrong. In fact, stuff had gone wrong. It's called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. Assorted mistakes/comments I hadn't even to look up: 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well duh. That's what I would've done. It was the apex of a propaganda war, after all. 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up. (This is \\"only\\" implicit, though.) Yeah, that's why they let people and press watch in almost-real-time. 3) The capsule ejection wouldn't work. Like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There's a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere. 4) One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida. I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole, 'cause if not, I'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong. 5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today, the reason being that it must not crash. It's even worse for spacecraft, because their computers must be built of comparably large components that aren't that susceptible to radiation. (And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway, so a complex steering system like the B2's wouldn't do.) What's with the fact that they were using \\"TV screens\\" rather than \\"computer screens\\"? It's the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition. 6) \\"If that object wasn't part of the rocket, it could be only one thing.\\" We see where this is going. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it wasn't a rocket part? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you don't know what it is, it's by definition an Unidentified Flying Object. 7) The voice-over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander's radiation foil was actually its hull. Which would make it thinner than a space suit. 8) Neil Armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I hadn't seen it before. As I said, any piece of manifest technology can go wrong, especially if it's not been tested sufficiently on account of being, you know, unprecedented. 9)The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the Moon's density) was at no time acutely life-threatening. Neither was the \\"fifteen seconds of fuel left\\", which was, in fact, \\"fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module\\". 10) A \\"catastrophic chain of events\\" usually results in catastrophe. I really don't know how to put it any simpler. This, however, is a prime example of the rhetoric used. 11) There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid, followed by the voice-over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior \\"can now be revealed\\". Turns out, he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff. 12) It's mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely so. 13) There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voice-over presents this \\"fact\\" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. Appollo 13 was a near-loss, but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience. 14) What the hell's up with the UFO? Even in the context of the movie, it makes no sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history, science, or rhetorics). Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure. Catch-phrases like \\"covered up until now\\", \\"publically revealed here for the first time\\", come up, but the film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything, which could be expected of a film so emotionally done. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except \\"NASA scientist\\". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor? Fancy that. What does this have to do with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, which point. In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment.

Answer:","completion":"Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr. was born on October 2, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois. He was an accomplished individual right from the start, demonstrating a keen interest in serving his nation. His commitment led him to join the United States Air Force, where he rose to the rank of Major. In 1967, he was selected for the United States Air Force MOL group, contributing significantly to the nation's astronaut program. Despite the mission notation being absent, Lawrence's role as a United States Air Force Astronaut speaks volumes about his extraordinary abilities. Adding to his impressive resume, Lawrence was also a skilled test pilot, a high-risk job that underlines his bravery. Tragically, his dedication to service led to his untimely demise during a training exercise. On December 8, 1967, Lawrence was tragically killed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The sudden demise of such a promising astronaut during training left a significant vacuum in the United States Air Force. His memory remains an encouraging symbol for future astronauts and serves as a powerful reminder of the risks and sacrifices associated with space exploration.

In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the given premise. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis to understand this better. Premise: The statement given as the premise is that it is best to book in advance for the activities at The Ark, as it has become quite popular, and activities sometimes fill up in advance. This suggests that due to the popularity of The Ark, there is a risk of not being able to participate in the activities if one doesn't book in advance. The contact information, including the telephone number and fax number, is provided to encourage booking ahead of time. Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that there is plenty of room at The Ark, and there is no need to book in advance. This implies that there is ample space and availability for all who wish to join the activities, and booking beforehand is not necessary. Comparison: When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it is clear that they contradict each other. The premise suggests that The Ark's popularity leads to a higher likelihood of activities being fully booked, necessitating advance booking to ensure participation. Conversely, the hypothesis claims that there is ample room at The Ark, eliminating the need for advance booking.

If you would prefer talking to someone else, feel free to find a therapist to talk to. Sharing stories and thinking of the positive times you shared with your cat can be healing and therapeutic.

In your attempt to seek supportive friends and family members, you may come across some individuals who are not sympathetic to your loss. For instance, some people may not understand the close bond you had with your cat and say things like “get over it” or “move on, it’s only a cat.” It is your grief, so don't let anyone tell you when it is time to move on.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: French people pride themselves on their delicious foods, such as cheese, baguettes and croissants(two kinds of food). In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France. Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money. Similarly, a Pizza Hut wouldn't overlook Egypt's Great Pyramid if no one wants to sit in it. Maybe next time you visit the Great Wall, you should think twice before ordering a Cappuccino in the Starbucks. Options: A The traditional stores of a country are forced to fight back. B The traditional stores of a country become dependant. C They have negative effect on a country's culture. D The multi-billion dollar chain can't be matched. Answer: C They have negative effect on a country's culture.

Unbeknownst to the townspeople, Mayor Hartman’s criminal connections run deep, helping him maintain control through blackmail, bribery, and manipulation. On the surface, he appears to be a kind and charismatic leader, but as the town's workings behind closed doors unravel, the truth about his sinister activities begins to surface. The story begins with the arrival of newcomer Becca Wallace, an ambitious investigative reporter, who has been sent to Gull's Bay by her editor to cover the town's quaint charms and history. As she explores the town and interviews its residents, Becca quickly becomes intrigued by the rumors and whispers about Mayor Hartman's double life. Sensing a breakthrough story, she begins to dig deeper into the mayor's hidden past, seeking the proof she needs to expose his corruption. Her investigation pits her against Sheriff Thompson, a reluctant ally and longtime friend of Hartman, who has turned a blind eye to the mayor's misconduct. Both men had been instrumental in driving out a dangerous biker gang some twenty years ago, making them heroes in the eyes of the town. Thompson initially clashes with Becca and tries to convince her that Hartman is innocent, but as he delves into the allegations, he finds his skepticism wavering. As the movie unfolds, Becca and Sheriff Thompson uncover a network of corruption involving the mayor that expands far beyond Gull's Bay. It spans the county and reaches even higher echelons of power. Together, they gather a small group of trusted allies, including a former gang member-turned-community activist named Zara and an idealistic young town clerk named Danny, to build their case against Hartman. In a climactic showdown, Becca presents her evidence to the town, bringing the truth about Mayor Hartman to light. As Hartman's once-loyal supporters turn against him, he becomes desperate and attempts to gain the upper hand, culminating in a thrilling chase through Gull's Bay. Hartman ultimately meets his downfall when Sheriff Thompson takes a stand against him, finally choosing the path of justice over the bonds of the past. In the aftermath, Gull's Bay begins to rebuild and mend from the scars of Hartman's regime. New leaders emerge from the community, dedicated to transparency and honesty, hoping to restore the town's once cherished values. Through her dedication to exposing the truth and making a difference, Becca cements her place as an influential journalist, and a reformed Sheriff Thompson strengthens his commitment to upholding the law. \\"Hartman's Reckoning\\" is a gripping drama that blends elements of suspense and action to tell a powerful story about the fight against corruption, the importance of journalistic integrity, and the redemptive power of truth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He's a world well-known on space and time. Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end? Stephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy . Because of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams or to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Here is a hypothesis: Insects are the majority of the population at the wooden bridges and reed beds. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise presented explains the landscape of an area along a water's edge with footpaths, wooden bridges, and reed beds. It indicates the presence of a rich diversity of bird and water life, but it doesn't specifically mention insects or their population size. The hypothesis, on the other hand, posits that insects are the majority of the population at the wooden bridges and reed beds. Assuming that the premise is true, it is not automatically guaranteed that the hypothesis is equally true. This is because the premise and the hypothesis are dealing with slightly different variables. The premise is focused on setting an environmental backdrop, addressing the physical aspects of this environment and highlighting the presence of bird and water life. However, it does not delve into a closer evaluation of the smaller fauna that inhabits the area, specifically the insect population. The hypothesis is more focused on a fundamental aspect of the ecosystem that is not explicitly addressed in the premise — the population of insects. Insects are a crucial part of any ecosystem and are indeed often abundant near water and reed beds. However, without concrete information correlating the premise to the insect population, it's not possible to definitively conclude the hypothesis is also true. The argument could be more solid if some linkage was established between the premise and the hypothesis, for example, if the premise mentioned anything about the biodiversity or the insect population in that area specifically. In conclusion, based on the information given, if the premise is true, it does not necessarily follow that the hypothesis is also true. The conclusion about the insect population requires additional supporting evidence not provided in the premise.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

(Vincent Groves is a suspected serial killer in Denver whose crimes are being reinvestigated using DNA technology to solve cold cases that have remained unsolved for 30 years.) The dark cloud of suspicion surrounding the alleged serial killer Vincent Groves has once again gathered momentum, as authorities in Denver turn to advanced DNA technology to unravel the mysteries of numerous cold cases dating back nearly three decades. Through the diligent efforts of forensic experts, these long-standing unsolved murder cases may finally be linked to Groves, providing a degree of closure for the families of the victims. Step 2: Explain who Vincent Groves is and what he is accused of. (Vincent Groves was a convicted murderer, and police suspect him of being involved in various killings in the Denver area.) Vincent Groves, now deceased, was a convicted murderer who served time in prison for two distinct killings. However, over the years, law enforcement officials have grown increasingly convinced that Groves is responsible for the deaths of many more victims in the Denver area. Step 3: Discuss the role of DNA technology in solving the cold cases. (Explain that forensic scientists are using DNA technology to analyze evidence from old crime scenes to find possible links to Vincent Groves.) In a bid to solve the string of unsolved murders, forensic scientists are turning to cutting-edge DNA technology to meticulously analyze evidence collected from the old crime scenes. This painstaking process has opened the possibility to unmask links between these cold cases and the suspected serial killer Vincent Groves, implying that justice may not be far off. Step 4: Describe the potential impact of the investigation on the families of the victims. (Highlight how the ongoing investigation and possible resolution of the cases may offer some closure and satisfaction to the victims' loved ones.) The renewed investigation has instilled a glimmer of hope in the hearts of the victims' families, who have long waited for answers and justice for their loved ones. Confirming Groves' involvement in these murders may offer a sense of closure and alleviate some of the anguish that has haunted the grieving families for decades. Step 5: Conclude the article by summarizing the importance of technology and efforts of the authorities. (Emphasize the significance of using advanced technology to solve cold cases and the relentless efforts of the authorities to pursue justice.) The adoption of innovative DNA techniques by forensic experts and the unwavering determination of the Denver authorities demonstrate their commitment to solving these age-old mysteries, even as time continues to pass. In embracing advanced technology to revive and analyze crucial evidence, investigators may finally inch closer to unveiling the full extent of Vincent Groves' grisly exploits, shedding new light on the darkest pages of Denver's criminal history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all.

Polow da Don will produce Fergie's next album.","completion":"While Polow da Don and Fergie have collaborated on the song \\"M.I.L.F. \\" from Fergie's second studio album, \\"Double Dutchess,\\" we cannot definitively infer that he will produce her next album. Collaborations between artists and producers can be for specific songs, projects, or multiple projects over time, but they may not necessarily include all future works. It is also crucial to note that artists often collaborate with various producers and songwriters throughout their career, experimenting with different sounds and styles. Thus, Fergie's next album could potentially involve collaborations with other producers and songwriters apart from Polow da Don, even if they had a successful partnership on \\"M.I.L.F. .\\" Additionally, the music industry is quite unpredictable and can involve many behind-the-scenes factors, such as label restrictions, budget constraints, and personal choices that influence which producers and artists collaborate on specific projects. In conclusion, although Polow da Don and Fergie have successfully collaborated on \\"M.I.L.F. ,\\" we cannot make a definitive inference that he will produce her next album. For such information, it's best to keep an eye out for official announcements from Fergie, her management, or her record label regarding her upcoming projects and producer collaborations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Brian Massumi (born 1956) is a Canadian social theorist, writer and philosopher, He is widely known for his English-language translations of A Thousand Plateaus, a 1980 philosophy book by French authors Gilles Deleuze and who, respectively a philosopher and a psychoanalyst? A:","completion":"Brian Massumi, born in 1956, is a highly respected Canadian social theorist, writer, and philosopher who gained significant recognition for his English-language translations of \\"A Thousand Plateaus,\\" a seminal 1980 philosophy book written by two notable French authors – Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was a French philosopher widely acclaimed for his work in the field of continental philosophy, influencing various subjects such as literature, art, and social theory. His work traverses a broad spectrum of philosophical themes, including metaphysics, aesthetics, epistemology, and ethics. Among his most significant works are \\"Difference and Repetition\\" (1968) and \\"The Logic of Sense\\" (1969), which address issues of identity, representation, and language. Deleuze often collaborated with other intellectuals, the most notable partnership being with Guattari. Félix Guattari (1930-1992) was a psychoanalyst, political militant, and philosopher who co-founded the École Freudienne de Paris with psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in 1964. Guattari's work delved into various intellectual disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and political theory. He developed the concept of \\"schizoanalysis,\\" a critical method aimed at challenging the traditional psychoanalytic view of mental health and illness. Guattari is also known for his work as an activist for various leftist causes throughout his life. The collaboration between Deleuze and Guattari commenced in the late 1960s, resulting in a profound friendship that generated innovative theoretical contributions to contemporary philosophy, political thought, and cultural criticism. Their joint works include \\"Anti-Oedipus\\" (1972) and \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" (1980), both of which form two volumes of their magnum opus, \\"Capitalism and Schizophrenia.\\" These works are emblematic of their profound critique of psychoanalysis, capitalism, and various societal structures. \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" adopts a non-linear, experimental approach to writing, incorporating a rhizomatic structure that allows for multiple points of entry and interpretation. This innovative style reflects the book's core philosophical themes, such as multiplicity, deterritorialization, and the emphasis on becoming rather than being. The book's overarching objective is to present an alternative vision of thought that fosters creativity, freedom, and resistance to various forms of oppression. Brian Massumi's English translation of \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" played a pivotal role in bringing the groundbreaking work of Deleuze and Guattari to a broader audience, thus amplifying its impact on various academic disciplines. In addition to his translation work, Massumi has made substantial contributions to fields such as semiotics, cultural theory, and political philosophy. Through his exploration of topics such as affect, experience, and perception, he has continued to develop the ideas initiated by Deleuze and Guattari, further cementing their place in contemporary social theory and philosophy. In conclusion, Brian Massumi's translation of \\"A Thousand Plateaus,\\" authored by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, not only enhanced the accessibility and understanding of the French philosophers' groundbreaking collaboration but also contributed significantly to the development of contemporary social theory, literature, and cultural critique. The works of these three scholars, built upon a solid theoretical foundation and innovative explorations of thought, continue to inspire generations of academics and readers across various disciplines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nigerian unions resumed talks with the government Saturday following days of national protests over corruption and soaring fuel prices in Africa's largest oil producer. The two sides met ahead of a promised labor shutdown of the Nigerian oil industry. In solidarity with protesters, the oil union has threatened to stop production if the government does not reinstate subsidies that will return the cost of fuel to previous levels. A decision to halt production would affect global oil prices; Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter. Throngs of protesters have rallied to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. \\"This is not the first time the subsidy has been removed in Nigeria. For two decades, every single government has done this,\\" said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the nation's finance minister. \\"There is a very short memory. It has always resulted in resistance and a strike and so on.\\" A deal had not been reached to avert the shutdown as talks stretched into early Sunday. While negotiations remained ongoing, one union leader said oil workers will resume their strike Monday. Earlier, labor unions urged protesters to take a break from their five-day strike Saturday and Sunday to stock up on food and water supplies. Stores and supermarkets shut down as part of the national strike were set to reopen over the weekend to allow protesters to get supplies, said Folorunso Oginni, chairman of the nation's oil union, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria. Despite the strike suspension, the deadline to shut down oil production is still in effect unless the government and labor unions reach an agreement, he said. The protests -- dubbed \\"Occupy Nigeria\\" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free funds to improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. \\"It is to now to try to move this forward regain the people's trust. They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,\\" the finance minister said Friday. In addition to the protests, the government faces another crisis -- religious attacks that have heightened fears of sectarian violence in parts of the country. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers, Kim Chakanetsa and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.

This could make the prices of fuel go up all over the world because Nigeria is one of the places that gives lots of fuel to other countries. The government says they'll try to fix some of the problems, but many people don't trust them to do it because the government has sometimes been dishonest.

Cue the DJ to drop the beat and let people sing along once you've coached them on the chorus. If you want people to be into the music, you've got to be into it to. Move around, feel the beat, and look like you're excited to be on stage. If you stand stock-still at the mic stand and look like you're bored, people will look the same way in the crowd. If you're well prepared, you should feel confident in your abilities and in your music, so you can throw yourself into putting on the best possible show you can for the people. It's time to shine. Give them a performance they'll never forget. Make sure you've got all your lyrics memorized and have practiced using the mic so you can be confident that all the technical aspects of the performance are going to go off without a hitch. It's hard to perform with confidence if you're trying to remember all the words. It's always important to do a mic check before performing. Part of the work of performance is being there before the show to make sure everything is set up and working as planned. Don't be a fake rock star and blow off the pre-show responsibilities. Be a professional. Always go on stage sober and well-rested. Save the partying for after the show. It'll be hard to get into your music if you're mush mouthed, too quiet, or muddy in the mix. Rap shouldn't sound like one of the adults from old Peanuts cartoons. Put your vocals up front and make sure it's loud enough to be heard from all corners of the room. If you have trouble keeping your voice up while you perform, practice reading magazines and books out loud to get your voice naturally into a louder register. It might annoy your roommates, but it'll be worth it to amp up your performance to where it needs to be. Both at your shows and online, be active about interacting with your growing fanbase. The MC will be the face of the crew, so you need to take the publicity side of the rap game seriously. Stay out after your gigs to meet people and sell any merch that you have, being friendly and available. Encourage people to come out to the gigs on social media and respond to people personally on Twitter and Facebook. Rappers, maybe more so than any other group of musicians, are known for taking control of their social media and working it to its fullest potential. You're just as likely to get signed to a record deal from a popular YouTube video as a successful mixtape.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of owning the stage as an MC, engaging with the audience, preparing well, staying professional, and effectively utilizing social media to grow a fanbase and boost performance success."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island swim masses of colorful tropical fish. Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40.

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 21:17 EST, 12 December 2013 | UPDATED: 21:18 EST, 12 December 2013 The mother of a man who died in a prison fire after being sent back to Honduras despite receiving a stay of deportation is suing the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his death. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez, 20, arrived in the U.S. seeking asylum in 2008 to escape gang members who were trying to recruit him. He was ordered deported when he missed a hearing in Immigration Court, but his attorney Joseph Huprich filed an emergency motion and Avila-Lopez was granted an emergency stay of deportation. Ana Lopez says","completion":"her son's life was cut tragically short due to the negligence and misconduct of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to the lawsuit filed by Lopez and her attorney, multiple oversights and failures in the process ultimately led to the unnecessary death of her young son. Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez was initially placed in ICE detention upon arrival in the U.S., where he awaited his immigration court hearing. It was at this point, however, that the first failure occurred. Lopez claims that her son was not provided with adequate notice of his scheduled court date, thus resulting in his inadvertent absence from the hearing. Consequently, the court ordered his deportation based on his failure to appear. This unfortunate misunderstanding prompted Avila-Lopez's attorney, Joseph Huprich, to file an emergency motion for an immediate stay of deportation, highlighting the danger his client faced if returned to Honduras. Following a swift review of the case, the court granted the emergency stay, sparing Avila-Lopez from potential harm at the hands of his initial persecutors. Despite the court-ordered stay, due to what can only be considered as a grave error on the part of ICE detention facility staff, Avila-Lopez was deported back to Honduras. This horrifying instance of miscommunication led to him being imprisoned in a facility known for its dangerous and inhumane conditions. It was here that he lost his life in a prison fire, a tragedy that could have been easily avoided had ICE properly heeded the court's decision. Ana Lopez's lawsuit against ICE seeks justice for her son's wrongful death, holding the responsible parties accountable for their negligence in managing his case. She hopes the suit will expose the flaws in the immigration detention and deportation system, ultimately leading to increased transparency, improved communication, and enhanced safeguards to protect the lives of those held under ICE custody. In order to achieve these goals, Lopez and her attorney are requesting a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding her son's deportation and subsequent death. They are also calling for comprehensive reforms and increased oversight to ensure such tragedies are not repeated in the future. In the wake of the lawsuit, the case of Nelson Javier Avila-Lopez has attracted national attention and reignited an ongoing debate surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers in the United States. Advocates for change argue that this heartbreaking story is emblematic of a larger issue in the country's immigration system and are urging lawmakers to revisit the policies and practices that contributed to the untimely death of this young man seeking refuge from danger."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Skylar told her friends how much she disliked her math class that day.

But here's the current math: what's less than nothing? And if you do even less than nothing, at what point does it become completely counterproductive and silly? Have you noticed lately that real ideas are out of vogue? A serious GOP committee chairman makes a big — and, yes, controversial -- proposal to reform the tax code. Here's how his ultimate leader, House Speaker John Boehner, reacts when asked about parts of the plan: \\"Blah, blah, blah blah.\\" No kidding. The President, who once endorsed an idea to change the way Social Security benefits are calculated as a way to curb its growth, has now said \\"Never mind.\\" It won't be in his budget, for fear that his liberal base would desert him over it. Republicans, who started the year saying that immigration reform should be on the agenda, are now saying, as the speaker put it, the President can't be \\"trusted\\" to implement any serious measure. And Democrats say the President can't be trusted to do a trade agreement without angering the important constituency of organized labor, so bye-bye \\"fast track\\" trade bill. Bill to help veterans fails Truth is, it isn't about trust at all. It's about winning in 2014. And an important part of winning, it seems, is to paper over all dissent within your own party in order to present a united front to the voters. So the election will be this: Us or them? Obamacare or no Obamacare? Do you like me better? Do you like government? Do you like poor people or rich people? That's our debate -- the sum total of our big ideas right now. Not wanting to start any fights within your own party. Unity above all heading into the midterm elections. So maybe Congress should just close up shop and leave town because nothing is going to happen for the next nine months. Just turn off the lights. Both parties are making the same political calculation for the same reason: They can't afford to have any internal debate lest they seem less than united against the enemy. Turns out that the permanent campaign is still alive and well. Here's the glitch in this narrative: Voters, it turns out, actually want some solutions to problems. They want to see the deficit go down; they want to find a way to fix immigration. A majority (63%) is worried the country is on the wrong track. And, according to a new CBS/New York Times poll, eight in 10 Americans are fed up with Washington. Somehow, voters haven't gotten the message that Congress -- in its steadfast intent to accomplish nothing -- is just trying to appeal to them. But remember what happened to Mitt Romney's campaign. Romney lost for lots of reasons, but one of them was sticking too long to the assumption that if people were unhappy with the direction of the country and the other guy, that would be enough to win. It wasn't. The candidate mattered. And ideas mattered, too. The \\"big\\" GOP idea this time is to bash Obamacare, relentlessly, endlessly, in a continual loop. Sure, it's unpopular, but what about if it starts working for people? What if people are sick of hearing about it now that the website is working? And what if people are more inclined to mend it than end it? If Obamacare is the only trick in the bag, it might not be enough. Then there's the Democrats' income inequality refrain. It's not new, it can work, and sure, it unites the Democrats. But by taking almost everything of substance off the table, it's the President's legacy and record of achievement that gets compromised, along with the voters. The truth is this: It's a tight political fight. Polls right now show that the public, by a small 42%-39% margin, would back Republicans for office in the 2014 midterm elections. They're not thrilled with the President's job performance. They have soured on the President personally, and they can barely stomach the Congress. So what's the political solution? No substance, no ideas, no serious debate that might actually engage voters. Each side suits up, armed with its slogans and its bromides. And we inevitably re-elect the Congress we hate.

Article: There are three different ways to store fish. Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish. Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams. Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about...

The Electoral College officials certified this ballot as a vote for John Edwards for president. The remaining nine electors cast ballots for John Kerry. All ten electors in the state cast ballots for John Edwards for vice president (John Edwards's name was spelled correctly on all ballots for vice president). This was the first time in U.S. history that an elector had cast a vote for the same person to be both president and vice president; another faithless elector in the 1800 election had voted twice for Aaron Burr, but under that electoral system only votes for the president's position were cast, with the runner-up in the Electoral College becoming vice president (and the second vote for Burr was discounted and re-assigned to Thomas Jefferson in any event, as it violated Electoral College rules). Q: What is different in comparison between the 1800 electoral system and the system in place in 2004?","completion":"Imagine if you and your friends are picking team leaders and helpers. In the 1800 electoral system, everyone voted for two people they wanted to be team leaders. The person with the most votes would be the main team leader (president), and the person with the second-most votes would be the helper (vice president). However, this system caused some problems, like when two people got the same number of votes. To fix this, they changed the way of voting by 2004. Now, everyone votes separately for the team leader (president) and the helper (vice president). This way, there is less confusion, and everybody knows who is chosen to be the team leader and the helper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"come\\" mean the same thing in \\"Come out of the closet!\\" and \\"He comes from humble origins.\\"?","completion":"No, the word \\"come\\" does not mean the same thing in the phrases \\"Come out of the closet!\\" and \\"He comes from humble origins.\\" In these two contexts, \\"come\\" carries different meanings, which can be categorized into different senses or uses. Let's discuss and contrast the meanings of the word \\"come\\" in these two examples: 1. \\"Come out of the closet!\\": In this context, the word \\"come\\" functions as an imperative verb, which is a form of command or a request for someone to do something. Here, the speaker asks or urges someone to \\"come out\\" – literally, they are asking the person to leave an enclosed space such as a closet, but the phrase is often used figuratively, especially when referring to someone revealing their true identity, usually in the context of sexuality or LGBTQ+ matters. This idiomatic expression is conveying the idea of opening up about one's true identity, orientation, or desires, and it is a call to action for the listener to disclose their hidden truth. 2. \\"He comes from humble origins.\\": In this context, \\"comes\\" is used in its present simple form and serves as a stative verb. Stative verbs describe unchanging situations or conditions rather than actions or events. In this case, \\"comes from\\" alludes to a person's background or the place, situation, or circumstances from which they originate. \\"Humble origins\\" refers to modest, unprivileged, or low social and economic beginnings. So, this phrase is highlighting that the person comes from a humble background and emphasizes their roots or their upbringing. This usage of \\"come\\" does not involve any active task, request, or imperative command, like in the first example. In summary, the word \\"come\\" has different meanings in these two phrases. In \\"Come out of the closet!\\", \\"come\\" represents an imperative command for someone to reveal their hidden truths, whereas in \\"He comes from humble origins.\\", \\"come\\" denotes a reference to a person's humble background or upbringing. These different meanings depend on the specific context of the word use and showcase the versatility of the term \\"come\\" in the English language."},{"prompt":"Background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what Jordan should have done: 1. Reflect on his actions: Jordan should have taken a moment to analyze his actions that led to the teacher's emotional response. This self-reflection would help him to understand whether his behavior was intentional or unintentional. 2. Empathize with the teacher: After recognizing his actions, Jordan should have put himself in the teacher's shoes and tried to understand the pain and distress he might have caused her. Empathy is crucial in acknowledging one's actions and their impact on others. 3. Apologize to the teacher: Upon realizing the hurtful nature of his actions, Jordan should have taken responsibility for them and sincerely apologized to the teacher. An honest apology has the potential to mend strained relationships and demonstrate maturity and accountability. 4. Listen to the teacher's perspective: After apologizing, Jordan should have given the teacher an opportunity to express her feelings and thoughts on the situation. Engaging in active listening would show respect for her opinion and allow both parties to better understand each other's perspectives. 5. Discuss and learn from the incident: In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Jordan should have discussed the incident openly, listened to the teacher's suggestions, and demonstrated his willingness to learn from the situation. 6. Seek guidance from a counselor or school authority: If the issue was still unresolved or had escalated further, Jordan would have been wise to consult with a school counselor, principal, or other appropriate authority figure. This would help facilitate a conversation around the incident and potentially offer guidance or mediation between Jordan and the teacher. 7. Identify ways to make amends: Jordan should have considered possible ways to make amends for his actions, such as writing a heartfelt letter, offering to help the teacher with her tasks, or performing acts of kindness for her and others in the school community. Such actions can show genuine remorse and a willingness to take positive steps toward personal growth. In conclusion, Jordan should have taken the necessary steps to right his wrongs and make amends with the teacher before leaving the room.

A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out Down with liberty! or Long live chains! The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers. The captain caresses a statue of a medieval woman and is knocked unconscious by her husband (a knights funerary statue). In revenge, the captain exhumes the body of the wife to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.Cut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park; there are implications of child abduction or pedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns). The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny.

Premise: uh-huh what what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass Hypothesis: It's too bad you've never been fishing. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Available choices: (A). yes. (B). it is not possible to tell. (C). no. And the answer is:","completion":"(C). no. The hypothesis, \\"It's too bad you've never been fishing,\\" is not entailed by the premise, which is asking about the type of bait used for crappie and bass. The premise simply conveys a desire to know the appropriate choice of bait for these two fish species, and does not necessarily suggest that the individual has no prior experience with fishing. Now, to answer the question about bait for crappie and bass, let's dive into the details. Fishing for crappie and bass requires knowledge of their behavior and preferred habitats, as well as understanding the most effective bait types for each species. Although different baits may be used successfully for both fish, there are some baits that tend to perform better for each species. For crappie: Crappie are generally more active and found in larger numbers near underwater structures, such as submerged trees, vegetation, and even sunken artificial habitats. They primarily feed on smaller fish, insects, and crustaceans. Here are some popular bait options for crappie fishing: 1. Live Minnows: Live minnows are one of the most popular and effective baits for crappie, as they are an essential part of their natural diet. Rigging a live minnow beneath a slip bobber or using a jighead can yield excellent results. 2. Jigs: Small jigs in various colors and styles can also be highly effective for crappie. Colors like chartreuse, black, and white tend to work well, but it's essential to experiment with different color patterns and jigging motions to find the most successful combination. 3. Insect imitations: Crappie may also be enticed by artificial lures that imitate insects and small aquatic invertebrates. Soft plastic lures like tube baits, grubs, and shad tails often prove fruitful, as do small spinners and beetle spins. For bass: Bass are aggressive predators that are attracted to a wide variety of bait, depending on their mood and environmental conditions. Commonly found in areas with cover and structure, they prey on smaller fish, crawfish, and insects. Some popular bait choices for bass fishing include: 1. Soft Plastic Lures: Soft plastic lures like worms, craws, and creature baits are among the most versatile and effective baits for bass fishing. Texas-rigged soft plastics work great in heavy cover, while a Carolina-rigged worm can be the go-to setup in open water environments. 2. Crankbaits: Crankbaits mimic the movement and vibration of small fish in the water, attracting bass and provoking strikes. They come in various diving depths and colors, which should be chosen based on the current fishing environment and conditions. 3. Spinnerbaits and chatterbaits: These baits combine an attractive flash from a spinning blade with the added enticement of a soft plastic trailer that wiggles and swims like an injured prey. They work exceptionally well in areas with dense vegetation and underwater structures, where other lures might become snagged. 4. Topwater lures: Topwater lures like poppers, frogs, and walkers create commotion on the water's surface and can incite violent, explosive strikes from bass, especially during early morning and late evening hours. In conclusion, the best bait for crappie and bass will largely depend on the specific environment, the time of day, and the prevalent prey species in the area. Good angling practices dictate that you experiment with different bait options to determine which combination works best in each situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Police barricaded Istanbul's main Taksim Square and used water cannons to disperse crowds on Saturday to prevent demonstrators from entering Gezi Park, the site of protests for more than a month. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said the government won't permit \\"illegal\\" demonstrations in the park. \\"We will not and cannot permit demonstration or marches in those places,\\" the minister said. \\"Without it being a demonstration or a protest march, they can use Gezi Park as they please. We will not allow tents. \\"Right now in Istanbul there is a search and a push for ways to have illegal gatherings. Our police is not permitting this,\\" Guler said. Witnesses who spoke to CNN by phone reported use of water cannons and tear gas on Istiklal Street, one of the main arteries leading to Taksim Square. The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled some parts of the Taksim development project, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park. Taksim Solidarity, an umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, put out a call after ruling for people to gather in Gezi Park, which has not been open to the public since June 16. European Union, Turkey avoid rupture in relations. \\"We are going to our park to deliver the court decision by hand, which cancels the project aimed to disidentify, depopulate and concretize Gezi Park, to the ones who shut the park down to the people,\\" said Taksim Solidarity in a written statement. \\"We are going to our park to open its doors to its real owners, so to everyone again.\\" \\"They are in the smaller streets trying to prevent people from even reaching Istiklal,\\" said Irem Koker, an eyewitness.

I have a 12-year-old child waiting for me,\\" said a woman to a police officer blocking her way across what is normally one of the city's busiest transit hubs. She was dressed in the trenchcoat and headscarf popular among conservative Turkish Muslim women. \\"Until now I used to pray for you,\\" she told the police officer. \\"Now that has all changed.\\" As clashes continued in streets and back alleys of Istanbul's historic Beyoglu district, Istanbul's governor, Huseyin Avni Mutlu, responded to an amateur video that went viral on Turkish social media Saturday night. The video showed men armed with a large round sword and a stick attacking pedestrians in Istanbul's Talimhane district, which is adjacent to Taksim Square. One of the men with a machete is seen in the video beating a woman once with the blade and then kicking her in the small of the back. The amateur video also showed several police officers physically trying to separate the two men from the people they were attacking. An eyewitness told CNN he and several other anti-government protesters took shelter in a building in Talimhane when they saw the men shown in the video attacking demonstrators. \\"There were two guys in the middle of the street. We saw them from afar. They have these things that looked like swords, not knives but like rounded swords. They were running, swinging swords and kicking people,\\" the eyewitness said, on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. \\"I think they were out there to scare people. To give the message 'we're out here.' It wasn't like they were hiding the swords.\\" Mutlu said the suspected attackers had been detained by police. \\"The two people with swords and sticks that were part of the events that took place after the illegal protest in Taksim have been detained and are being processed,\\" Mutlu wrote on his official Twitter account. \\"Our security officer was wounded while trying to apprehend the attacker armed with a sword who was seen in videos,\\" Mutlu said. The Istanbul governor said that Gezi Park will open to the public Sunday, but that Taksim Solidarity's call for a demonstration is not legal and will not be permitted. \\"It is not legal to gather in Taksim. I cannot let you gather where the law says you cannot,\\" Mutlu told reporters on Saturday. \\"We are not going to allow this illegal gathering.

Based on Brian Selznick's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, it is about a boy who lives alone in the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris in the 1930s. A co-production between Graham King's GK Films and Johnny Depp's Infinitum Nihil, the film stars Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Jude Law, Helen McCrory, and Christopher Lee. Hugo is Scorsese's first film shot in 3D, of which the filmmaker remarked, \\"I found 3D to be really interesting, because the actors were more upfront emotionally. The film currently holds a 94% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes based on 206 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10. The site's main consensus reads, \\"Hugo is an extravagant, elegant fantasy with an innocence lacking in many modern kids' movies, and one that emanates an unabashed love for the magic of cinema.\\" Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 41 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying \\"Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about--movies.\\" Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor gave it a \\"B+\\" grade and termed it as \\"an odd mixture: a deeply personal impersonal movie\\" and concluded that \\"Hugo is a mixed bag but one well worth rummaging through.\\" Christy Lemire said that it had an \\"abundant love of the power of film; being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door\\" besides being \\"slightly repetitive and overlong\\". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune rated it three stars and described it as \\"rich and stimulating even when it wanders\\" explaining \\"every locale in Scorsese's vision of 1931 Paris looks and feels like another planet. The filmmaker embraces storybook artifice as wholeheartedly as he relays the tale's lessons in the importance of film preservation.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said that \\"visually Hugo is a marvel, but dramatically it's a clockwork lemon\\". Hugo was selected for the Royal Film Performance 2011 with a screening at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London on 28 November 2011 in the presence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall in support of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund. Richard Corliss of Time named it one of the Top 10 Best Movies of 2011, saying, \\"Scorsese's love poem, rendered gorgeously in 3-D, restores both the reputation of an early pioneer and the glory of movie history--the birth of a popular art form given new life through a master's application of the coolest new techniques\\".

This movie is special because it's the first movie Martin Scorsese made using 3D technology. 3D movies make it seem like you're watching the story happen in real life, with things popping out of the screen towards you. It's like you're there in the world of the movie. Scorsese used 3D in Hugo to make everything look more real and magical, making the people and the places in the movie stand out.

Importance Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reflects past glucose concentrations, but this relationship may differ between those with sickle cell trait (SCT) and those without it. Objective To evaluate the association between SCT and HbA1c for given levels of fasting or 2-hour glucose levels among African Americans. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study using data collected from 7938 participants in 2 community-based cohorts, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). From the CARDIA study, 2637 patients contributed a maximum of 2 visits (2005-2011); from the JHS, 5301 participants contributed a maximum of 3 visits (2000-2013). All visits were scheduled at approximately 5-year intervals. Participants without SCT data, those without any concurrent HbA1c and glucose measurements, and those with hemoglobin variants HbSS, HbCC, or HbAC were excluded. Analysis of the primary outcome was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association of SCT with HbA1c levels, controlling for fasting or 2-hour glucose measures. Exposures Presence of SCT. Main Outcomes and Measures Hemoglobin A1c stratified by the presence or absence of SCT was the primary outcome measure. Results The analytic sample included 4620 participants (mean age, 52.3 [SD, 11.8] years; 2835 women [61.3%]; 367 [7.9%] with SCT) with 9062 concurrent measures of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. In unadjusted GEE analyses, for a given fasting glucose, HbA1c values were statistically significantly lower in those with (5.72%) vs those without (6.01%) SCT (mean HbA1c difference, −0.29%; 95% CI, −0.35% to −0.23%). Findings were similar in models adjusted for key risk factors and in analyses using 2001 concurrent measures of 2-hour glucose and HbA1c concentration for those with SCT (mean, 5.35%) vs those without SCT (mean, 5.65%) for a mean HbA1c difference of −0.30% (95% CI, −0.39% to −0.21%). The HbA1c difference by SCT was greater at higher fasting (P = .02 for interaction) and 2-hour (P = .03) glucose concentrations. The prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes was statistically significantly lower among participants with SCT when defined using HbA1c values (29.2% vs 48.6% for prediabetes and 3.8% vs 7.3% for diabetes in 572 observations from participants with SCT and 6877 observations from participants without SCT; P<.001 for both comparisons). Conclusions and Relevance Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established cohorts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require further evaluation.

In 1948, the point-contact transistor was independently invented by German physicists Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker while working at the Compagnie des Freins et Signaux, a Westinghouse subsidiary located in Paris. Mataré had previous experience in developing crystal rectifiers from silicon and germanium in the German radar effort during World War II. Using this knowledge, he began researching the phenomenon of \\"interference\\" in 1947. By June 1948, witnessing currents flowing through point-contacts, Mataré produced consistent results using samples of germanium produced by Welker, similar to what Bardeen and Brattain had accomplished earlier in December 1947.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A flood occurs when a river overflows its banks. This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. Question: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" Answer: \\"Very flat\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The question asks: \\"What type of region might a floodplain develop into if a river floods often?\\" The answer to this question, based on the provided information, is not simply \\"very flat.\\" While it is indeed true that floodplains are often flat due to the spread of floodwater, the question is asking about the potential development of floodplains due to frequent flooding. Instead, a more appropriate and detailed answer might be: A floodplain that frequently experiences flooding might develop into a region characterized by nutrient-rich soil due to the sediment left behind by the floodwater. The sediment that the floodwater carries and subsequently deposits enriches the soil of the floodplain. This makes it an ideal place for plant growth and agriculture, as seen in the example of the Nile River valley. The regular flooding by the Nile River brings sediment that turns the surrounding floodplain into a productive agricultural area, despite it being in the middle of a desert. The floodplain could also develop natural levees along the river banks. Levees are raised strips of sediment that the floodwater deposits close to the river's edge. These occur naturally and can act as a protective barrier, potentially reducing the impact of future floods. Over time, frequent floods can lead to the growth of these levees and further change the physical characteristics of the floodplain region. Hence, a floodplain subjected to regular flooding might develop into a highly fertile agricultural region with potentially significant natural levee formations along the riverbanks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Problem:Context: The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.Pink (Bob Geldof), the protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944.The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Throughout his childhood, Pink longs for a father figure after he learns his father died in the war. At school, he is humiliated by his mean and stern teacher for writing poems in class. The poems that the teacher seizes from him and reads aloud are lyrics from \\"Money\\" from the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. Pink is also affected by his overprotective mother who spoils him by giving him whatever he wants.As an adult, Pink eventually gets married as his fame as a rock star grows, but he and his wife grow apart and she has an affair while Pink is on tour. When Pink learns of the affair, he compensates with expensive materialistic possessions and turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a fit of violence, causing her to flee the room in terror.Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \\"worms\\". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of Wish You Were Here, having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.The drugs cause Pink to hallucinate and he fantasises that he is a neo-Nazi dictator, his concert is a rally. His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities and rape the white girlfriend of a black man. Later, Pink holds a rally in suburban London, singing \\"Waiting for the Worms\\". The scene is inter-cut by images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins.Pink screams \\"Stop!\\" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" from The Final Cut album and \\"5:11 AM (The Moment Of Clarity)\\" from Roger Waters' The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial. He is depicted as a small, pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulturelike man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. The wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film.The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot. It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide. Question: Who sang \\"The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot\\"?

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What formation was the youngest of the Supai Group? ? An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the Supai Group from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today. Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta. This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color. Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is 100 to 300 feet (30 to 90 m) thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages 300 feet (90 m) thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 m) thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is 200 to 800 feet (60 to 200 m) thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. The type of tree you grow should be reliant on the environment where you'll be keeping it. Your region's climate and your home environment should both be taken into account when you're deciding which species of tree to grow. To be on the safe side, select a species that is indigenous to your part of the world. Deciduous species such as Chinese or Japanese elms, magnolias, oaks, and crabapple trees are good selections if you'd like to grow your bonsai outside. Just be sure to pick out a species that can grow to full size in your region. If you prefer coniferous trees, junipers, pines, spruces, or cedars all make excellent choices. If you want to grow a tree indoors (or if you live in a hot climate), consider a tropical species. Jade, snowrose, and olive trees may be grown as bonsais. Planting a bonsai tree from seed is a slow but rewarding process. If you plant a tree, you'll have to allow it time to take root and grow strong before you can begin trimming and training. Depending on the species of tree you grow, this could take up to five years. Many find the extra wait and effort to be worth it since seeds are so inexpensive and the grower is able to control the tree at every stage of growth. To grow a bonsai from seed, take the following steps: Buy a package of bonsai tree seeds. Soak them overnight before planting them in soil with good drainage and the right nutrient composition for your tree species. Plant the tree in a training container (as opposed to a ceramic display container, which is only used once the tree has been trained and reached maturity). Give the planted tree the correct amount of sun, water, and a consistent temperature, again dictated by the specific species of tree. Allow the tree to become sturdy and strong before you begin to train it. This method of acquiring a bonsai tree is highly valued, since caring for a bonsai tree you find in the wild requires a lot of skill and knowledge. If collecting a tree that has had its start in nature appeals to you, consider the following factors: Select a tree with a sturdy trunk, but one that is still quite young. Older trees won't adapt well to being placed in a container. Choose a tree with roots that spread evenly in every direction, rather than growing laterally or entangled with the roots of other trees. Dig around the tree and extract a large amount of soil along with the roots. This will prevent the tree from dying of shock when it is moved to a container. Plant the tree in a large training container. Care for it according to the needs of the particular species. Wait about a year for the roots to get used to the container before you begin training it. This is the easiest way to begin the art of bonsai, but it is also the most expensive. Bonsai trees that have been grown from seed and partially trained have already received a lot of time and care, so they are usually quite pricey. Look online and in local nurseries and plant shops for a bonsai tree to bring home with you. If you buy a partially-trained bonsai from a shop, talk with the person who trained it about its specific needs. When you bring the bonsai home, give it a few weeks to adjust to the new setting before you begin working with it.","completion":"Choose a tree species suitable for your environment and grow a bonsai from seed, find one in the wild, or buy a partially-trained one, considering factors such as climate, tree attributes, and caretaking steps specific to the tree species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb. Of the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing . Looking straight into my eyes, she said, \\"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \\"A foot has no nose.\\" It means, \\"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals.

In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - SEED is a block cipher developed by the Korea Information Security Agency (KISA). It is used broadly throughout South Korean industry, but seldom found elsewhere. It gained popularity in Korea because 40-bit encryption was not considered strong enough, so the Korea Information Security Agency developed its own standard. However, this decision has historically limited the competition of web browsers in Korea, as no major SSL libraries or web browsers supported the SEED algorithm, requiring users to use an ActiveX control in Internet Explorer for secure web sites. - In botany, a drupe (or stone fruit) is an indehiscent fruit in which an outer fleshy part (exocarp, or skin; and mesocarp, or flesh) surrounds a shell (the pit, stone, or pyrene) of hardened endocarp with a seed (kernel) inside. These fruits usually develop from a single carpel, and mostly from flowers with superior ovaries (polypyrenous drupes are exceptions). The definitive characteristic of a drupe is that the hard, \\"lignified\\" stone (or pit) is derived from the ovary wall of the flowerin an aggregate fruit composed of small, individual drupes (such as a raspberry), each individual is termed a drupelet and may together form a botanic berry. - Pan de coco , literally \`\` coconut bread '' in Spanish , is a rich sweet roll with a coconut filling . - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - The Arecaceae are a botanical family of perennial climbers, shrubs, acaules and trees commonly known as palm trees (owing to historical usage, the family is alternatively called Palmae).

It's a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, and it's set to hit Australia in July. Update: Turns out that this leak was spot on. The Google Nexus 7 built by Asus is a reality, with all the specifications listed here revealed days before this morning's I/O keynote by Gizmodo Australia. Check out the Nexus 7 and read how it all unfolded in our live blog. Gizmodo Australia has today viewed a training document detailing exactly what's going to be in the new tablet and how much it's going to cost. As rumoured, Google's going to announce a 7-inch, Nexus-branded tablet called the Nexus 7. According to the leak, it's built by Asus, with a 1.3Ghz quad-core Tegra 3 processor, GeForce 12-core GPU and 1GB of RAM with two different storage variants: 8GB and 16GB. The Nexus tablet will also feature NFC and run Google Wallet (probably only in the US) and Android Beam. The screen is an IPS display with a 178-degree viewing angle, running a resolution of 1280x800. The device will also sport a 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera. The battery will also give you nine hours worth of operation. The 8GB model will set you back US199 and the 16GB will cost US249. No word in the document on local prices. The leaked document also says that the device will be the first to run Jelly Bean, the new version of Android. Details are scarce on Jelly Bean, but the slides tell us that Google will handle operating system updates from now on, which could address the fragmentation problem. We aren't sure if this statement means that Google will handle all handset updates from Jelly Bean onwards, or if it just means it will handle it for the Nexus 7 going forward. Based on the various arrangements with other manufacturers and telcos around the world, it's likely to be the latter. We'll know more come Google I/O. Update: The document says that the Nexus 7 will run Android Jelly Bean, but makes no mention of the version number. We understand that the device will be version stamped with Android 4.1, rather than leaping ahead a generation and stamping it as 5.0. Wired had suggested after spotting a leaked benchmark that this would be the case. Rumours about Google working on a Nexus-branded tablet with Asus have been swirling for a while. Even as far back as May, a report emerged of a super cheap Tegra 3-powered device was coming at the Google I/O developer event, which is now only days away. The first clue was when Asus demonstrated the awesome cheap and wonderfully cheerful Eee Pad MeMO 370T at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, before delaying the unit indefinitely. Since then, rumours about a home-grown tablet from Google have been few and far between, but this is the first time we've seen anything official regarding specs. Apple has already played its announcement cards around iOS 6, Microsoft has announced Surface and Windows Phone 8, and Google risks being left behind without its own bespoke tablet product. June is one hell of a month to be following what's new in tech. Priced at sub-US200, the Google's Nexus 7 will become Amazon's biggest problem post-launch, threatening the market share of the hugely successful Kindle Fire. The Fire runs a highly modified version of the Android operating system and prevents users from wandering outside the customised Amazon environment. The Nexus brand, however, has always been associated with the purest form of the Android operating system Google has to offer, meaning that it's likely going to be a better experience. Google is also banking on the fact that the screen is better than the Fire's, with a higher resolution and 10-point touch capability. Of course, this could all prove to be an elaborate fake. We've seen them before and we'll see them as long as there's a rabid tech-loving public that will queue up around the block for value this good. We'll bring you the news as we hear it about this tablet, and if it really is the Nexus 7, I'm looking forward to this year's Google I/O. Follow Gizmodo Australia on Twitter for further updates. ||||| Computerworld - A 199 Nexus 7 tablet from Google would raise the stakes for Amazon's Kindle Fire and Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size. But since the 7-in. touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the Nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular Apple iPad or perhaps the Microsoft Surface tablets unveiled last week. The iPad starts at 499; pricing for the Surface has not yet been announced. To offer high-end features at a low cost with the Nexus 7, Google seems to be acknowledging that the Android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means Google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference. \\"If Google wants to jump-start the Android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that,\\" said Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates. \\"Google certainly has an incentive to make the Android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its OEMs (Original Equipment Makers).\\" Google could be subsidizing the Nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said. Even so, \\"getting revenues is the name of the game for Google, and right now the OEMs are driving very little revenue to them on Android-based tablets,\\" Gold said. The big payback to Google from selling a 199 tablet would come from the sales of apps and the ads that Google sells for its search tool, analysts noted. \\"Considering that the tablet ecosystem war is getting heated now with Microsoft having a bigger role, Google might feel the need for a more aggressive [pricing] strategy,\\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. She said that 40 million iPad sales in 2011 at a cost of 499 or more show there's room for Android sales, especially at lower prices. \\"You would think that 40 million would not seem impossible for the combination of all the vendors supporting Android,\\" she said. IDC said iPads accounted for 59% of tablet sales globally in 2011. Among Android tablets, Samsung had 6.3% of the market, and Asus took 2.5%. Amazon had 6.9% of the market with its Android variant and Barnes & Noble had 4.9%. \\"Google has to be more than a little frustrated that the first mainstream hit Android tablet is the Kindle Fire,\\" said Tom Mainelli, an analyst at IDC. \\"Google is desperate to get some market traction for Android tablets and the Google ecosystem that supports them.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"Google's flagship I/O Conference announced the Nexus 7, a 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet running Android Jelly Bean, set to be released in Australia in July.

Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire. and a hint : Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field. Please answer this question : Which piece of iron is more magnetized? Answer:","completion":"Piece B is more magnetized. This is because it was passed through the coil of wire with electricity running through it. Based on the historical knowledge provided, when a current-carrying wire is coiled, it acts like a permanent magnet, and if an iron piece is placed inside or passed through that coil, it gets magnetized. This phenomenon was discovered by François Arago and built upon by William Sturgeon, who found that having the iron bar inside the coil increases the magnetic field. In this situation, Kelsey passed Piece B through the coil of wire, which caused it to be magnetized, whereas Piece A was simply placed on her desk without any interaction with the magnetic field, so it remains less magnetized."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the first sentence, \\"The rate of production at the factory is skyrocketing,\\" the word \\"rate\\" refers to the speed or efficiency at which something is being produced. In this context, \\"rate\\" denotes a measurable metric of performance. 2. In the second sentence, \\"He works at a great rate,\\" the word \\"rate\\" can be understood to mean the speed, pace, or efficiency at which someone works. Although the meaning is related to the first sentence, it is more subjective, as \\"great rate\\" could mean different things to different people.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? from the following article ? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists (including legal philosophers and social theorists of law), hope to obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, of legal reasoning, legal systems, and of legal institutions. Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems in two rough groups: - The Quran (; ', literally meaning \\"the recitation\\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran\\"') is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\\"Allah\\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (\\"surah\\" in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (\\"ayah\\"). - Fiqh is Islamic jurisprudence. While \\"Sharia\\" is believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the Quran and the \\"Sunnah\\" (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), \\"fiqh\\" is the human understanding of the \\"Sharia\\"\\"sharia\\" expanded and developed by interpretation (\\"ijtihad\\") of the Quran and \\"Sunnah\\" by Islamic jurists (\\"Ulama\\") and implemented by the rulings (\\"Fatwa\\") of jurists on questions presented to them. - Sabzevar County is a county in Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran. The capital of the county is Sabzevar. At the 2006 census, the county's population (including portions of the county later split from it to form Joghatai County, Jowayin County, Khoshab County, and Davarzan County) was 429,187, in 116,891 families; excluding those portions, the population was 273,898 in 75,668 families. The county has four districts: Central District, Davarzan District, Rud Ab District, and Sheshtomad District. The county has four cities: Sabzevar, Davarzan, Rud Ab, and Sheshtomad. - Ulama (', singular ', \\"scholar\\", literally \\"the learned ones\\", also spelled \\"ulema\\"; feminine: \\"alimah\\" (singular) and \\"uluma\\" (plural)) are \\"those recognized as scholars or authorities\\" in the \\"religious hierarchy\\" of the Islamic religious studies. They are the guardians of legal and religious tradition in Islam. Often they are \\"Imams of important mosques, judges, teachers in the religious faculties of universities\\". The term may also include the body of Muslim Islamic scholars trained in the whole body of Islamic law and in other Islamic disciplines; but it may also be used to include the village mullahs and imams on the lowest rungs of the ladder of Islamic scholarship, inasmuch as they correspond most closely to the class of the scribes or rabbis in Judaism. - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders. - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Arab world ('; formally: '), also known as the Arab nation (\\"\\"), consists of the 22 Arabic-speaking countries of the Arab League. These Arab states occupy an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The contemporary Arab world has a combined population of around 422 million people, over half of whom are under 25 years of age. - Muhammad (c. 570 CE 8 June 632 CE) is the central figure of Islam and widely regarded as its founder by non-Muslims. He is known as the \\"Holy Prophet\\" to Muslims, almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam, believed by Muslims to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran, formed the basis of Islamic religious belief. - Razavi Khorasan Province (\\"Ostn-e Khorsn-e Raav\\") is a province located in northeastern Iran.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a news article: Some people just cannot do anything right. Take the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare. Centuries after he made his name, he is being blamed for bringing misery to millions. Not, as some might expect, from being forced to study his works at school, but for suffering stigma over unsightly skin. In what is a departure from the numerous studies looking at everything from leprosy to skin cancer, medical experts are claiming that Shakespeare’s success has resulted in a painful legacy for people will skin disease. The playwright is the subject of new research being revealed to hundreds of doctors during the annual conference of the British Association of Dermatologists. The rash of Shakespearean insults based on people’s appearance, whether it is King Lear branding his daughter Goneril “an embossed carbuncle” or a prostitute calling a soldier a “scurvy companion” in Henry IV part II, is cited as a cause of the continuing persecution of people for the way they look. In a paper entitled \\"Is Shakespeare to blame for the negative connotations of skin disease?\\", British researchers from the universities of Nottingham, Leicester and Derby claim that Shakespeare reflected the Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale skin, and while he “may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation”. Dr Catriona Wootton, a dermatologist at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, and co-author of the study, said: \\"Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease.” Shakespeare used these “negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour,” she added. A spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said: “Much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.\\" But fans of the playwright are rallying to his defence. Stuart Hampton-Reeves, head of the British Shakespeare Association, told The Independent: “Shakespeare was a product of his era so we cannot expect him to confirm to modern attitudes and it is far-fetched to blame modern day prejudices on Shakespeare's works.” And Professor Michael Dobson, the director of Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute, said: “Has any writer in history ever suggested that the symptoms of skin disease are attractive? And have audiences for the last 400 years really been coming out of theatres saying ‘Ah yes – I’d nearly forgotten – pox is to be avoided. What a genius Shakespeare was!’ Next week: has the fairy tale of Snow White been creating a misleadingly favourable impression of dwarfism?” Pox, carbuncles and plague: Shakespeare's lack of skin care Some of Shakespeare’s most memorable lines are insults over people’s appearance. Take King Lear for instance, when the beleaguered monarch berates his daughter Goneril: “Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle”. From phrases like “scurvy knave” used in Romeo and Juliet, to “a pox upon him” in All's Well That Ends Well and “foul moles and eye-offending marks” in King John, skin problems are referenced throughout Shakespeare’s plays. In Henry IV part I, a man with a red nose is dubbed “an everlasting bonfire-light” and “knight of the burning lamp”. And in Coriolanus, Marcius (Coriolanus) curses his enemies: “Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd.” Herpes is alluded to in A Winter’s Tale: “If I prove honey mouthed let my tongue blister”. While in A Midsummer's Night Dream, a blessing to young couples includes the line: “Never mole, hare-lip nor scar... shall upon their children be”. ||||| Shakespeare may be partly to blame for the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions, say experts. They point to memorable insults in his plays that refer to skin blemishes and scarring, reflecting an Elizabethan obsession with flawless pale complexions. One of the most graphic occurs when King Lear launches into his scheming daughter Goneril, declaring: ''Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle''. Other examples include use of the phases ''a pox upon him'' in All's Well That Ends Well and ''scurvy knave'' in Romeo and Juliet, while in Henry IV part one a man's red nose is described as ''an everlasting bonfire light''. Marcius Coriolanus wishes ''boils and plagues'' upon his enemies, and a young couple in A Midsummer's Night Dream are exhorted to have children with ''never mole, hare lip nor scar..'' Dermatologist Dr Catriona Wootton, from Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, who took part in a language analysis of Shakespeare's plays, said: ''Rat-infested and with open sewers, overcrowding and sexual promiscuity, Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. ''Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease. This was not limited to signs of infection, but to any blemishes or moles, which were considered ugly and signs of witchcraft or devilry. ''Shakespeare uses these negative undertones to his advantage, employing physical idiosyncrasies in his characters to signify foibles in their behaviour.'' The researchers argue that the Bard's colourful language has helped to perpetuate negative attitudes towards imperfect skin. Nina Goad, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ''It is interesting to note that much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. Over the last few decades dermatologists have tried to address the effect this can have on patients. However, even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. ''This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared. ''Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype. Many skin patients require psychological support to deal with the visual aspect of their disease.'' The findings were presented at the British Association of Dermatologists' annual conference in Glasgow. ends ||||| A new study by British dermatologists draws a connection between the bad attitude shown towards skin conditions in Shakespeare's works and the way we think of it today. Do we have a negative view of acne because of the writings of Shakespeare? A study by dermatologists in the UK recently examined whether our culture views skin blemishes negatively because of the amount of negative writings in Shakespeare’s plays about skin conditions. “While Shakespeare may not have accepted Elizabethan society’s negativity towards skin disease, it can be argued that his success has led to its perpetuation,” the study reads. The dermatologists note that many of the Bard’s works include people insulting others by mentioning skin conditions or by trying to curse someone with a skin affliction. A character says he wishes “a pox upon” another character in “All’s Well That Ends Well,” while in the text of “King John,” one character says that if another was “patch’d with foul moles and eye-offending marks, then I should not love thee, nor thou become thy great birth, nor deserve a crown.” However, they write that the playwright does say in “Hamlet” that those with skin conditions are not evil because of them, writing, “that for some vicious mole of nature in them, as in their birth – wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose hisorigin – their virtues else, be they as pure as grace, as inﬁnite as man may undergo, shall in general censure take corruption from that particular fault.” Fear of those with skin conditions arose from the dangers of diseases like the plague, write the dermatologists. “Tell-tale cutaneous signs heightened the fear of contagion,” they wrote. According to the Telegraph, British Association of Dermatologists member Nina Goad urged that the attitude not be passed down to future generations. “Even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice,” she said. “This is particularly concerning when such films are aimed at children, who learn that beautiful, flawless people are kind and trustworthy, and scarred or blemished people are to be feared. Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare, but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don't reinforce this stereotype.” However, some are doubtful of the dermatologists’ connection between Shakespeare and fear of skin afflictions. Guardian writer Alison Flood wrote that she found the conclusion “a stretch.” “It sort of assumes we might not have noticed that skin diseases aren't exactly the most pleasant thing in the world, if it wasn't for Mercutio gasping ‘A plague on both your houses,’” she wrote. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A study by British researchers suggests that William Shakespeare's plays have contributed to the social stigma associated with disfiguring skin conditions.

Article:","completion":"Title: Two-Year-Old Twins Successfully Separated in Amazing Operation Once upon a time, there were beautiful twin sisters named Angelica and Angelina Sabuco. The thing is, they were born a little bit different than most sisters because they were joined together at their chest and tummy. Now, this was hard for them because they couldn't play, run, or dance like other kids. So, the doctors decided they needed some help. The doctors planned a special operation to carefully separate Angelica and Angelina, so they could live more comfortably and happily like other kids. The operation was very important, and everyone was hoping it would go well. Can you imagine how happy the twins and their family would be if the doctors could help them? Well, guess what? All the doctors and nurses worked together as a team, and they did it! The operation was a big success and went \\"smoothly,\\" which means everything went just as they planned. The amazing doctors think that the twin sisters might even be able to wake up later today, after a good night's sleep.

This is because the doctors and nurses need to make sure they're healing well and are really really okay!
